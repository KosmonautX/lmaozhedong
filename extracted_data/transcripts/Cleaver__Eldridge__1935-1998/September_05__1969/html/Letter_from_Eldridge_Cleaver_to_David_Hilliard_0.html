By the time you receive this letter, our delegation (composed, as it looks now, of myself, brother Byron Muesi Booth, and Julia Wright. Julia is in Lagos, Nigeria at the moment and she may not make it. She is still hung up with that oppressor country radical of hers. We are supposed to leave here Monday, September 8, 1969. We should be able to generate some very strong support in Korea and throughout Asia. Look forward to messages from us.)</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs5EFED22F">(1) Here is a copy of a telegram sent by the Koreans; they and we here do not know whether or not you received it there. But here it is. It should be answered right away, signed by our Chief of Staff, and showing solidarity with the Korean people in our common struggle against U.S. Imperialism. It is very important that this be done right away because both telegrams will be used for a massive educational campaign throughout the world to generate support for Bobby and the Party.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs5EFED22F">(2) Here also is the text of the telegram in the Korean language, taken from the official organ of the Korean Govt. I suggest that we run these items in our newspaper: &ldquo;The Korean telegram, in English and in Korean; and our answer, signed by the Chief, along with a spread on Korea &ndash; the struggle that is going on in the South, the Korean War, the Pueblo incident, and the Flying Pueblo incident.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs5EFED22F">(3) September 9, is the Korean National Day, marking their Victory and Liberation. Due to shortness of time, I will send them a telegram in the name of the Party.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs5EFED22F">(4) Put the North Korean Embassy on the mailing list for our newspaper. I think they have embassies in Mexico and Canada. You should send copies to those embassies, but also send about three copies each time to the Korean Embassy here in Algeria.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs5EFED22F">(5) It is very important that all progressive countries in the world receive copies of our newspaper; also progressive organizations inside those countries. Our Solidarity Comm. In Sweden should be made to deal with a lot of that, also to come up with bread. Until they do that, they are jiving!!!</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">[2]</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">2-2-2</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">David Hilliard</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Chief of Staff</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs5EFED22F">(6) Also, here are copies of telegrams of support that were sent to the Secretary General of the United Nations, U Thant. They should be run in the Black Panther.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs5EFED22F">(7) Chief, do you recall our dissuasion of strengthening the structure of our Central Committee? I suggested that, as rapidly as possible, Huey and Bobby should give up their reaction to the proposal. In terms of insuring the perpetuation of the Black Panther Party in face of the repression, it would be very helpful if our Central Committee and Political Beaureau [sic] were strengthened. I suggest that M the First and Second leaders from each State or Strong &amp; Stable Branch of the Party be designated by Huey to be members of the Central Committee. It should be done by Executive Mandate. I suggest that in the Executive Mandate, the method of selection of Central Committee members be spelled out. Also, I think that in the same Mandate, the members of the Political Bureau should be named. My suggestion for the Political Bureau are (1) Huey, (2) Bobby, (3) David, (4) Emory, (5) Eldridge, (6) </span><span class="csE4EC0D56"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="cs5EFED22F">(7) </span><span class="csE4EC0D56"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="cs5EFED22F"> (8) </span><span class="csE4EC0D56"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="cs5EFED22F"> (9) </span><span class="csE4EC0D56"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="cs5EFED22F"> .</span><span class="csE4EC0D56"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs5EFED22F">(8) David, there is a new little RED BOOK out entitled </span><span class="csE4EC0D56">THE CONSTITUTION OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHINA</span><span class="cs5EFED22F">; it was published this year, and it really hits this subject right on the nose. I think that it would be very helpful to see to it that Huey and Bobby both get a chances [sic] to read this book right away, because it will help to clarify some problems of structure. Let me hear from you regarding this article.</span></p><p class="cs1157FFE2"><span class="cs5EFED22F">All Power to the People</span></p><p class="cs1157FFE2"><span class="cs5EFED22F">___________________</span></p><p class="cs1157FFE2"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Eldridge Cleaver</span></p><p class="cs1157FFE2"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Minister of Information</span></p><p class="cs1157FFE2"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Black Panther Party</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">[3]</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csE4EC0D56">IMPORTANT URGENT IMPORTANT URGENT IMPORTANT URGENT</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">David Hilliard, Chief of Staff of the Black Panther Party, send a telegram to the INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF ANTI-IMPERIALIST JOURNALISTS, Pyongyang, capitol of the Democratic People&rsquo;s Republic of Korea --- showing solidarity and proletarian internationalist spirit of the Black Panther Party. It will very important to do this without fail.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The Conference begins on September 17 and runs to the 28 of September. Suggest that we print an announcement of the Conference in the Black Panther and print the address of the Conference and call upon all revolutionary organizations to also send telegrams to express their solidarity with the fighting Korean people in the face of new aggressions being plotted against the Korean peoples by Imperialists.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">[4]</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csE4EC0D56">IMPORTANT URGENT IMPORTANT URGENT IMPORTANT URGENT</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Here is the text of a telegram message sent by the Koreans, to Babylon.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">1. Translate it and send it to the Party for printing in Black Panther.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">2. See to it that it gets sent around for wide coverage.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">3. The Chief of Staff should send a strong response showing appreciation and expressing solidarity. His telegram will be widely circulated throughout the word by the Koreans, so this is important in helping to mobilize international support.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">4. During these days, it would be on time to run things in the Black Panther about the struggle of the Korean peoples and the increasing plots against them by the imperialists. The Pueblo, the Flying Pueblo, and the Helicopter that was shot down. There is a guerrilla struggle going on right now for the liberation of South Korea from the hands of the pupets [sic] and lackies there.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">For Kathleen: These messages should also be put into the first issue of our magazine RIGHT ON, or ON TIME, whichever we decide to make it. The magazine itself must not be printed until after I get back and have a chance to check it out, plus I will have a lot of good material for the magazine.</span></p></span>
