		<span><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Comrade Chief of Mission,</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">On the attitude of socialist countries regarding the April 6t 1973 letter sent by the DPRK Supreme People&rsquo;s Assembly to all legislatures and executives in the world, we would like to inform you about the following matters:</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs8F481057"><span class="cs566403DE">All socialist countries published various materials to support the measures taken by the DPRK to ensure the withdrawal of American troops from South Korea, the demise of the UN Commission for the Unification and Reconstruction of Korea and the ceasing of all foreign interventions in the internal affairs of Korea.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs746A5FAB"><span class="cs566403DE">European socialist countries display some reserves toward North Korea&rsquo;s assertions on the possibility for the peaceful reunification of the country, given that there are two conflicting socio-economic orders. These reserves stem from the GDR position, the East Germans being worried about a potential resurgence of national unity sentiments in Germany.</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs8F481057" value="2"><span class="cs566403DE">By the end of April, only the PRC, USSR and Romania replied to the letter of the DPRK Supreme People&rsquo;s Assembly.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs746A5FAB"><span class="cs566403DE">With the exception of Yugoslavia, Albania, and Cuba, all other socialist countries stated, directly or indirectly, that they are about to send their written responses to the DPRK Supreme People&rsquo;s Assembly. We picked up hints that European socialist countries, with the exception of Albania, coordinated their position toward the North Korean letter.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Signed:</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Gh.
