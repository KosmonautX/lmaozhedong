Conversely, the DPRK is expecting practical results from its comprehensive international campaign of building contacts.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The new DPRK tactics aims at achieving immediate objectives of unification without South Korea, or even against it.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The continuation of inter-Korean dialogue will therefore retain a formal character, depending mostly on indirect actions and various contingencies.</span></p></span>
