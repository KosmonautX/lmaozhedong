This belief is based on the things mentioned in the speech given by Foreign Minister Ji Pengfei at the February 9th reception, namely that:</span></p><ul start="0" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csF80C54B0" value="0"><span class="cs566403DE">No solution was found to the Korean problem, although 28 years have passed since the end of the Second World War;&nbsp;</span></li></ul>
		<ul start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csF80C54B0"><span class="cs566403DE">The division of the country is one of the main factors generating tensions in Asia;</span></li></ul>
		<ul start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csF80C54B0"><span class="cs566403DE">It is presently very urgently needed to guarantee favorable conditions for the peaceful unification of Korea, without any interference from the outside into internal affairs, which is why it is being requested to withdraw American troops from South Korea, as well as to cease the activity of the so-called UN Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea.</span></li></ul>
		<p class="cs865BD0AF"><span class="cs566403DE">The fact that the Chinese government is linking the relaxation of tensions in Asia, a premise of the Sino-American rapprochement, clearly mentioned in the February 1972 Shanghai Communiqu&eacute;, and the withdrawal of American troops in South Korea, is given a special meaning. </span></p><p class="cs865BD0AF"><span class="cs566403DE">Therefore, it is expected that during Kissinger&rsquo;s talks in Beijing, in case a Kissinger-Heo Dam meeting is impossible, on top of discussing issues related to Indochina, to the Paris conference on Vietnam, as well as to Sino-American relations, the Korean problem will be given a prominent spot, in the sense that [the Chinese will try to] persuade the Americans to accept direct tripartite negotiations so that the process of d&eacute;tente between the two Koreas, and in the Far East in general, is consolidated.</span></p><p class="cs865BD0AF"><span class="cs566403DE">The Chilean ambassador stressed on one of the significant details of the conversation between Kim Il Sung and Foreign Minister Clodomiro Almeyda Medina, namely on the firm decision of the North Korean government to consolidate the process of the large diplomatic opening it started in 1972 through the consistent advancement of a more flexible foreign policy both in its rapports with South Korea as well as towards Japan and the United States. As an immediate premise for the development of d&eacute;tente from Southeast Asia to the entire Far East, Kim Il Sung expressed his desire to abolish the presence of American troops in South Korea, the peaceful unification of the country being conceived as a long-term step-by-step process, without any interference from the outside.</span></p><p class="csD98CF629"><span class="cs566403DE">Signed: N.
