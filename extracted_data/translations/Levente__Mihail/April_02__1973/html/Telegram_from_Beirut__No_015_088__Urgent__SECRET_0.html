			<li class="csCBF31A94"><span class="cs5EFED22F">It feared that after the Sino-American rapprochement and the Soviet-American d&eacute;tente, it would share the fate of Jiang Jieshi [Chiang Kai-shek], who was then abandoned by the Americans;</span></li></ol>
		<ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csCBF31A94"><span class="cs5EFED22F">In the abovementioned conditions the second reason for accepting this dialogue is &ldquo;the inferiority of the South compared to the North in all possible respects&rdquo; and therefore the fear of the South Korean regime of political turbulences in case it had rejected the North Korean opening;</span></li></ol>
		<ol start="3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csCBF31A94"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Finally, at its turn, the United States and Japan exerted a certain pressure on the South Korean regime to accept the proposals of the DPRK to negotiate the unification of the country.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">At my second question regarding &ldquo;the prospects of North-South relations,&rdquo; the DPRK diplomat answered that &ldquo;the South is weak and unable to conquer the North; it wants to gain time by continuing a sterile dialogue; it wants to totally annihilate the adherence of progressive forces to the North&rsquo;s proposals; it wants to consolidate its internal position and then negotiate with the North from a position of strength. The North Korean communists are nonetheless convinced that the political situation in the South will evolve in favor of unification, and that the plan of the South Korean puppets will fail.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Finally, he added that he was mandated by his government to inform me of the matters mentioned above because &ldquo;the South Korean representative to Beirut launched a campaign to visit socialist embassies in Beirut, to spread disinformation&rdquo; and that he was asking me &ldquo;not to listen to their calumnies.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">I assured him that our party and our government had been, was and would be supporting in the future the righteous positions of the DPRK.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Signed: M.
