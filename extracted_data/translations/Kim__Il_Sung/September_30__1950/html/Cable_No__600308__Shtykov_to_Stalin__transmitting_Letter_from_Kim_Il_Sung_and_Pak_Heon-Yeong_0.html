The enemy seized Incheon and is waging street battles right in the city of Seoul.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">A threatening situation has been created. </span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Units of our People&rsquo;s Army are fighting heroically against advancing assault units of the enemy. However, we consider it necessary to report to you about the very unfavorable conditions for us.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Enemy aviation numbering about 1,000 aircraft of different types, completely rule the air without encountering any resistance from our part, and have daily made round-the-clock raids at the fronts and in the rear.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">At the fronts motorized units of the enemy under the protection of hundreds of aircraft maneuver freely, inflicting great losses in manpower and equipment. At the same time enemy aircraft, freely destroying railroads and highways, telegraph and telephone communications, transportation equipment, and other facilities, are interrupting the supply of operational units and pinning down the operations of our troops, making it impossible for the units to make timely maneuvers. We are this difficulty is being experienced on all fronts.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Having cut all the communications of our units and linked up the assault troops which landed in the region of Incheon with the units of the southern front which have broken through our front, the enemy has a real chance of completely occupying the city of Seoul.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">As a result of this units of the People&rsquo;s Army in the southern part of Korea have been cut off from the northern part by the enemy, and also units in South Korea have been smashed into pieces and they can not now receive ammunition, weapons, and food. And what is more, some units cannot communicate with one another, and part are surrounded by enemy forces.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">With the complete occupation of Seoul the enemy obviously will undertake a further offensive on North Korea. Concerning this, we think that if conditions unfavorable to us continue to occur the American aggression will in the final account be successful.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">In order to supply the troops with everything necessary and to feed the front without interruption we need to have appropriate air forces most of all. But we have no trained personnel.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Dear Cde. STALIN! We are fully determined to overcome all the difficulties with which we are faced so that Korea not be a colony or bridgehead of American imperialism. We will fight to the last drop of blood for the independence, democracy, and happiness of our people. Therefore we are taking vigorous measures with all [our] energy to form and train a multitude of new divisions to use the more than 100,000 troops mobilized in South Korea in more favorable operational regions, and to arm all the people in order to be ready for a long war.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">In spite of this, if the enemy does not give [us] time to take the steps we have planned and, making use of our extraordinarily difficult situation, forces offensive operations on North Korea, then we will not be able to stop the enemy with our own forces.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Therefore, dear Iosif Vissarionovich, we cannot fail to ask you for special assistance. In other words, at the moment enemy troops cross the 38</span><sup><span class="cs6D6FB01F">th</span></sup><span class="cs566403DE"> parallel we [will] very much need the direct military assistance from the Soviet Union.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">If this is impossible for some reason then give us aid in the creation of international volunteer units in China and other countries of people&rsquo;s democracy to give military assistance to our fight.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">We request your instructions about our proposals above</span></p><p class="cs2A4A7CB2"><span class="cs566403DE">Sincerely, the CC of the Korean Worker&rsquo;s Party</span></p><p class="cs2A4A7CB2"><span class="cs566403DE">KIM IL SUNG, PAK HEON-YEONG</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">29 September 1950</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Sent by Shcherbakova at 0145 1 October 1940 (26)</span></p></span>
