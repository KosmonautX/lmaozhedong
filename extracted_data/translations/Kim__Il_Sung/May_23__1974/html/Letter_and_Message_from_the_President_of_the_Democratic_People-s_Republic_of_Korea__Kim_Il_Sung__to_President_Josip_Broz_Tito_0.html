the words of Comrade Kim Il Sung addressed to you, Comrade Josip Broz Tito.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Dear Comrade Josip Broz Tito!</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Through Comrade Yang Hyong-sop, a member of the Political Committee and Secretary of the CC of our Party, who took part in the 10</span><sup><span class="cs6D6FB01F">th</span></sup><span class="cs566403DE"> Congress of your Party at the invitation of the CC of your Party, I want to tell you of the new measures recently taken by our Party and government on the question of the reunification of Korea, and also about the position of our Party associated with the Third World and the Non-Aligned Movement.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">First I would like to briefly touch on our proposal about the conclusion of a peace agreement with the US.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">As you probably already know, in March of this year at the fifth convocation of the 3</span><sup><span class="cs6D6FB01F">rd</span></sup><span class="cs566403DE"> session of the Supreme People&rsquo;s Assembly we decided to hold talks with the US in order to conclude a peace agreement and sent a letter about this to the US Congress.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Now in order to eliminate the tension in Korea and speed up the peaceful reunification of the country it is first of all necessary to eliminate the state of military confrontation between the North and South and replace the Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">However, the whole course of the dialogue between the North and South shows that the south Korean rulers do not want a reunification of the country and do not intend to eliminate the military confrontation between the North and South or to conclude a peace agreement. In trying to consolidate the current situation of a division of the country into North and South and manufacture &ldquo;two Koreas&rdquo; they, on the one hand, are increasing the fascist repression of the south Korean population and, on the other, are feverishly making new military preparations against the northern part of the Republic.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Such criminal actions of the south Korean puppets are being made under the active instigation of the United States. The US continues to give the south Korean rulers weapons and military equipment, they are expanding military bases in south Korea, and continually conduct military exercises together with the south Korean puppets.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Without the elimination of the US interference in the internal affairs of Korea it is impossible to achieve either a durable peace in Korea or the independent peaceful reunification of our Motherland.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">However, the south Korea rulers not only have no intention of removing outside forces but they also are completely unable to do this.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">As the whole world knows, the right to command the south Korean army does not belong to the south Korea rulers but to the Commanding General of US troops, who is there under the name of &ldquo;the Commanding General of UN Forces&rdquo;, and it is the American troops deployed in south Korean who have the right to command the various weapons and military equipment. </span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">It is clear that in these circumstances it is impossible to decide either the question of the elimination of tension and the securing of peace in Korea with the south Korea rulers or any other question connected with the reunification of the Motherland. </span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">That is why we want to hold talks directly with the US, which has the actual right to decide the question of the replacement of the armistice agreement with a peace agreement and which is one of the actual interested parties which signed the Armistice Agreement in Korea; thus, to achieve the withdrawal of American forces from south Korea and to create preconditions for the solution of the question of the reunification of our Motherland with the efforts of the Koreans themselves.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">We have proposed including the following in a peace agreement which would be concluded with the US: both parties are commit themselves not to attack one another; the US will commit itself to neither protect or incite the south Korean rulers, and not obstruct the peaceful reunification of Korea; both parties should stop building up [their] armed forces and the arms race; foreign troops there under the label of &ldquo;UN forces&rdquo; should be withdrawn from south Korea, and Korea will not become a military or operational base for any other country after the withdrawal of the foreign troops.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">In the final account, the peace agreement which we advocate is directed at the liquidation of a constant hotbed of war in Korea and the elimination of outside forces, the main obstacle to the reunification of our country.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">We unalterably insist that in no event can the question of the reunification of our country be decided if we hand it over to bargaining between the great powers.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">A direct approach to the US with a proposal to hold talks will give us the opportunity and more strongly take the initiative in our hands on the question of the reunification of our country.<br><br>If the US authorities have no intention of pursuing a policy of division and war then they cannot have any excuse or reason for not agreeing to hold direct talks on the question of the conclusion of a peace agreement.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">In our opinion, our proposal about holding direct talks with the US will also be productive for exposing to the entire world that the south Korean rules are traitors to the Motherland and puppets without any real power, which will further isolate then in the international arena.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">At the present time the south Korean rules are very worried that the US will enter into talks with us without taking them into consideration, and are shrewdly trying to obstruct this in every possible way.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">We think that if the US does not continue to support such a bastard as Park Chung-hee, rejected by the people as an inveterate fascist unprecedented in the history of the East or West, and enters into talks with us without delay, then a new way out of Korea will open for the US itself without shame.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">It is a matter of whether the US will make changes to its policy with regard to Korea or not.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">If, as before, the US relies on such a person as Park Chung Hee to pursue the goal of perpetuating national division and the fabrication of &ldquo;two Koreas&rdquo; and preserving the colonial fascist dominance, then the people of south Korea will not just view this indifferently.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">When the south Korean people rise up in revolt and ask us for help, then we will not be able to sit with folded arms. The struggle of the south Korean people is a just struggle for freedom and liberation, and our active support of their revolutionary struggle is a proper national duty.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">In such an event it appears that such a danger is not excluded of the US again being drawn into such events in Korea as occurred in Vietnam.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">We think that before such a turn of events that the US should abandon the aggressive policy with respect to Korea and enter into dialog with us beforehand, which would also completely meet the interests of the American people, who oppose war and love peace.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">I would like to express my confidence that you, Comrade Josip Broz Tito, will put pressure on the US and make use of your influence to mobilize world public opinion to implement our even-handed proposal to hold direct talks with the US.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Further, I would like to express some considerations with respect to increasing the strength of the peoples of the Third World.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Today the peoples of the world are taking the course of independence, which has become an invincible trend of the time.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">In particular, the peoples of the Third World, who in the past were subjected to exploitation and oppression from the imperialists, have strongly taken their fates in their own hands and are acting as the masters in a historic arena. We think that today the countries of the Third World are the main strength of the world revolution.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">But some powers nevertheless do not see the changed reality and, striving to continue dominance of the world, are trying to manage the fates of the countries of the Third World.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">We think the countries of the Third World need to even further strengthen solidarity under the banner of independence in order to be saved from dominance and control from outside.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">In fact, the Third World comprises a large number of countries and population, has a broad territory and many natural resources, and therefore we think the Third World can accomplish anything and restrain any great power if only they unite.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">When the countries of the Third World rationally mobilize in unity and use their potential then, in our opinion, they would make the anti-imperialist forces several times stronger and exert an ever more decisive influence on the development of the international situation.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">The UN General Assembly session held recently on the question of raw materials and development convincingly demonstrated the united power of the peoples of the Third World who are fighting for independent development. </span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">We insist that the peoples of the countries of the Third World ought to firmly band together to ensure a durable peace in the entire world and the security of humanity, break up the old procedure of international relations established in the interests of the great powers, and affirm a new way of international relations meeting the interests of the peoples of the Third World.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">We think that it is important not only to strengthen the unity and cohesion of the peoples of the countries of the Third World, but to also free such countries of the Second World as France, Japan, Canada, and others, which are subjected to their pressure from the influence of the great powers so that they do not blindly follow these powers.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">It is true that France, Japan, Canada, and the other countries of the Second World have relations of alliance with the US and common positions with it, but on a number of questions their interests are not identical.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">In addition, these countries do not have sufficient natural resources, so that they rely on the rich resources of the countries of the Third World for the development of the economies of their countries. Although they assert that the developing countries cannot live without their &ldquo;help&rdquo;, in fact they are not able to live without the fuel and raw materials of the countries of the Third World. The energy crisis, which enveloped the capitalist world as a result of the vigorous measures of the Arab countries adopted in connection with the war in the Middle East in October of last year, eloquently tells of this.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">If the countries of the Third World make skillful use of such adversarial relations between the powers and their weaknesses then, in our opinion, they could win over the countries of the Second World and form a united front with them.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">As it seems to us, if the countries of the Third World increase their solidarity, enlist the countries of the Second World, and wage a skillful struggle, then they could also have the final word in the United Nations. In such an event the United Nations itself could be turned into a genuine organization of peace and progress serving the interests of the peoples of the Third World, and make such an arena of the superpowers like the Security Council correspondingly inoperative, and wreck the attempts of some of the big countries to turn the UN into their plaything.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">We think that if the struggle continues in such a direction then in the future a new organization like the UN headed by the countries of the Third World might be created independent of the existing UN.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">In our opinion, the possibility is not excluded of convening a conference of newborn forces of the Third World at an appropriate time in order to organize and develop such a movement.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">You, Comrade Josip Broz Tito, as one of the generally-recognized eminent leaders of the Third World, have truly done much in the name of the unity and independence of the peoples of the Third World. We hope that in the future you will make a great contribution to this noble cause.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Further, I would like to dwell on the question of the participation of the Democratic People&rsquo;s Republic of Korea in the Non-Aligned Movement to make an active contribution to strengthening the solidarity of the Third World and the further development of the world revolutionary movement.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">We have always devoted deep attention to the Non-Aligned Movement and highly appreciate its anti-militaristic, peace-loving, and progressive role.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">The Non-Aligned Movement, directed against all forms of aggression, enslavement, and inequality, plays an important role in strengthening the unity and solidarity of the anti-imperialist forces, including the countries of the Third World, and is making a great contribution at the present time to the development of &nbsp;the world revolutionary movement. </span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">And our country, as a country belonging to the Third World, desires to join the ranks of the Non-Aligned Countries if they do not object to this.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Inasmuch as there is a good precedent, that although Yugoslavia is a socialist country, but at the same time as a country belonging to the Third World, it plays a great role in the ranks of the nonaligned countries, and we think we could join the ranks of the nonaligned countries and pursue our activity among them.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">True, here we have other problems unlike Yugoslavia.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">This is conditioned by the fact that our country has bilateral military alliances with other socialist countries. But this is essentially unlike the fact that others are members of such a multilateral military bloc as the Warsaw Pact. In addition, we have no foreign military bases in the country.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Inasmuch as we are actively fighting against imperialism, colonialism, and for independence, in our opinion this is in our opinion a problem which can be overcome and does not serve as a great hindrance to our participation in the Non-Aligned Movement.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">We are not forgetting that in the past year you, Comrade Josip Broz Tito, have applied every sincere effort to invite us to take part as an observer at the highest level in the 4</span><sup><span class="cs6D6FB01F">th</span></sup><span class="cs566403DE"> Conference of Non-Aligned Countries in Algiers.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">You are one of the founders of the Non-Aligned Movement and have many years of rich experience in the development of this movement, and therefore I think that you could give us great help in this question.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Here I have finished passing you the words of Comrade Kim Il Sung.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">We would be very grateful to you if you would express your valuable opinions on these questions.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">I thank you for the attention.</span></p></span>
