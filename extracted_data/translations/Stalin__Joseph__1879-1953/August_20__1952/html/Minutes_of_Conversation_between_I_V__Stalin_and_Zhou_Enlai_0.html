We must also thank the Chinese people for carrying on the right struggle. China also helps us by delivering us caoutchouc [natural rubber]. Thus, we will have to thank China as well.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Zhou Enlai</span><span class="cs566403DE"> says that, unfortunately, China&#39;s assistance to Soviet Union is insufficient.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Stalin</span><span class="cs566403DE">. You came to power too late. You were late by more than 30 years.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Zhou Enlai</span><span class="cs566403DE"> asks for permission to set forth the reason for the delegation&#39;s visit. Refers to the telegram from Mao Zedong which contains the Chinese government&#39;s wishes. States three main topics to be discussed. First question - the situation in Korea. Second - the internal situation within PRC over the past three years and the five year plan for economic development. Notes that a written report is under preparation. The Chinese delegation would like to deal with this question after the report has been presented. Third - the extension of the agreement on Port Arthur.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Stalin</span><span class="cs566403DE"> notes that the initiative to extend the joint use of the military naval base at Port Arthur must come from China.

But that would be a complicated and difficult construction project. The Chinese government is intent on first building a railroad to Mongolia which could then connect to Soviet Union. The length of this railroad on Chinese territory would be approximately 350 km. This railroad is projected to be completed by June 1955. Such a railroad serves Chinese interests as it opens a means of direct rail communication with Soviet Union and eases the receipt of industrial equipment from the USSR to China and the export of Chinese goods to Soviet Union. </span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Stalin</span><span class="cs566403DE"> responds that a railway to Xinjiang is very important in the long term, and that we could help China build this railway. But this is indeed a long project. If the Chinese comrades are interested in building a railway across Mongolia, we are ready to help in its construction within Mongolian territory. This would be quicker. However, we believe that one cannot lose sight of a Xinjiang railway, since this would be a very important railway which would pass through regions rich in oil. There should be oil there. Mongolia doesn&#39;t have much of it. </span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Zhou Enlai</span><span class="cs566403DE"> notes that there are large deposits of iron ore in the Pinditsiuan region, and that it will become the center of the railroad and steel industries. Right now a plan for the construction of the Xinjiang railway is being drafted. In the course of the first five year plan a railway will be constructed from Lanzhou to Khami. In the second five-year plan a railroad will be built from Khami to the USSR border.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Stalin</span><span class="cs566403DE"> approves of this and reiterates the significance of a Xinjiang railway with respect to prospective oil mining.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Zhou Enlai</span><span class="cs566403DE"> affirms that there are oil deposits all along this route.

Says that a written report on the subject is under preparation and that, as soon as the report is completed, he would like to visit comrade Stalin and personally go over the report with him.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Stalin</span><span class="cs566403DE"> agrees to this.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Zhou Enlai</span><span class="cs566403DE"> requests assistance for work in geological exploration.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Stalin</span><span class="cs566403DE"> promises such assistance.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Zhou Enlai</span><span class="cs566403DE"> shifts to the question of construction projects for various industrial enterprises in China. Says that there are 151 such enterprises planned to be constructed. Points out that China needs the Soviet Union&#39;s help in procuring equipment. Asks that the PRC&#39;s written request be considered and that an answer be given as to whether and in what capacity the Soviet Union would render such assistance, and that time periods be specified, and also that Soviet specialists be sent to China. Emphasizes that Soviet specialists working in China have performed a great deal of work and have been of great help to China, especially in the area of training work cadres and specialists. </span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Stalin</span><span class="cs566403DE">. That is most important. China must have its own cadres in order to stand strong on its own feet.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Zhou Enlai</span><span class="cs566403DE"> informs that they would like to receive an additional 800 specialists from Soviet Union. </span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Stalin</span><span class="cs566403DE"> says that this request will be examined and that we will try to send as many as we can.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Zhou Enlai</span><span class="cs566403DE"> asks also for assistance with technical documentation (blueprints, etc.).</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Stalin</span><span class="cs566403DE"> answers that this is, indeed, necessary.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Zhou Enlai</span><span class="cs566403DE"> asks if it will be possible to continue to educate students in the USSR and to send interns to Soviet enterprises. </span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Stalin</span><span class="cs566403DE"> expresses agreement.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Zhou Enlai</span><span class="cs566403DE"> touches on the question of the military five year plan. Informs that materials are under preparation and that a written report will be presented. Also wishes to receive military equipment.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Stalin</span><span class="cs566403DE"> asks what Zhou Enlai has in mind: shipments of weapons or equipment for military factories.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Zhou Enlai</span><span class="cs566403DE"> says that he meant shipments of weapons. Noting that since agreement has already been expressed with regard to weapons for 60 divisions, he would like to discuss shipments for naval forces. Asks what sort of assistance could be received in the way of airplanes.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Stalin</span><span class="cs566403DE"> asks whether the Chinese government is thinking of building aero-manufacturing plants.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Zhou Enlai</span><span class="cs566403DE"> says that this would be very difficult to do in the course of the first five year plan, particularly with regard to jet airplanes. Notes that such construction is not planned to begin until at least 5 years from now, and motor-building - in 3 years.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Stalin</span><span class="cs566403DE"> points to the example of Czechoslovakia and Poland, which began with assembly plants. Says that the USSR could send China motors and other airplane parts, and China could organize the assembly of these airplanes. Cadres can be trained in this way. We went through the same process. Such a process would be more beneficial for Chinese comrades as well. First you must build 1-2 factories for motor assembly. We will send motors and other airplane parts which would then be assembled in China. That&#39;s how it was done in Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary. This ought to be organized. Having organized assembly plants, you could then, in another 3 years, build an airplane factory. That is the easiest and the best way.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Zhou Enlai</span><span class="cs566403DE"> says that they are beginning to understand this and are organizing maintenance and assembly plants. He adds that if comrade Stalin finds it necessary to hasten the process, then they will take all appropriate measures to comply.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Stalin</span><span class="cs566403DE"> asks whether divisions of some sort have been organized in order to receive the shipment of weapons for 60 divisions which Soviet Union sent to China. </span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Zhou Enlai</span><span class="cs566403DE"> explains that out of the 10 divisions&#39; worth of armaments that China has received, 3 have been given over to Korea and 7 have been earmarked for Chinese detachments in Korea.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Stalin</span><span class="cs566403DE"> asks if he understands correctly that all of the weapons will go to the Korean front. </span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Zhou Enlai</span><span class="cs566403DE"> affirms that it will be so, assuming that the war will continue. Informs that, out of the total of 60 divisions&#39; armaments, the Chinese government is intent on sending 3 to Korea, preparing 42 divisions [of Chinese soldiers] to serve in Korea ..... [ellipsis in original]</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Stalin</span><span class="cs566403DE"> asks whether the Chinese have gotten used to the new weapons.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Zhou Enlai</span><span class="cs566403DE"> explains that they are gradually becoming proficient with the new weapons, with 3-4 months of training.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Stalin</span><span class="cs566403DE">. Under these circumstances we operate in a way so as to allow soldiers to become familiar with the weapons and the overall organization of the division. This takes time - approximately 6 months. Without it one could lose the weapons. Besides, during this time we inspect the operation of various mechanisms, and only then do we send these units to the front. Of course this preparation could be carried out behind the front, in Korea, for example. Half of the divisions receiving the new weapons should remain in China.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Zhou Enlai</span><span class="cs566403DE"> notes that the shipment of divisions to Korea results in losses, which must be made up. </span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Stalin</span><span class="cs566403DE"> emphasizes that it is imperative to train the divisions, so as to make them stronger.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Zhou Enlai</span><span class="cs566403DE"> raises the question of assistance with artillery.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Stalin</span><span class="cs566403DE"> asks whether China can produce ammunition.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Zhou Enlai</span><span class="cs566403DE"> answers that they have not yet addressed this question.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Stalin</span><span class="cs566403DE"> notes that, all in all, it is more difficult to transport ammunition than artillery pieces.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Zhou Enlai</span><span class="cs566403DE"> repeats his request for assistance with artillery. Emphasizes that for every Chinese shell fired, the Americans answer with 9 shells of their own. </span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Stalin</span><span class="cs566403DE">. That&#39;s bad. Adds that if the Americans are firing 9 shells, the Chinese should be firing 20. We smothered the Germans with artillery. We had a gun stationed every 2 meters, while the Germans had a gun every kilometer. Artillery is important stuff. The Chinese government needs to get the munitions production going. We will help you build these factories.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Zhou Enlai</span><span class="cs566403DE"> points out that they are reorganizing existing factories and are planning new factories.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Stalin</span><span class="cs566403DE">. That is necessary. Machine tools are of utmost importance here.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Zhou Enlai</span><span class="cs566403DE"> says that they have machine tools, but old ones.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Stalin</span><span class="cs566403DE"> says that machine tools are essential in the production of ammunition for 122mm, three-inch and anti-aircraft guns. We can help in this matter. Adds that it is not necessary to build large factories. We build ammunition in different plants: one plant makes shell casings while another loads them. It&#39;s difficult to do everything in one factory.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Zhou Enlai</span><span class="cs566403DE"> announces that the Chinese government will act upon the advice of the Soviet government regarding its aviation industry and take all measures to further its development. </span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Stalin</span><span class="cs566403DE"> emphasizes the importance of first organizing assembly plants.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Zhou Enlai</span><span class="cs566403DE"> says that the Chinese government plans to build tank-producing factories: one for light tanks with an output of 1 thousand tanks per year, and another for medium tanks, to be completed in 4-5 years.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Stalin</span><span class="cs566403DE"> advises to start here with assembly plans as well, pointing out that during the war we converted automobile factories to produce tanks.

He points out that up until May 1951 the war in Korea was not static, but was a war of movement. Since May 1951, a front has been established, and the war has become static. Both sides are about equal in strength. The enemy is in no position to carry out an offensive. There is a certain equilibrium. But we are not carrying out large offensives, either. Like the enemy which has reinforced its position 15-20 km. deep, so have we created our own fortified zone, and continue to dig even now. The enemy has not been able to destroy our fortifications. The front line extends for about 200 km and is completely fortified, as are the left and right flanks. </span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Mao Zedong has put forth three questions. First - will we be able to repulse the enemy? We are convinced that we will. Second - will we be able to hold our present positions? This year has shown that we will be able to hold and strengthen our positions. Third - will we be able to carry out an offensive, to attack the enemy? Earlier we thought that we would hardly be able to carry out an offensive for more than 7 days. Now we are sufficiently strong to launch longer offensives and have entrenched ourselves well enough to withstand bombing raids.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Stalin</span><span class="cs566403DE"> asks whether they are capable of widening the scope of the offensives.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Zhou Enlai</span><span class="cs566403DE"> explains that they can launch offensives to capture isolated positions, but a general offensive would be difficult to carry out. Since the war acquired its static nature, the American command has been intent on drawing out the negotiations and is not interested in signing a truce.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Stalin</span><span class="cs566403DE"> says that apparently the Americans want to keep more Chinese POWs. That would explain their refusal to return POWs. Perhaps they turned them over to Chiang Kai-shek [Jiang Jieshi].</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Zhou Enlai</span><span class="cs566403DE"> affirms that there are agents of Chiang Kai-shek among the POWs.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Stalin</span><span class="cs566403DE"> observes that Americans want to decide the POW question on their own, in defiance of all international laws. Under international law the warring sides are obligated to return all POWs, except those convicted of crimes. What does Mao Zedong think regarding this matter: will he give in or will he hold his own?</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Zhou Enlai</span><span class="cs566403DE"> briefly relates the differences that separate them and the [North] Korean comrades in this matter. America has agreed to return 83 thousand POWs, and [North] Korea was ready to accept the offer. However, they have not considered the crafty game that America is playing here - out of the 83 thousand, only 6400 are Chinese, and the rest Koreans. In truth, they are supposed to return another 13,600 Chinese volunteers, but the Americans don&#39;t want to do this, though they are quite willing to return 76 thousand Koreans. This clearly shows that they are out to provoke us, by trying to drive a wedge between China and [North] Korea.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Stalin</span><span class="cs566403DE"> asks how many Korean POWs are there.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Zhou Enlai</span><span class="cs566403DE"> answers - 96,600. Emphasizes that the question of the number of Chinese and Korean POWs supposed to be returned is a matter of principle. Informs that the Chinese government is firmly committed on having all 116 thous. POWs, including 20 thous. Chinese, returned. But if Americans were to agree on returning a few less, then we would not strongly object, if [they] promised that negotiations for the return of the other POWs will continue. </span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Stalin</span><span class="cs566403DE"> affirms that this is the right position.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Zhou Enlai</span><span class="cs566403DE"> informs that Mao Zedong, having analyzed the current situation regarding this matter, believes that one should stand firmly committed on the return of all POWs. The [North] Koreans believe that the continuation of the war is not advantageous because the daily losses are greater than the number of POWs whose return is being discussed. But ending the war would not be advantageous to the USA. Mao Zedong believes that the continuation of the war is advantageous to us, since it detracts USA from preparing for a new world war. </span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Stalin</span><span class="cs566403DE">. Mao Zedong is right. This war is getting on America&#39;s nerves. The North Koreans have lost nothing, except for casualties that they suffered during the war. Americans understand that this war is not advantageous and they will have to end it, especially after it becomes clear that our troops will remain in China. Endurance and patience is needed here. Of course, one needs to understand Korea - they have suffered many casualties. But they need to be explained that this is an important matter. They need patience and lots of endurance. The war in Korea has shown America&#39;s weakness. The armies of 24 countries cannot continue the war in Korea for long, since they have not achieved their goals and cannot count on success in this matter. Koreans need our help and support.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Asks about the bread situation in Korea. Says that we can help them.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Zhou Enlai</span><span class="cs566403DE"> says that Korea is having difficulties in this regard. The Chinese government knows that USSR has helped Korea. Says that they have also helped Korea and have told Kim Il Sung that this is not an obstacle, that they will give them foodstuffs and clothing and everything they ask for, but that they cannot give weapons. </span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Stalin</span><span class="cs566403DE"> says that we can give Korea additional weapons. We will begrudge nothing to Korea.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Zhou Enlai</span><span class="cs566403DE"> repeats that they cannot yield to the Americans during the negotiations.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Stalin</span><span class="cs566403DE"> observes that if the Americans back down a little, then you can accept, assuming that negotiations will continue on questions still unresolved.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Zhou Enlai</span><span class="cs566403DE"> agrees, adding that if the Americans don&#39;t want peace, then we must be prepared to continue the war, even if it were to take another year.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Stalin</span><span class="cs566403DE"> affirms that this is correct.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Zhou Enlai</span><span class="cs566403DE"> emphasizes the truth of comrade Stalin&#39;s observations, namely that this war is getting on America&#39;s nerves and that the USA is not ready for the world war. Adds that China, by playing the vanguard role in this war, is helping to stave off the war for 15-20 years, assuming that they will succeed in containing the American offensive in Korea. Then the USA will not be able to unleash a third world war at all. </span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Stalin</span><span class="cs566403DE"> says that this is true, but with one stipulation: Americans are not capable of waging a large-scale war at all, especially after the Korean war. All of their strength lies in air power and the atom bomb. Britain won&#39;t fight for America. America cannot defeat little Korea. One must be firm when dealing with America. The Chinese comrades must know that if America does not lose this war, then China will never recapture Taiwan. Americans are merchants. Every American soldier is a speculator, occupied with buying and selling. Germans conquered France in 20 days. It&#39;s been already two years, and USA has still not subdued little Korea. What kind of strength is that? America&#39;s primary weapons, says comrade Stalin jokingly, are stockings, cigarettes, and other merchandise. They want to subjugate the world, yet they cannot subdue little Korea. No, Americans don&#39;t know how to fight. After the Korean war, in particular, they have lost the capability to wage a large-scale war. They are pinning their hopes on the atom bomb and air power. But one cannot win a war with that. One needs infantry, and they don&#39;t have much infantry; the infantry they do have is weak. They are fighting with little Korea, and already people are weeping in the USA. What will happen if they start a large-scale war? Then, perhaps, everyone will weep. </span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Zhou Enlai</span><span class="cs566403DE"> states that if America makes some sort of compromises, even if they are small, then they should accept. If America does not agree to return all POWs and proposes a smaller number, then they should accept the offer, under the condition that the question of the remaining POWs will be resolved under mediation by some neutral country, like India, or the remaining POWs transferred to this neutral country until the question is resolved. </span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Stalin</span><span class="cs566403DE"> asks how many American POWs there are.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Zhou Enlai</span><span class="cs566403DE"> explains that the overall number of POWs in North Korean and Chinese hands is 12,000, out of which 7,400 are South Koreans. </span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Stalin</span><span class="cs566403DE"> does not exclude such a resolution to the question, as proposed by Zhou Enlai. On his part, [he] proposes that they could announce to the Americans that if they are holding back a certain percentage of Korean and Chinese POWs, then North Korea and China will hold back the same percentage of South Korean and American POWs until a final solution to the POW question is agreed upon. This needs to be tried as a way of pressuring Americans by publicizing it in the press. If America rejects this offer, then it should be declared that they apparently want to send Chinese POWs to Chiang Kai-shek. If these proposals are unsuccessful, then you can resort to mediation. The main thing here is to propose a ceasefire.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Zhou Enlai</span><span class="cs566403DE"> declares that, indeed, an armistice agreement also involves a cease-fire. On the POW question [he] enumerates three positions. First - announce from the beginning that they will hold back the same percentage of South Korean and American POWs as the percentage of North Koreans and Chinese held back by America, and leave it at that. Second - resort to mediation by a neutral country. Third - sign an armistice agreement by putting off the POW question and resuming its discussion afterwards.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Then Zhou Enlai returned to the question of military assistance and put forth the Korean comrades&#39; request for 10 anti-aircraft gun regiments. We told the Koreans that we don&#39;t have such capabilities, but that we would bring this up with the Soviet government. </span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Stalin</span><span class="cs566403DE">. Kim Il Sung asked as for 5 regiments. We promised to send him these. Perhaps China will also give 5 regiments?</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Zhou Enlai</span><span class="cs566403DE"> repeats that they do not have such capabilities and that this is new to them.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Stalin</span><span class="cs566403DE"> says that this question needs to be cleared up with Kim Il Sung.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">As for Zhou Enlai&#39;s request to send 10 regiments, irrespective of those promised earlier, comrade Stalin answers that it will have to be examined.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Zhou Enlai</span><span class="cs566403DE"> brings up the Korean comrades&#39; request for advice on whether they should start bombing South Korea. They are not sure whether it&#39;s the right way to go.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Stalin</span><span class="cs566403DE"> explains that the air force belongs to the state and that Chinese volunteers should not use state planes.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Zhou Enlai</span><span class="cs566403DE"> informs that the Korean comrades have asked about launching a new offensive, to which the Chinese government replied that they cannot carry out a strategic offensive.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Stalin</span><span class="cs566403DE"> points out that when armistice negotiations are taking place, they should not be launching either strategic or tactical offensives. They shouldn&#39;t be launching any offensives.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Zhou Enlai</span><span class="cs566403DE"> asks, referring to Mao Zedong&#39;s question whether Kim Il Sung and [Chinese military commander] Peng Dehuai should be invited to Moscow.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Stalin</span><span class="cs566403DE">. I would happily talk to them, but they are far away. Besides, we are not very comfortable with inviting them. If they were to bring up the question, then we would happily welcome them here.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Zhou Enlai</span><span class="cs566403DE"> informs that Peng Dehuai would very much like to come, though he is unsure of what Kim Il Sung thinks. Perhaps it would be good to speak to them about this.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Stalin</span><span class="cs566403DE"> agrees.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Zhou Enlai</span><span class="cs566403DE"> repeats that the Chinese government believes that it is wise to continue the negotiations in Panmunjom. But China is preparing for the possibility of another 2-3 years of war. Again asks for assistance with aviation, artillery, and ammunition, as China cannot deal with these matters on its own. </span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Stalin</span><span class="cs566403DE"> announces that everything we can give you, we will. </span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Asks how is the Korean morale. Is there confusion?</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Zhou Enlai</span><span class="cs566403DE"> explains that, indeed, there has been much destruction in Korea, especially after the bombing of the electric power station on the Yalu river. This has had an impact on Korean morale and on their efforts to accelerate the struggle to achieve peace.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Stalin</span><span class="cs566403DE"> says that the American strategy is fright. But they have not frightened China. Could it be said that they have also failed to frighten Korea?</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Zhou Enlai</span><span class="cs566403DE"> affirms that one could essentially say that.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Stalin</span><span class="cs566403DE">. If that is true, then it&#39;s not too bad.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Zhou Enlai</span><span class="cs566403DE"> adds that Korea is wavering somewhat.
