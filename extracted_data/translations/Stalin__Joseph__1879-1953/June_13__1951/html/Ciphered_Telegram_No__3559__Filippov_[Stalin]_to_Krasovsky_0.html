You and General Belov apparently intend to make professors rather than battle pilots out of the Chinese pilots. We consider this to be overcautiousness on the side of our aviation specialists. If Russian pilots were trained during the war in five to six months, then why is it impossible to complete the training of Chinese pilots in seven to eight months? Isn&#39;t it time to throw away this harmful overcautiousness? The Chinese troops will not fight without air cover. Therefore it is necessary to create more quickly a group of eight Chinese air fighter divisions and send them to the front. This is now your main task.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Belov can send one division closer to the Chinese border in Manchuria, and two divisions can be held in the rear in North Korea, thus freeing up two airports for the Chinese fighter divisions closer to the front. This is absolutely necessary. It is necessary to arrange matters so that the Chinese rely only on their own aviation at the front.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Report the fulfillment.</span></p><p class="cs2A4A7CB2"><span class="cs566403DE">FILIPPOV [Stalin]</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">No. 303/sh</span></p></span>
