    <p>CIPHERED TELEGRAM <br/>BEIJING - SOVIET AMBASSADOR<br/><br/>To transmit to Comrade MAO ZEDONG<br/><br/>Comrade MAO ZEDONG!<br/><br/>I received your telegram No. 3153.<br/><br/>I thank you for the information about the state of affairs in China, in connection with  the successful offensive of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in Korea.<br/><br/>Your successes gladden not only me and my comrades in the leadership, but also all Soviet people. Allow me to greet from the soul you and your friends in the leadership, the People's Liberation Army of China and the entire Chinese people in connection with these enormous successes in their struggle against the American troops.<br/><br/>I have no doubt that in the war against the up-to-date and well-armed American army the Chinese army will receive great experience in contemporary warfare and will turn itself into a fully up-to-date, well-armed, formidable army, just as the Soviet Army in the struggle with the first-class-armed German army received experience in contemporary warfare and turned into an up-to-date well-equipped army.<br/><br/>I wish you further successes.<br/><br/>FILIPPOV [Stalin]<br/>1 December 1950</p>  </body>
