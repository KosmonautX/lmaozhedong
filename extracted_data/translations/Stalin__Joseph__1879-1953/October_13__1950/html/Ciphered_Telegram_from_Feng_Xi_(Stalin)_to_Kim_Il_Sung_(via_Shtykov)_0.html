I am awaiting detailed reports about this matter from Mao Zedong. In connection with this new decision of the Chinese comrades, I ask you to postpone temporarily the implementation of the telegram sent to you yesterday about the evacuation of North Korea and the retreat of the Korean troops to the north.<br><br>Feng Xi [STALIN]<br><br>13 Oct 1950<br>[typed:] Sent on 13.X.50</span></p></span>
