This communication must be signed by the Command of the Korean People&#39;s Army and the command of the Chinese volunteer units, consequently by Comrade KIM IL SUNG and Comrade PENG DEHUAI. If there is no signature of the commander of the Chinese volunteer units, then the Americans will not attach any significance to only one Korean signature. It is necessary decisively to refuse the Danish hospital ship in the area of Wonsan as a place of meeting. It is necessary to demand that the meeting take place at the 38th parallel in the region of Gaeseong [Kaesong]. Keep in mind that at the present time you are the bosses of the affair of an armistice and the Americans will be forced to make concessions on the question of a place for the meeting.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Send to Ridgway today an answer roughly like this:</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">&ldquo;To the commander of UN troops General RIDGWAY. Your statement of 28 June regarding an armistice has been received. We are authorized to declare to you that we agree to a meeting with your representatives for negotiations about a cessation of military actions and the establishment of an armistice. We propose as a meeting place the 38th parallel in the area of the city of Gaesong. If you agree, our representatives will be prepared to meet with your representatives July 10-15.</span></p><p class="cs2A4A7CB2"><span class="cs566403DE">Commander in Chief of the Korean People&#39;s Army</span></p><p class="cs2A4A7CB2"><span class="cs566403DE">KIM IL SUNG</span></p><p class="cs2A4A7CB2"><span class="cs566403DE">Commander in Chief of the Chinese Volunteer Units</span></p><p class="cs2A4A7CB2"><span class="cs566403DE">PENG DEHUAI</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE"><br>Date.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">In your telegram you propose that we direct the negotiations about an armistice from Moscow. This, of course, is inconceivable and not necessary. It&#39;s up to you to lead, Comrade MAO ZEDONG. The most we can give is advice on various questions. We also cannot maintain direct communication with KIM IL SUNG. You must maintain communication [with him].</span></p><p class="cs7C1F8B9D"><span class="cs566403DE">FILIPPOV [Stalin]</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">30 June 1951</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">No. 335/III</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">[...]</span></p></span>
