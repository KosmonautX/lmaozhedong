It is therefore necessary in the course of one and a half to two months to retrain the 6th, 12th and 14th fighter divisions, which are armed with MIG- 9s, on MIG-15s, with a calculation of sending them to the front in September 1951.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">The government of the Chinese People&#39;s Republic asks you to give an order to the Soviet comrades in China to retrain the 6th, 12th and 14th fighter divisions on MIG-15s in the indicated periods.&rdquo; As is obvious, Mao Zedong does not want to take MIG-9s from the Chinese airports for transfer to the front, but prefers to leave them in place, and to use at the front only MIG-15 divisions. Speak with Mao Zedong, and if our supposition is confirmed, tell him that your people will begin the retraining of Chinese pilots now flying MIG-9s for flights on MIG-15s. It seems to us that this does not require two months, but if the Chinese insist, then train them in the course of two months. Report the fulfillment.</span></p><p class="cs2A4A7CB2"><span class="cs566403DE">FILIPPOV [Stalin]</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">26 June 1951</span></p></span>
