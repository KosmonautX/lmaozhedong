Kiselev for his attack against the Nationalist Chinese [representative] in the first committee on the Korean issue. It was unquestionably necessary to make a detailed reply with regard to the high-handed gentleman from the bloc of the imperialist camp. Cde. Kiselev did this, and it is very good that he decided to do this. It is not at all necessary that all members of our delegation sing the same tune about all minor issues. &quot;Extremists&quot; are also needed.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Please convey my opinion to Cde.
