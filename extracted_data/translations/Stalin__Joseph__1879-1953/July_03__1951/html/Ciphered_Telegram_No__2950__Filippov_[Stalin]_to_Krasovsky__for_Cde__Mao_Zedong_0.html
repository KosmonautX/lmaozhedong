With regard to the first two points of your proposal, we have no objections. It is possible to delete the second part of the third point, but if the Americans advance such a proposal, it can be accepted. The fourth point should not be advanced. But if the Americans advance a proposal about a control commission from the UN, then this proposal should be rejected, with reference to the fact that the UN occupies the position of a warring side, but you should then advance your proposal about a commission of representatives of neutral states named with the agreement of the sides. The fifth point should be proposed and you should insist on it.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">As concerns your remaining two points (about the withdrawal of all foreign troops and about refugees), both of these proposals should be advanced and should be insisted on.</span></p><p class="cs2A4A7CB2"><span class="cs566403DE">FILIPPOV [Stalin].</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">No. 340/III<br>3 July.&quot;<br><br>###</span></p></span>
