    <p>MID USSR No. 23343<br/>Tenth department Received 19 hours 10 minutes<br/>7/XII.1950<br/><br/>Dispatched 20 hours 40 minutes<br/>7/XII.1950<br/><br/>Special No. 1691,1692<br/><br/>CIPHERED TELEGRAM<br/>To BEIJING To SOVIET AMBASSADOR<br/><br/>SPECIAL FILE<br/>TOP PRIORITY<br/><br/>2522. Immediately visit Zhou Enlai and transmit to him the following:<br/><br/>“We completely agree with your conditions for a ceasefire in Korea. We consider that without the satisfaction of these conditions military activity cannot be ceased. In addition, we consider that you should not be too open and show all your cards too early before the representatives of the three states, who, frankly speaking, are spies of the USA.<br/><br/>We think that the time has not arrived for China to show all its cards, while Seoul is still not liberated. Moreover, the USA could use China's five conditions to box us on the ear by [making] a UN resolution. It is not necessary to give this advantage to the USA.<br/><br/>We therefore think that it is possible at the present time to limit oneself to the following:<br/><br/>1. The Chinese Central People's Government along with you, gentlemen delegates of England, Sweden, India would welcome the soonest possible conclusion of the military actions in Korea. China is applying all its strength in order to conclude quickly the military activity forced on Korea and China.<br/><br/>2. Therefore, we would like to know the opinion of the UN and the USA with regard to conditions for an armistice. As far as we know, you have not been commissioned by the UN or the USA to discuss with anyone the conditions for an armistice. Moreover, the delegation from England together with the delegation from the USA, France, Norway, Ecuador and Cuba already introduced into the First Committee [of the General Assembly] of the UN a resolution condemning China, thereby hindering the matter of a settlement of the Korean question. <br/><br/>3. In view of this we will eagerly await the opinion of the UN and USA about the conditions for a cessation of military actions in Korea.<br/><br/>FILIPPOV [Stalin].”<br/><br/>Telegraph the fulfillment.<br/>GROMYKO.<br/>7/XII-50<br/><br/>Copies: Stalin, Molotov, Malenkov, Bulganin, Vyshinsky, 10th Department, Copy</p>  </body>
