To organize the preparation of 200-300 pilots from Korean students, in the flight school already existing in YANTSZY on the territory of MANCHURIA. An additional contingent of Soviet instructors will be given for this.<br><br>2. The preparation of pilots for two jet fighter regiments can be organized at one of our jet divisions of MIG-15&#39;s located in MANCHURIA. After the preparation of the pilots, the appropriate number of MIG-15 planes will be delivered.<br><br>With regard to the preparation of pilots for one bomber regiment, it is more convenient to prepare them in the Korean school we have in the Far East Maritime Region. The materiel, TU-2 planes for the bomber regiment, will also be given.<br><br>3. We agree to accept an additional 120 men in the Korean pilot school that we have in the Far East Maritime Region, to train them as technicians and crew for attack planes.<br><br>4. It is better that the Korean pilots receive flight training in the place where they will study, i.e. in MANCHURIA or in our Maritime Region.<br><br>If you agree with these proposals, corresponding orders will be given to our military command.<br><br>FYN SI [Stalin].<br><br>No. 4/7556<br>20 November 1950<br>Copies: Bulganin, Shtemenko, Stalin.<br></span></p></span>
