The entire course of the negotiations for some time past shows that although the Americans are dragging out the negotiations, they nonetheless are more in need of rapidly concluding them. This is based on the overall international situation.<br><br>We consider it correct that the Chinese/ Korean side, using flexible tactics in the negotiations, continues to pursue a hard line, not showing haste and not displaying interest in a rapid end to the negotiations.<br><br>We consider your position on the definition of the line of demarcation and the establishment of monitoring in one or two border points to be correct. We also agree with you about the composition of the commission for the fulfillment of monitoring functions.<br><br>Your position on the question of an exchange of prisoners of war is completely correct and it will be difficult for the opponent to dispute it.<br><br>As regards the possible variants of convening a conference for the further resolution of the Korean question after the conclusion of an armistice, it seems to us that it would be more expedient to convene a conference of political representatives of both sides which are presently conducting the negotiations, with the obligatory participation of representatives of North and South Korea.<br><br>FILIPPOV [Stalin]<br><br>19 November 1951</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">[</span><span class="cs566403DE">A copy of the telegram sent to Beijing in found in APRF, Fond 45, Opis 1, Delo 342, List 23.]</span></p></span>
