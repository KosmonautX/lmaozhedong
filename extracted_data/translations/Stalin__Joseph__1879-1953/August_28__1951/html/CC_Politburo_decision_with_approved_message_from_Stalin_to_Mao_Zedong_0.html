As before, with regard to this we will proceed from the fact that the Americans have greater need to continue the negotiations.<br><br>We do not see the use in inviting, according to your initiative, representatives of neutral states to participate in the negotiations as monitors and witnesses during the present period of negotiations. The negative side of this proposal is that the Americans will view it as [an indication] that the Chinese-Korean side has more need quickly to reach an agreement about an armistice than do the Americans. If you are of such an opinion on this question, then you must communicate this to Comrade Kim Il Sung.<br><br>FILIPPOV [Stalin].&quot;</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">[</span><span class="cs566403DE">The telegram was sent to Beijing on August 29.]</span></p></span>
