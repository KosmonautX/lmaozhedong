			<li class="cs4DDFDC8F"><span class="cs9633BC1">In its relations with Iran, the DPRK is confronted with South Korean competition. Every time North Korea discusses a problem with Iran, the South Korean embassy was fully informed in the next few days by the Iranians. </span></li></ol>
		<p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs9633BC1">For this reason, his mission and that of the office he directed was very difficult, the Ambassador added, especially since the North Korean diplomatic mission was inaugurated approximately 5 years ago, so it was in the initial stages of its activity.</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs4DDFDC8F"><span class="cs9633BC1">The Ambassador told me that in the foreseeable future, Iran will be visited by a DPRK delegation. The two sides are now negotiating on the date for the visit of this delegation.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs9633BC1">Given the influence enjoyed by South Korea in Iran, the North Koreas regard this visit as a very important initiative to counter the political [efforts] undertaken by the South Korean embassy.</span></p><ol start="3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs4DDFDC8F"><span class="cs9633BC1">Ambassador Ri Yong-ho talked to me in great detail about the current situation in the Korean peninsula, about the American-Japanese-South Korean conspiracy to make permanent the separation of the two Koreas.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs9633BC1">One of the actions undertaken in this respect, he added, is the attempt of the United States to [push forward] the simultaneous admission of the two Koreas in the UN, as two distinct entities, two separate countries.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs9633BC1">This attempt is rejected by the DPRK and by socialist countries, the Ambassador noted. </span></p><ol start="4" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs4DDFDC8F"><span class="cs9633BC1">Next, the [North] Korean Ambassador pointed out that the South Korean authorities are trying to create certain situations which they then try to portray as a recognition of South Korea by socialist countries.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs9633BC1">South Korean diplomats, he said, are trying to have official contacts, to invite or to be invited at various diplomatic events, which they then present as [recognition of South Korea by socialist countries]. The South Koreans know they have no chance of doing so with the Romanians and the Chinese, but they still try this tactic on other socialist diplomats, in some cases getting positive answers from them. There were cases when socialist diplomats in other countries invited, even to official functions, South Korean diplomats, the Ambassador added without any other clarifications.</span></p><ol start="5" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs4DDFDC8F"><span class="cs9633BC1">The North Korean Ambassador spoke in very high terms of Romanian-North Korean relations.</span></li></ol>
