			<span class="cs566403DE">On the 11</span><sup><span class="cs6D6FB01F">th</span></sup><span class="cs566403DE">, Asian Affairs Bureau Director Kwon conveyed the following to Tanino:</span>
		
			
		
			<span class="cs566403DE">(1) We received a briefing from the Japanese Foreign Ministry in Tokyo regarding the Japan-China summit meeting. Upon our immediately conveying its content to the top of our government, the Republic of Korea&rsquo;s leadership was profoundly grateful in particular to Prime Minister Nakasone for his raising issues between the Republic of Korea (ROK) and China during his visit to China.</span>
		
			
		
			<span class="cs566403DE">(2) Meanwhile, a foreign wire story from Beijing was carried in the ROK, with such exaggerated reporting as the ROK side having requested that Japan deliver a personal letter from the president to the Chinese side. The ROK Foreign Ministry has responded with the line:</span>
		
			
		
			<span class="cs566403DE">a) It is not true that we made a request this time of Prime Minister Nakasone in advance of his trip to China that he deliver a personal message.</span>
		
			
		
			<span class="cs566403DE">b) Prime Minister Nakasone knows well from his talks to date with the ROK leader the thinking of the ROK side, so we think that on that basis he explained our thinking suitably to the Chinese side. &nbsp;(Outgoing Telegram No. 3158 &ndash; 2)</span>
		
			
		
			<span class="cs566403DE">(Bureau Director Kwon mentioned, &ldquo;In fact, that is the way it was, so there probably will not be any problem.&rdquo;)</span>
