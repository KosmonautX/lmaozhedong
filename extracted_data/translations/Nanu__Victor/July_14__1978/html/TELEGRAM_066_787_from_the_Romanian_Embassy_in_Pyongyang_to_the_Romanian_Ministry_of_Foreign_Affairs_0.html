With respect to the causes [of this decision] the Korean interlocutor explained that the main problem is that of transporting the delegation. Currently, the DPRK does not have long-haul, across-the-ocean, transportation means. In this respect, 5 years ago, the Koreans asked the USSR to provide them with a IL-62 plane, the Soviets, using different pretexts, did not deliver the plane in question, although [the Koreans] repeated their request and insisted on countless occasions.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">Recently, on the occasion of a meeting, a representative of the Workers&rsquo; Youth Union asked a representative of the Komsomol leadership for support with transporting the Korean delegation to Havana. The Komsomol representative replied that for the matter in question, the president of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers&rsquo; Youth Union send a written note to the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Komsomol. The Koreans said that the reply they received was not the one they [were expecting], and that this represents &lsquo;a form of pressure from a big country which tries to prevent the trip to Havana of the Korean delegation.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">The second issue which contributed to the Korean decision was the lack of financial resources. The Festival&rsquo;s international preparatory committee asked for very significant hard currency sums, which are beyond the necessary amounts for past such events.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">The Koreans, despite the efforts they undertook, did not manage to overcome these difficulties &ndash; the lack of transportation means and of financial resources.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">The Korean Preparatory Committee for the Festival informed the International Committee that the DPRK would not send a youth delegation to the Havana festival.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">Signed</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">Victor Nanu</span></p><p class="cs2D0A5422"><span class="cs566403DE"></span></p></span>
