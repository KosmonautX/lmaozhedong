Such statements are founded on the fact that lately, the United States talk more and more about a policy of &lsquo;rapprochement&rsquo; and of &lsquo;peace.&rsquo; But such assumptions are groundless and they stem from not knowing exactly the reality in the region, the manner in which the American imperialists act. When analyzing the situation in the Korean Peninsula, one must always take into account the big interests that the United States and Japan have in the region. Against this background, pointed out Kim Yeong-nam, the Tanaka government in Japan, supported by reactionary militarist elements in Japan, promoted an unfriendly, even enemy-like approach towards the Democratic People&#39;s Republic of Korea.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">Prime Minister Takeo Miki, said our interlocutor, brought, to a certain extent, some new elements in Japan&rsquo;s approach towards the Democratic People&#39;s Republic of Korea, showing a more understanding attitude, and evidencing some flexibility. But such positive elements are little sensed, they are unconvincing. The support given by Prime Minister Takeo Miki is not sufficiently solid and therefore he is adopting an unstable, oscillating position. Militarist circles, reactionary elements in Japan continue their hostile propaganda towards the Democratic People&#39;s Republic of Korea, stating that in case of the breakout of a war, if American troops are withdrawn from South Korea, Japan is ready to intervene in Korea with its naval and air armed forces. Japan continues to transfer naval forces from Okinawa to American bases in South Korea, with the consent of the Park Chung Hee clique. American-Japanese-South Korean joint military drills are intensifying. At their turn, the South Korean puppets assert that their armed forces are capable of facing off the North Koreans in a military confrontation on their own, which is why they are preparing [so much].</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">The struggle of the popular masses in South Korea for the democratization of society, for the peaceful and independent unification of the homeland is intensifying every day, integrating various social layers and adopting ever more well organized forms, so that they adopt documents like the &ldquo;Declaration for Democracy and Salvation of the Nation&rdquo; (March 1st, 1976).</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">Peace-loving peoples in the entire world support the struggle of the Korean people. In Europe and in other parts of the world, solidarity committees are formed, which support the just cause of the Korean people, condemning the anti-popular regime of the South Korean puppets. Numerous youth, women&rsquo;s, community, religious organizations in Japan, in other countries, criticize the position of those respective countries towards the Democratic People&#39;s Republic of Korea through organized efforts&mdash;rallies, conferences, etc.&mdash;to show their support for the struggle of the Korean people.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">Signed: Charge d&rsquo;Affaires V.
