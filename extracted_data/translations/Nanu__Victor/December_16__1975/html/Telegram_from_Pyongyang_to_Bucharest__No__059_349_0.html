Poland, P.R. Hungary, G.D.R., S.F.R. Yugoslavia and Egypt, are commenting that, during President&rsquo;s Ford visit to Beijing, H. Kissinger insisted that the People&rsquo;s Republic of China agree with the American desire not to withdraw its troops from South Korea and accept the US proposal to convene an international conference&mdash;with the participation of the US, the People&rsquo;s Republic of China, the Democratic People&#39;s Republic of Korea and South Korea&mdash;to discuss the Korean matter. Assumptions are being made that the US is not against a U.S.S.R.-backed proposal that the four countries mentioned above should be joined at the international reunion by the U.S.S.R. and Japan. </span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">Chinese leaders are entirely against an international reunion on the Korean issue to which the U.S.S.R. would participate. It is mentioned (by the G.D.R. counselor) that the People&rsquo;s Republic of China publicly backs the proposal of the Korean government, that the Korean issue be discussed by the Democratic People&#39;s Republic of Korea and the US. In talks with Ford however, Vice-Premier Xiaoping is supposed to have appeared favorable towards the four countries&rsquo; participation formula.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">In a talk with V. Nanu on December 13 this year, Polish Ambassador T. Bialkovsk mentioned that Seo Cheol [So Chol], member of the Political Committee of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers&#39; Party, during a visit to the Polish Embassy (05.12), was asked if Korean leaders are aware of the particular points discussed in Beijing by President Ford on Korea.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">The Korean interlocutor responded that &ldquo;the Democratic People&#39;s Republic of Korea has given no mandate for discussions on the topic, that this is a national issue and should be therefore discussed exclusively among Korean leaders; they are entirely against intermediaries.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">Moreover, Seo Cheol said that the Democratic People&#39;s Republic of Korea leaders unofficially found out that the Korean issue was discussed in Peking, but they are convinced no agreement was reached on the topic.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">The Korean dignitary said that the Democratic People&#39;s Republic of Korea is ready to conduct negotiations with the US but no reply had yet arrived from the latter side.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">We note that the Korean press has not published anything on Ford&rsquo;s visit to Beijing.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Signed: V.
