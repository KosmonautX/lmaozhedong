As an example Pak Seong-cheol pointed to a meeting which was held recently by students of Korea University in Seoul. Many of those who spoke at this meeting favored the withdrawal of foreign troops from South Korea, the establishment of contact between the North and South of the country, the creation of a Committee of representatives of North and South Korea, and the holding of national elections in both parts of Korea under the supervision of observers from neutral countries. A National Committee to speed up the peaceful reunification of Korea was created at the meeting of students.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">Another example, Pak Seong-cheol continued, is the statement of representatives of the so-called &quot;Institute for the Study of the Korean Question&quot; in New York that after reunification Korea should become a neutral country not connected with either of the camps.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">In addition, said Pak Seong-cheol, at the present time there exist many other opinions and rumors in South Korea about the issue of peaceful reunification. Accordingly, we think that there is a need to again make a statement in our legislative body, the Supreme People&#39;s Assembly, about the peaceful reunification of the motherland. This statement will not contain anything new, it will only give concrete expression to Cde. Kim Il Sung&#39;s proposals about the creation of a confederation of the North and South and other steps concerning peaceful reunification.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">Then Pak Seong-cheol said that when drawing up the program for Cde. N. S. Khrushchev&#39;s visit to the DPRK a provision was made for his speech at a session of the Supreme People&#39;s Assembly on this issue. He continued, in connection with the situation developing in South Korea we plan to convene the session on 15 October but, not knowing when Cde. Khrushchev will be able to come to the DPRK, I would like to consult with you about this issue.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">I replied that the facts indicative of the public movement in South Korea for peaceful reunification about which Pak Seong-cheol spoke deserve attention. They say that the consistent and persistent policy of the KWP CC and the government of the republic directed at a peaceful solution of the Korean question are producing positive results. The new proposals of Cde. Kim Il Sung presented in his report devoted to the 15th anniversary of the liberation of Korea are attracting great attention from the population of South Korea and world public opinion. The Soviet government has a very high opinion of these proposals. Speaking at the 15th UN General Assembly session Cde. N. S. Khrushchev supported them completely as reasonable and meeting the national aspirations of the Korean people.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">I said that in connection with the sentiments in South Korea mentioned above there is also a clear need to discuss this issue in the DPRK legislative body in order to adopt the corresponding documents which would give concrete expression to Cde. Kim Il Sung&#39;s proposals about the peaceful reunification of the country. The question of when to convene the session of the Supreme People&#39;s Assembly should in my opinion be decided by the Korean friends themselves. Regarding the date of arrival in the DPRK of Cde. N. S. Khrushchev I still do not have any information concerning this matter. As everyone knows, at the present time Cde. N. S. Khrushchev and the other heads of state of the socialist camp are doing great and important work in the UN for peace throughout the entire world.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">I expressed my view that inasmuch as the suggestion for a speech by Cde. N. S. Khrushchev at a session of the Supreme People&#39;s Assembly was made by the KWP CC, then in the situation specifically unfolding right now [you] probably should act as the KWP CC considers necessary.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">After the views I stated above, Pak Seong-cheol said the following:</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">&quot;The KWP CC intends to convene a session of the Supreme People&#39;s Assembly on 15 October. But we do not know whether Cde. N. S. Khrushchev will be able to take part in the session at this time and would like to consult with the CPSU CC: if Cde. N. S. Khrushchev will not be able to be in the DPRK at this time then should we not postpone the convening of the session until his arrival. The KWP CC will take the views expressed by the CPSU CC into consideration&quot;.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">I replied that I will immediately send the above request to Moscow.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">Then, taking advantage of the occasion, I informed Pak Seong-cheol about the number and content of the welcoming letters and telegrams coming to the Embassy addressed to Cde. N. S. Khrushchev.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">Pak Seong-cheol noted that all these letters and telegrams are an expression of the feelings of eternal friendship and love for the Soviet people which the Korean people constantly carry in their hearts.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">Deputy Foreign Minister Kim Tae-hui took part in the conversation from the Korean side. Embassy Third Secretary D. A. Priyemsky was present at the conversation and interpreted.</span></p><p class="cs2A4A7CB2"><span class="cs566403DE">xxx</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">I gave a return dinner for Chinese Ambassador Qiao Xiaoguang. The Ambassador and his wife, interpreter Li Wendai, and Embassy officials Counsellor V. I. Pelishenko and interpreter B. M. Morozov attended. It was notable that the Ambassador avoided holding a discussion on any political themes, which had not been previously observed. In particular, he did not react at all to the recent speech by N. S. Khrushchev at the 15</span><sup><span class="cs6D6FB01F">th</span></sup><span class="cs566403DE"> UN General Assembly session on the issue of the legal rights of the PRC at the UN.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">[&hellip;]</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">SOVIET AMBASSADOR IN THE DPRK [signature]		(A.
