During the reception Kim Il Sung talked in general terms about the situation in the DPRK and also provided information that a KWP CC Plenum had been convened on 20 December of this year which examined the results of the fulfillment of the economic plan for 1960 and the plan for the development of the DPRK economy for 1961; it also especially examined the issue of further measures concerning the development of agriculture.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">In reply to my question whether Kim Il Sung said that the report of the KWP delegation about the results of the Moscow Conference of Representatives of Communist and Worker&#39;s Parties would be heard, as Kim Il talked about this in a conversation with me, E. Stanciu replied that Kim Il Sung said nothing to him about this. During the conversation with Choe Yong-geon, the Ambassador said that the latter told about responses in South Korea to the decision of the 7</span><sup><span class="cs6D6FB01F">th</span></sup><span class="cs566403DE"> session of the Supreme People&#39;s Assembly. </span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Then Emil Stanciu said that during protocol visits all the ambassadors, with the exception of the Albanian, Vietnamese, and Chinese [ambassadors], made critical comments without any questions from him about the fact that in their reports the Korean leaders are not telling the people about the great aid which the Soviet Union and the other socialist countries are giving the DPRK in the recovery and development of its economy. </span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">The Ambassador asked how correct this is.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">I replied to the Ambassador that in the last report at the 7</span><sup><span class="cs6D6FB01F">th</span></sup><span class="cs566403DE"> session of the Supreme People&#39;s Assembly Deputy Premier Ri Jeong-ok said nothing at all about the aid of the socialist countries to the DPRK in the recovery and development of its economy. Other reports made previously also spoke about this, but little. It could be said that on this issue the Korean comrades are exhibiting duplicity and inconsistency. On the one hand, for example, when they start up a particular enterprise built with the aid of the socialist countries, they speak quite broadly about this in the press; or, when preparing to meet Cde. N. S. Khrushchev rallies and meetings of blue- and white-collar workers are held at all enterprises and agricultural cooperatives. The Embassy has received over 37,000 complimentary letters and telegrams. In these telegrams and also, as we know, at the rallies and meetings of workers much was said about the enormous aid of the Soviet Union to the DPRK. On the other hand, very little is said in official reports about the aid of the Soviet Union and socialist countries or, as in the last report of Ri Jeong-ok, nothing is said at all.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">[&hellip;]</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">SOVIET AMBASSADOR IN THE DPRK [signature] (A.
