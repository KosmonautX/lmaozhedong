The Albanian Ambassador said that recently an official of the Albanian Embassy in Peking had come to them and told about the recall by the Soviet government of all its specialists in China. In Kurt Schneidewind&#39;s words, the Albanian Ambassador said the following on his own: the Soviet government is acting incorrectly: it helps India and Indonesia and at the same time recalls Soviet specialists from a fraternal socialist country, China. In reply to the comment of Kurt Schneidewind that evidently there are grounds for the recall of the Soviet specialists from China expressed in the incorrect behavior of the Chinese comrades themselves, Gedeshi replied that only the Soviet leaders had behaved incorrectly in this case.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">For his part Kurt Schneidewind express sharp dissatisfaction with the incorrect statements of the Albanian Ambassador.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">I thanked Kurt Schneidewind for the information.</span></p><p class="cs2A4A7CB2"><span class="cs566403DE">xxx</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">I visited Kim Il Sung and passed him a CPSU CC Presidium letter on the issue of the visit to the DPRK by Cde. N. S. Khrushchev.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">I read the text of the letter and said on my own: Cde. N. S. Khrushchev wants very much to visit the DPRK. He always spoke to me about this when I was with him at receptions. Nikita Sergeyevich spoke about this to you during the last meeting on 17 June. The CPSU CC Presidium knows that the KWP leadership and DPRK government and the entire Korean people are awaiting the arrival of Cde. N. S. Khrushchev with great desire. More than 37,000 welcoming letters and telegrams have come to the Embassy suffused with warmth and great friendship for the Soviet people.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Only circumstances which have developed with time caused the necessity of consulting with you about postponing the visit of Cde. N. S. Khrushchev.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Kim Il Sung listened to the CPSU CC Presidium letter with great attention. It could be noted that the warmth and cordiality of the letter made a deep impression. After familiarization with the content of the letter Kim Il Sung said with some emotion: </span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">&quot;We well understand that Cde. N. S. Khrushchev is going enormous work in New York right now. This work has great importance and it cannot be interrupted. After return Cde. Khrushchev will have to deal with preparations for the Conference. So we fully understand all these circumstances which force the postponement of the time of the visit.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">We awaited the arrival of Cde. N. S. Khrushchev and carried out preparatory work. But this work will not be lost. This is necessary work. It was directed at strengthening the friendship and unity with the Soviet Union.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">It is advisable to publish a report in the press simultaneously about the postponement of the visit.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">It ought not to be consider awkward that it happed this way, the time of the visit is being postponed. We completely agree with the views of the CPSU CC. The most important thing is to make a contribution to a reduction of international tension. Right now it is more important than to visit Korea.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">A new time for the visit of Cde. N. S. Khrushchev to the DPRK can be arranged with him personally when meeting in November&quot;.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Then Kim Il Sung added in the form of question:</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">This visit will hardly take place this year since it&#39;s cold here in winter. After visiting Korea Cde. N. S. Khrushchev wanted to go to Sakhalin and there, as we know, there is very much snow in winter. Therefore possibly the visit will take place in spring of next year?</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">As regards the time of publication Kim Il Sung said 12 October. This time was named in connection with the fact that a festive meeting will take place on 10 October in connection with the 15</span><sup><span class="cs6D6FB01F">th</span></sup><span class="cs566403DE"> anniversary of the creation of the Korean Worker&#39;s Party and a report will be published on 11 October.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">With respect to the text of the report for the press Kim Il Sung said that after translation into Korean it will be considered and an appropriate opinion will be reported to the Embassy. (No changes to the text came. Only a title was suggested. The report was published in the Korean press on 12 October 1960).</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">I thanked Kim Il Sung for the correct understanding and complete agreement with the ideas expressed in the CPSU CC Presidium letter.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Minister Pak Seong-cheol was present at the conversation.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">The conversation was interpreted by Embassy Third Secretary D.
