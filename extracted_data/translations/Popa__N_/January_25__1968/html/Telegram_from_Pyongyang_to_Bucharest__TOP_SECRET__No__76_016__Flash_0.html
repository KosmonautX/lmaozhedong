These two [air force] units will be based next to Munsan and Gunsan in the vicinity of the DMZ.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Moreover, all American air force units in Japan have been instructed that they will take action against the DPRK if necessary, as long as the North Koreans do not release the captured American vessel.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Signed: N.
