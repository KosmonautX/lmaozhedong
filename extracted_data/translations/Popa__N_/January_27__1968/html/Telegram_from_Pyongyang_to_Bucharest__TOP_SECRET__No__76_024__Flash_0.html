The note did not ask for a reply.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">After justifying the capture of the USS Pueblo as a self-defense measure and stating that the threats and blackmailing undertaken by the aggressors would not frighten the North Korean people, who are always ready to repel any sort of aggression, the document condemned the fact that the incident was discussed by the United Nations Security Council. The document describes the discussion of this internal matter of the DPRK as illegal and advised the UN not to repeat its shameful history as a tool of aggression against the Korean people.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">We believe it is advisable to explore the possibilities to insert a paraphrased text of the aforementioned declaration in our press, quoting its source; a reserved position towards the Korean request would upset the Korean leadership, which we should avoid, especially now that our bilateral relations are experiencing a turning point in their development.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">The title of the declaration was released on January 27 by the Korean Central News Agency ACTC.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Signed: N. Popa</span></p></span>
