Kados, the Hungarian Ambassador to Pyongyang, who told me that after repeated discussions with the leadership of the North Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the issue of the USS Pueblo incident at the United Nations Security Council, the North Korean government informed the Hungarian government (which is currently a non-permanent member) that it was ready to send its delegation to the meeting of the Council, provided it was invited.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Although claiming that discussing the USS Pueblo incident at the UN represents a brutal interference in the internal affairs [of the DPRK] and that any resolution adopted will be considered null and void, the North Korean government has decided to take part in the discussion of this matter &lsquo;to be able to defend itself against the calumnies brought up with respect to the USS Pueblo incident, as well as against the insinuations regarding the latest events in Seoul&rsquo; and to unmask the provocative actions of the US and of its South Korean puppet.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">We predict that Hungary, the Soviet Union, and Algeria will press to have the DPRK delegation invited to New York.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Signed: N.
