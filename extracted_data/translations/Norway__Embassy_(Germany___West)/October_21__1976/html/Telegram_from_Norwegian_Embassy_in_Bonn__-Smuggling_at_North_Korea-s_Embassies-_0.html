Chief of the operation was Colonel Kim Hak Tschel [sic], who until recently functioned as military attach&eacute; at the embassy. The newspaper claims to have proof that beyond smuggling, the organization was involved in extensive arms trade and espionage. </span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Customs authorities and security services in West Berlin have over a longer period observed the traffic around the Embassy.
