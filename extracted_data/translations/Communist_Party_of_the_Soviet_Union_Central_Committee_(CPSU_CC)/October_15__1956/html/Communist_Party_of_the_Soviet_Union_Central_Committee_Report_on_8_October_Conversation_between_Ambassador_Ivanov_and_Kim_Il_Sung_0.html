Ivanov, it is clear that Kim Il Sung essentially rejected the advice concerning the publication of the entire text of the decree of the KWP CC Plenum. &nbsp;Kim Il Sung requested that Ivanov convey to cde. Mikoyan that there is no need to publish the entire decree of the September Plenum, which would be circulated to party organizations for discussion. &nbsp;Furthermore, the leadership of the KWP considers it pointless to give wide publicity to the decree of the plenum. &nbsp;Kim Il Sung alleged that there was not, apparently, a special agreement with comrades Mikoyan and [Chinese Minister of Defense] Peng Dehuai about publishing the complete text of the decree. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Ambassador Comrade Ivanov suggested familiarizing the Chinese ambassador in the DPRK with the contents of the discussion with Kim Il Sung on 8 October.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">We consider it expedient to agree with the opinion of Comrade Ivanov. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">A draft of the telegram to the ambassador in Korea is attached.</span></p><p class="cs4837E680"><span class="cs566403DE">Deputy Director of the Department of the Central Committee of the CPSU </span></p><p class="cs4837E680"><span class="cs566403DE">for Relations with Foreign Communist Parties.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">(I.
