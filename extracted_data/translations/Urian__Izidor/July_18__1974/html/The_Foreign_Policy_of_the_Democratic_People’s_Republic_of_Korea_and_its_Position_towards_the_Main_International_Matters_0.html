Therefore, only in 1973, the Democratic People&#39;s Republic of Korea established diplomatic relations with 12 countries, joined the World Health Organization and the Interparliamentary Union, opened a permanent observer office at the United Nations and took part, for the first time, in the workings of the General Assembly of the United Nations as an observer. In 1974, the Democratic People&#39;s Republic of Korea established diplomatic relations with Gabon, Costa Rica, Nepal and Guyana, it joined the World Postal Union and the International Atomic Energy Agency, and it took part for the first time in the UN Conference on Maritime Law, in Caracas.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">The number of countries with which the Democratic People&#39;s Republic of Korea currently has diplomatic and consular relations rises to approximately 70, and the number of countries with which the Democratic People&#39;s Republic of Korea currently has economic relations is over 80.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">The recent proposal of the Democratic People&#39;s Republic of Korea (dating back to March 1974) is to replace the 1953 armistice with a Korean-American peace treaty, which must comprise the following provisions:</span></p><ul start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csFBD11AD9"><span class="cs566403DE">That the United States commits not to obstruct the peaceful and independent reunification of Korea; </span></li><li class="csFBD11AD9"><span class="cs566403DE">That both sides end the arms races;</span></li><li class="csFBD11AD9"><span class="cs566403DE">That foreign troops stationed in South Korea cease to be considered as UN troops and then that these troops are withdrawn.</span></li></ul>
		<p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">It did not trigger any particular echo, not even amongst socialist countries. The American reaction was limited, for the time being, to a statement from the spokesman of the Department of State, which said that &ldquo;by requesting the negotiation of a peace treaty with the United States of America, the Democratic People&#39;s Republic of Korea is planning to exclude South Korea from the negotiations, which the United States cannot accept.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="csA0E9A871">The Relations of the Democratic People&#39;s Republic of Korea with the USSR and with the People&rsquo;s Republic of China </span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">With the emergence and especially with the aggravation of the Sino-Soviet divergences, the Democratic People&#39;s Republic of Korea sought to promote an independent line and to stay out of public disagreements, without always being able to do so.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">Therefore, between 1963 and 1965 Korean-Soviet relations were noticeably tense. The North Korean media published several materials in which the Democratic People&#39;s Republic of Korea expressed its official discontent towards the manner in which the history of Korea was presented in the Soviet encyclopedia as well as towards the manner in which the &ldquo;Economic Seminar&rdquo; in Pyongyang was presented in the Soviet press.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">Between 1966 and 1967, on the one hand, there was a rapprochement of the Democratic People&#39;s Republic of Korea towards the Soviet Union, from which North Korea received substantial economic aid, and, on the other hand, relations with the People&rsquo;s Republic of China stalled. The Korean media released certain materials in which it expressed its discontent and disapproval towards the criticism put forward during the Cultural Revolution with respect to the North Korean leadership.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">After the visits of Choe Yong-geon [Choe Yong Gon] in the People&rsquo;s Republic of China (in 1969) and after the visit of Zhou Enlai to the Democratic People&#39;s Republic of Korea (1970), Korean-Chinese relations have experienced a process of continuous improvement. At the same time, there is a simultaneous reserve in the relations between the Democratic People&#39;s Republic of Korea and the USSR.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">Officially it is said that the Democratic People&#39;s Republic of Korea has good relations with both countries.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">[&hellip;]</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">July 18, 1974</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">Written by Izidor Urian</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">Typed by Sirbu, C.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">3 copies</span></p></span>
