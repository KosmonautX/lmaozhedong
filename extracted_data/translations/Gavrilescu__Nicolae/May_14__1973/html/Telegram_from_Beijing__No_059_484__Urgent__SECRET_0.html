Therefore, the North Korean diplomat said, the South Koreans at the negotiations table adopt a position which encourages the exchange of views, while they take hostile actions behind the scenes.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">According to the administration in Seoul, the Americans stationed in South Korea are not an occupying force, and therefore, it is out of the question that they leave.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">The North Koreans are aware of the difficulties involved in negotiating [with the South Koreans], but they still believe that it is possible to cooperate with the South in certain areas, especially on economic issues, to the mutual advantage of both parties.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">To achieve this goal, the North Korean diplomat added, the DPRK government already put forward concrete proposals, such as:</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs8F481057"><span class="cs566403DE">Taking care of the excess work force in South Korea and helping [the South Koreans] cope with the emigration [of the unemployed] abroad, by hiring the available workers in industrial complexes in the North, where laborers are badly needed.</span></li><li class="cs8F481057"><span class="cs566403DE">Jointly creating an irrigation system by employing the equipment and richer expertise accumulated by the North in this field.</span></li><li class="cs8F481057"><span class="cs566403DE">Instituting a unitary system for fishing methods and the ensuing processing industry (granting fishermen from both sides to fish in the fishing areas around the entire peninsula, without restrictions).</span></li><li class="cs8F481057"><span class="cs566403DE"> Opening the gates at the 38th parallel to create the opportunity for the free circulation of the population.</span></li><li class="cs8F481057"><span class="cs566403DE">Jointly creating a linguistic unification plan. Currently, the North Korean diplomat added, the South is under American and Japanese influences.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">The reaction of the [South Korean] counterparts continues to be equivocal and it is basically going against the idea of adopting concrete measures for the relaxation of tensions. The desire of the DPRK to remove existing barriers is interpreted as an attempt to infiltrate the South and to undermine the government in Seoul, by triggering a civil war.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Lastly, the North Korean diplomat said that the DPRK government perseveres in its constructive position, being truthfully motivated by its faith in the possibility of uniting the country peacefully, without interference from the outside.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Signed: N. Gavrilescu</span></p></span>
