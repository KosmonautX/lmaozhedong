Vyshinsky</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">I report the letter from KIM IL SUNG to Comrade STALIN I.V. of 16.7.52.</span></p><p class="cs2A4A7CB2"><span class="cs566403DE">RAZUVAEV</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Copies: Stalin (2), Molotov, Malenkov, Beria, Mikoyan, Kaganovich, Bulganin, Khrushchev, Vyshinsky, Sokolovsky.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">No. 2250</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">17.7.52</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">&ldquo;Respected comrade ambassador, I ask you to bring to the attention of Comrade STALIN I.V. the contents of the following telegram:</span></p><p class="cs2A4A7CB2"><span class="cs566403DE">&ldquo;Dear Comrade STALIN I.V.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">I consider it necessary to report to you, Josef Visarrionovich, about the following: proceeding from a general analysis of the situation in Korea the possibility is not excluded that the negotiations for an armistice can be drawn out for an indefinite period of time.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Over the past year of negotiations we have virtually curtailed military operations and moved to a passive defense.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Such a position has led to the fact that the enemy almost without suffering any kind of losses constantly inflicts on us huge losses in manpower and material values.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Thus, for example, just recently the enemy put out of operation all the electrical stations of Korea and because of the active operations of VVS [air force] does not allow the possibility to restore them, which has caused and continues to cause huge losses to the entire national economy of the DPRK.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">In only one 24 hour period of barbaric bombing, of only one city of Pyongyang (on July 11 and the night of July 12) more than 6,000 peaceful inhabitants were killed and wounded.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">The enemy, making use of this situation, makes demands in the negotiations that are unacceptable to us.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Naturally, the Chinese friends refuse to accept these conditions. We share the opinion of Comrade MAO ZEDONG on this question.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">However, in order to spare the DPRK and its people suffering and unjustified, needless losses, it is necessary for us hopefully to provide cover for the most important sites and to go over to active operations.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">For this it would be desirable:</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">1. To strengthen antiaircraft defense. By our accounting, for this it is necessary to receive additional arms for ten antiaircraft regiments (including three middle caliber regiments and seven small caliber regiments).</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">It is desirable in connection with this that the Chinese comrades put out half and that the KPA receive arms for five antiartillery regiments directly from you.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">2. To activate the night operations of the VVS [Air Force] of the KPA [Korean People&#39;s Army] and CPV [Chinese People&#39;s Volunteers]. It is necessary to cover North Korea in the daytime with fighter aviation, if only up to the line of Pyongyang.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">VVS of the KPA is prepared at any time to begin active military operations. Along with this, in the near future 40 crews of KPA TU-2 pilots will finish their training in the Soviet Union. We would like for these pilots to come to the DPRK together with TU-2 airplanes so that they could immediately take part in active military operations and bring influence to bear on important enemy sites.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">3. To carry out a number of ground operations, appreciable to the enemy, so as to divert the operations of the enemy VVS from our rear and to influence the course of the negotiations in Kaeseong.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Aside from all of this, to raise the battle capability of the KPA it is extremely necessary for us to receive from you in the nearest future technical goods and materials according to our note of January 10, 1952 and July 9, 1952 and application for 1952 in the note of October 6, 1951, within the limits of your possibilities.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">4. In Kaeseong we need simultaneously to move decisively toward the soonest conclusion of an armistice, a ceasefire and transfer of all prisoners of war on the basis of the Geneva convention. These demands are supported by all peace loving peoples and will lead us out of a passive position in Kaeseong.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">The change in the character of military operations on the ground and in the air will have a corresponding, desirable influence on the enemy.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">A telegram of analogous content was sent to comrade MAO ZEDONG.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">The Korean people are boundlessly grateful to you for the enormous selfless assistance being rendered to the Korean People&#39;s Democratic Republic.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">We await your orders and advice on the aforementioned questions.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">We wish you good health and long years of life for the well-being and happiness of progressive humanity.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">With deep respect and esteem</span></p><p class="cs2A4A7CB2"><span class="cs566403DE">Your Kim Il Sung</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Pyongyang 16.7.52.&rdquo;</span></p></span>
