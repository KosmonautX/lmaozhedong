I informed Comrade Kohousek briefly about our policy, the measures we implemented, and some new aspects and developments in the relationship between both [German] states. (Policy of peaceful coexistence etc.).</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">From his perspective, Comrade Kohousek told how the Czechoslovak Embassy attempts to influence opinions of DPRK comrades by showing movies about Berlin and German militarism and revanchism, as well through publishing the [embassy&#39;s] bulletin. Regarding attitudes of the KWP about the XXII [CPSU] Party Congress, Comrade Kohousek stated Comrade Kim Il Sung had to maneuver in light of influences and pressures from the Chinese Communist Party. Like Comrade Puzanov, the ambassador of the USSR, Kohousek thinks that, together with Pak Seong-cheol [Pak Song Chol], Kim Il Sung still plays the most positive role in the KWP politburo.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">I stated my opinion that the following stands in contradiction [to that assessment]: The quite open support for positions of the Albanian leadership through the telegrams to Enver Hoxha, the complete publication of the speech made by the Albanian ambassador at the occasion of the Albanian national holiday, the publishing of Enver Hoxha&#39;s provocative reply telegram on the 1</span><sup><span class="cs6D6FB01F">st</span></sup><span class="cs566403DE"> page of the KWP newspaper, the generous arrangement for the Albanian reception &ndash; all that although Comrade Kim Il Sung was aware of positions and reactions from the ambassadors of most of the socialist countries. Comrade Kohousek also thought that apparently the influence of the Chinese party is strongest within the Korean army. On that some facts and opinions later in a separate note.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">[signed] </span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">K[urt] Schneidewind</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Ambassador</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="csA0E9A871">CC:</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">1x Comrade Florin</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">1x Comrade Schwab</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">1x Comrade Stude</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">1x Embassy</span></p></span>
