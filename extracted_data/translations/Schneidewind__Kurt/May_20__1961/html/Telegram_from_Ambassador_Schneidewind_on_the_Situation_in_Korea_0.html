On the one hand it does welcome the overthrow of the Chang Myeon Clique, while at the same time it condemns initiators and leading politicians behind the military coup as reactionary. Nevertheless the statement still has lines like the following: &ldquo; [&hellip;] The soldiers, privates, officers, and generals of the South Korean defense forces, who were rising up to stage a military coup, have to reject maneuvers by those who violate their [the defense forces&#39;] demands and attempt to sell out the national interests. They immediately must begin patriotic actions and stand side by side with the people [&hellip;].&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Furthermore: &ldquo; [&hellip;] Since the treasonous Chang Myeon Clique has been finished, it is imperative today to decisively strike against interference and cabals, if one wants to move the currently existing situation in South Korea towards a path of preserving the interests of the fatherland and the nation [&hellip;].&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">In light of the openly anti-communist demonstrations held yesterday in Seoul this statement by ZTAK is unsatisfactory. It is still lacking a clear assessment of this reactionary military coup.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">The diplomatic representatives of socialist countries [in Pyongyang] think the Korean comrades allowed themselves to get confused through the initial statement from American representatives; and also through the fact that students and other circles initially welcomed this military coup out of excitement about the overthrow of Chang Myeon. For the Korean comrades, the military coup came as surprising as the April events last year [1960]. Although this [ZTAK] statement comes out against the reactionary and counterrevolutionary leaders of the coup, in our opinion it is falling short of providing a correct assessment. It fails to point at the enormous danger created by this military coup.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Full text of the statement will be sent with next courier.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Schneidewind </span></p></span>
