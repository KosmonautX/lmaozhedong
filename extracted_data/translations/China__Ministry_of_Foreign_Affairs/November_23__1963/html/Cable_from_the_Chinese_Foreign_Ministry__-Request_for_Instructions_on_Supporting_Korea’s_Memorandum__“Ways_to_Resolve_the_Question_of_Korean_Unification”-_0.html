			<span class="cs5EFED22F">1. Corresponding with [North] Korea&rsquo;s statement issued prior to the United Nations General Assembly&rsquo;s discussion on the Korea issue, we expressed support for [North] Korea&rsquo;s [position] via a Ministry of Foreign Affairs statement and editorials published in the </span><span class="csA62DFD6A">People&rsquo;s Daily, Ta Kung Pao, </span><span class="cs5EFED22F">and the</span><span class="csA62DFD6A"> Guangming Daily</span><span class="cs5EFED22F">.</span>
		
			
		
			<span class="cs5EFED22F">2. Corresponding with [North] Korea&rsquo;s statement following the passage of a &ldquo;resolution&rdquo; on the Korean issue by the United Nations General Assembly, we expressed support [for North Korea] by issuing joint statements from the China Peace Committee and eight mass organizations and editorials published in the </span><span class="csA62DFD6A">People&rsquo;s Daily</span><span class="cs5EFED22F">.</span>
		
			
		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The above views have been approved by the Central Committee. The first item has already been implemented, while the second item is being prepared.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs5EFED22F">We received a telegram from the Chinese Embassy in [North] Korea saying that the [North] Korean Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs [Kim Tae-hui] received envoys from various countries on the 22 [November]. [The Vice Minister] distributed a [North] Korean memorandum entitled &ldquo;Ways to Resolve the Question of Korean Unification&rdquo; in response to the United Nations General Assembly&rsquo;s discussion of the Korea issue. He hoped that the governments [of the envoys] could provide support [to North Korea on this issue].</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Apart from publishing the full text of the [North] Korean memorandum in the People&rsquo;s Daily, we will have other newspapers and the Xinhua News Agency broadcast the full text in English. In response to the [North] Korean request, we will take appropriate action and are proposing the following two options:</span></p>
			
		
			<span class="cs5EFED22F">1. Have the </span><span class="csA62DFD6A">People&rsquo;s Daily</span><span class="cs5EFED22F"> publish editorials expressing support (the </span><span class="csA62DFD6A">People&rsquo;s Daily</span><span class="cs5EFED22F"> can issue editorials after the United Nations General Assembly passes a &ldquo;resolution&rdquo; and [North] Korea issues their statement).</span>
		
			
		
			<span class="cs5EFED22F">2. Or the </span><span class="csA62DFD6A">People&rsquo;s Daily </span><span class="cs5EFED22F">can temporarily refrain from publishing editorials and have other organizations&rsquo; personnel express support [for North Korea] by separately talking to newspapers. These organizations include the China Peace Committee, the Sino-Korean Friendship Association, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All China Women&rsquo;s Federation, and the Communist Youth League of China.</span>
		
			
		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs5EFED22F">We are more inclined towards the first proposal.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs5EFED22F">If this is appropriate, please give instructions.</span></p><p class="cs1157FFE2"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Ministry of Foreign Affairs</span></p><p class="cs1157FFE2"><span class="cs5EFED22F">November 1963</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Note: Eventually, the </span><span class="csA62DFD6A">People&rsquo;s Daily </span><span class="cs5EFED22F">did issue a commentary [on this issue].</span></p></span>
