He declared at the same time that an appropriate guarantee is required; only in this even might combat operations be halted.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">I inform you of my opinion on this question.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Please study and give a reply, but also please inform Cde. Kim Il Sung of this directly.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">1. Cde. Kim Il Sung presumably should give a reply to Ridgway on 2 or 3 July. He should express agreement in this reply to hold negotiations [between] representatives of both sides about a cessation of combat operations and suggest a time, place, and number of participants of the meeting.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">2. As regards the place of holding the negotiations, Ridgway proposed the port of Wonsan.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Considering that Wonsan is a fortified naval base of North Korea and the enemy intends to land a party there, it seems to me disadvantageous to agree to hold negotiations in Wonsan.

In order to provide our representatives with time to fully prepare for the conference it seems to me advantageous to set 15 July as the date of the beginning of the meeting. </span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">4.
