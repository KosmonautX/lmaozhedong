I have received your two telegrams (of 24.6.51 and 28.6.51). I fully agree with your opinion.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">a) As regards the time periods for the delivery of armaments for sixteen divisions, we should act only on the basis of the productive and transport possibilities of the Soviet Union, that is [we should] complete the deliveries of arms for sixteen divisions in the course of three years, and in 1951 complete the deliveries for ten divisions.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">b) The staff-organizational structure you have proposed for the present Chinese infantry divisions is very good. We are implementing it. With sixteen divisions armed in accordance with this staff-organizational structure, the Chinese army will be far stronger than at present.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">2. Malik&#39;s statement secured us the initiative in the matter of conducting peace negotiations. On 28.6.51 I received through Comrade Roshchin the main positions of the contents of the conversation of Comrade Gromyko with the American ambassador to the Soviet Union, [Alan] Kirk. At the end of the text is stated: &ldquo;Only two representatives must participate from each side. Moreover these representatives must be from the command of the corresponding military units, and not representatives of the governments.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Thus, from the Chinese side a representative of the volunteer troops must participate and not a representative of China, as a warring state.&rdquo; I consider this completely correct.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">I have received a telegram from Comrade Kim Il Sung in which he asks how he should answer if Ridgway calls for negotiations to begin.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">I have already communicated to Comrade Kim Il Sung and Peng Dehuai that on the one hand we must carefully watch the military situation so as not to give the enemy the possibility of using this moment to his advantage, and on the other hand Comrade Kim Il Sung and Peng Dehuai must discuss this question and be prepared, in case of a demand by the enemy to begin negotiations, to send corresponding representatives to conduct negotiations.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">As regards how to answer Ridgway, after receiving a demand from Ridgway, the contents should be discussed and an answer formulated. What is your opinion on this question?</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">If negotiations begin, it is extremely necessary that you personally lead them, so that we do not find ourselves in a disadvantageous position.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">I send you for familiarization the telegram of Comrade Kim Il Sung.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">MAO ZEDONG</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">No. 3260</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">30.6</span></p></span>
