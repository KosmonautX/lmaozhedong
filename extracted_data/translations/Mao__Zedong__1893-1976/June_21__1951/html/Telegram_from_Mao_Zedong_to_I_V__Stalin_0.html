Comrade Gao Gang has returned and transmitted your opinion on various questions.<br><br>I consider that they are all correct and we must do precisely thus.<br><br>As regards the question of planting rubber trees, we intend immediately to start the planning.<br><br>I hope that the Soviet government will send its representatives to assist us in formulating plans.<br><br>2. Our troops&#39; eight months of experience in conducting war in Korea has clearly shown the great difference in the equipment of our troops and the troops of the enemy and the extreme necessity of improving the equipment of our troops. This is why we commissioned Comrade Gao Gang to appeal to you with a request about delivery to us of arms for sixty divisions, to which you agreed. This is the minimal requirement of our troops in Korea for the present year.<br><br>Upon his return Gao Gang said that you consider our requirements in arms for each division insufficient and proposed to strengthen each division with tanks and artillery.<br><br>I consider this completely correct. This is necessary in war against imperialists.<br><br>I already sent a telegram to Comrade Xu Xiangqian [with instructions] to conduct the negotiations fully in accordance with your opinion.<br><br>3. According a telegram received from Comrade Xu Xiangqian after his preliminary negotiations with representatives of the Soviet General Staff, of the total quantity of arms for sixty divisions according to the calculation of the Soviet General Staff, arms for only sixteen divisions will be delivered this year (including for three Korean [divisions]), and arms for the remaining forty-four divisions will be delivered in 1952-1953. This is in contradiction to the needs and time frame of the Korean theater of military operations.<br><br>4. For the goal of satisfying the urgent needs of the Korean theater of military operations, I ask you to study the applications transmitted by Comrade Gao Gang to Comrade Xu Xiangqian, and explore the possibility of fulfilling all deliveries of rifles, artillery, tanks, airplanes, automobiles, spare parts for automobiles and GSM, medicines and other military equipment, at 1/6 [of the total] monthly, from July to the end of the year, so that the various military units in the Korean theater of military operations receive replenishment according to the presently existing organizational structure, what is advantageous for the conduct of military operations.<br><br>5. With the availability this year of deliveries of arms according to our applications, the missing quantity of arms needed for units in accordance with the new organizational structure proposed by the Soviet General Staff can be delivered in the next year. Simultaneously with this, in accordance with the delivery of arms, we will reorganize the selections for this division and in that way gradually convert the sixteen divisions to the new organization.<br><br>6. We have delayed our applications for three months and have thus brought great harm to ourselves. Today we suddenly have appealed to you with such large numbers and want all this to be delivered in six months. This places before you great difficulties, especially in the area of transport. I do not know if this can be done. I ask you to do as much as is possible.<br><br>MAO ZEDONG<br><br>No. 3107 21.6.51<br><br>###</span></p></span>
