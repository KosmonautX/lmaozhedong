It is because the Communist Party had taken control of China.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">Because of Stalin&rsquo;s pressure, the Northeast and Xinjiang became [a Soviet] sphere of influence, and four jointly owned and operated enterprises were established.<a href="#_ftn2"><a name="_ftn_GoBack2"><sup><span class="cs57B87FC4">[3]</span></sup></a></a></span><span class="cs566403DE"> &nbsp;Comrade Khrushchev later proposed to have these [settlements] eliminated, and we were grateful for that.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">You [Russians] have never had faith in the Chinese people, and Stalin was among the worst. &nbsp;The Chinese [Communists] were regarded as Tito the Second; [the Chinese people] were considered as a backward nation. &nbsp;You [Russians] have often stated that the Europeans looked down upon the Russians. &nbsp;I believe that some Russians look down upon the Chinese people.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">At the most critical juncture [of the Chinese revolution], Stalin did not allow us to carry out our revolution and opposed our carrying out the revolution. &nbsp;He made a huge mistake on this issue. &nbsp;So did [Grigory Y.] Zinoviev.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">Neither were we pleased with [Anastas] Mikoyan. &nbsp;He flaunted his seniority and treated us as if [we were] his sons. &nbsp;He put on airs and looked very arrogant. &nbsp;He assumed the greatest airs when he first visited Xibaipo in 1949<a href="#_ftn3"><a name="_ftn_GoBack3"><sup><span class="cs57B87FC4">[4]</span></sup></a></a></span><span class="cs566403DE"> and has been like that every time he came to China. &nbsp;Every time he came, he would urge me to visit Moscow. &nbsp;I asked &nbsp;him what for. &nbsp;He would then say that there was always something for you to do there. &nbsp;Nevertheless, only until later when Comrade Khrushchev proposed to hold a conference to work out a resolution [concerning the relationship among all the communist parties and socialist states] did [I go to Moscow].<a href="#_ftn4"><a name="_ftn_GoBack4"><sup><span class="cs57B87FC4">[5]</span></sup></a></a></span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">It was our common duty to commemorate the fortieth anniversary of the October Revolution. &nbsp;Up to that time, as I often pointed out, there had existed no such thing as brotherly relations among all the parties because, [your leaders] merely paid lip service and never meant it; as a result, the relations between [the brotherly] parties can be described as between father and son or between cats and mice. &nbsp;I have raised this issue in my private meetings with Khrushchev and other [Soviet] comrades. &nbsp;They all admitted that such a father-son relationship was not of European but Asian style. &nbsp;Present were Bulganin, Mikoyan, and [M. A.] Suslov. &nbsp;Were you also at the meeting? &nbsp;From the Chinese side, I and Deng Xiaoping were present.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">I was unhappy with Mikoyan&rsquo;s congratulation speech which he delivered at our Eighth National Congress and I deliberately refused to attend that day&rsquo;s meeting as a protest. &nbsp;You did not know that many of our deputies were not happy with [Mikoyan&rsquo;s speech]. &nbsp;Acting as if he was the father, he regarded China as Russia&rsquo;s son.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">China has her own revolutionary traditions, although China&rsquo;s revolution could not have succeeded without the October Revolution, nor without Marxism-Leninism.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">We must learn from the Soviet experiences. &nbsp;We will comply with the commonly accepted principles, especially the nine principles stated in the &ldquo;Moscow Manifesto.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn5"><a name="_ftn_GoBack5"><sup><span class="cs57B87FC4">[6]</span></sup></a></a></span><span class="cs566403DE"> We ought to learn from all the experiences whether they are correct or erroneous. &nbsp;The erroneous lessons included Stalin&rsquo;s metaphysics and dogmatism. &nbsp;He was not totally metaphysical because he had acquired some dialectics in thinking; but a large part of his [thoughts] focused on metaphysics. &nbsp;What you termed as the cult of personality was one [example of his metaphysics]. &nbsp;Stalin loved to assume the greatest airs.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">Although we support the Soviet Union, we won&rsquo;t endorse its mistakes. &nbsp;As for [the differences over] the issue of peaceful evolution, we have never openly discussed [these differences], nor have we published [them] in the newspapers. &nbsp;Cautious as we have been, we choose to exchange different opinions internally. &nbsp;I had discussed them with you before I went to Moscow. &nbsp;While in Moscow, [we assigned] Deng Xiaoping to raise five [controversial] issues. &nbsp;We won&rsquo;t openly talk about them even in the future, because our doing so would hurt Comrade Khrushchev&rsquo;s [political position]. &nbsp;In order to help consolidate his [Khrushchev&rsquo;s] leadership, we decided not to talk about these [controversies], although it does not mean that the justice is not on our side.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">With regard to inter-governmental relations, we remain united and unified up to this date which even our adversaries have conceded. &nbsp;We are opposed to any [act] that is harmful to the Soviet Union. &nbsp;We have objected to all the major criticism that the revisionists and imperialists have massed against the Soviet Union. &nbsp;The Soviet Union has so far done the same thing [for us].</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">When did the Soviets begin to trust us Chinese? &nbsp;At the time when [we] entered the Korean War. &nbsp;From then on, the two countries got closer to one another [than before] and as a result, the 156 aid projects came about. &nbsp;When Stalin was alive, the [Soviet] aid consisted of 141 projects. &nbsp;Comrade Khrushchev later added a few more.<a href="#_ftn6"><a name="_ftn_GoBack6"><sup><span class="cs57B87FC4">[7]</span></sup></a></a></span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">We have held no secrets from you. &nbsp;Because more than one thousand of your experts are working in our country, you are fully aware of the state of our military, political, economic, and cultural affairs. &nbsp;We trust your people, because you are from a socialist country, and you are sons and daughters of Lenin.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">Problems have existed in our relations, but it was mainly Stalin&rsquo;s responsibility. &nbsp;[We] have had three grievances [against Stalin]. &nbsp;The first concerns the two Wang Ming lines. &nbsp;Wang Ming was Stalin&rsquo;s follower. &nbsp;The second was [Stalin&rsquo;s] discouragement of and opposition to our revolution. &nbsp;Even after the dissolution of the Third International, he still issued orders claiming that, if we did not strike a peace deal with Jiang Jieshi, China would risk a grave danger of national elimination.<a href="#_ftn7"><a name="_ftn_GoBack7"><sup><span class="cs57B87FC4">[8]</span></sup></a></a></span><span class="cs566403DE"> &nbsp;Well, for whatever reason, we are not eliminated. &nbsp;The third was during my first visit to Moscow during which Stalin, [V.M.] Molotov, and [Lavrenti] Beria personally attacked me.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">Why did I ask Stalin to send a scholar [to China] to read my works?<a href="#_ftn8"><a name="_ftn_GoBack8"><sup><span class="cs57B87FC4">[9]</span></sup></a></a></span><span class="cs566403DE"> &nbsp;Was it because I so lacked confidence that I would even have to have you read my works? &nbsp;Or was it because I had nothing to do myself? &nbsp;Not a chance! &nbsp;[My real intention] was to get you over to China to see with your own eyes whether China was truly practicing Marxism or only half-hearted toward Marxism.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">Upon your return [to Moscow] you spoke highly of us. &nbsp;Your first comment to Stalin was &ldquo;the Chinese [comrades] are truly Marxists.&rdquo; &nbsp;Nevertheless Stalin remained doubtful. &nbsp;Only when [we entered] the Korean War did he change his view [about us], and so did East European and other brotherly parties drop their doubts [about us].</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">It appears that there are reasons for us to be suspect: &ldquo;First, you opposed Wang Ming; second, you simply insisted on carrying out your revolution regardless of [our] opposition; third, you looked so smart when you went all the way to Moscow desiring Stalin to sign an agreement so that [China] would regain authority over the [Manchurian] railroad.&rdquo; &nbsp;In Moscow it was [I. V.] Kovalev who took care of me with [N. T.] Fedorenko as my interpreter.<a href="#_ftn9"><a name="_ftn_GoBack9"><sup><span class="cs57B87FC4">[10]</span></sup></a></a></span><span class="cs566403DE"> &nbsp;I got so angry that I once pounded on the table. &nbsp;I only had three tasks here [in Moscow], I said to them, the first was to eat, the second was to sleep, and the third was to shit.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">There was a [Soviet] adviser in [our] military academy who, in discussing war cases, would only allow [the Chinese trainees] to talk about those of the Soviet Union, not China&rsquo;s, would only allow them to talk about the ten offensives of the Soviet Army, not [ours] in the Korean War.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">Please allow us to talk about these cases! &nbsp;[Can you imagine] he wouldn&rsquo;t even allow us to talk about [our own war experiences]! &nbsp;For God&rsquo;s sake, we fought wars for twenty-two years; we fought in Korea for three years! &nbsp;Let [me ask] the Central Military Commission to prepare some materials concerning [our war experiences] and give them to Comrade Yudin, of course, if he is interested.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">We did not speak out on some [controversial] issues because we did not want to cause problems in the Sino-Soviet relations. &nbsp;This was particularly true when the Polish Incident broke out. &nbsp;When Poland demanded that all of your specialists go home, Comrade Liu Shaoqi suggested in Moscow that you withdraw some. &nbsp;You accepted [Liu&rsquo;s] suggestion which made the Polish people happy because they then tasted some freedom. &nbsp;At that time we did not raise our problems with your specialists [in China] because, we believe, it would have caused you to be suspicious that we took the advantage [of your crisis situation] to send all the specialists home. &nbsp;We will not send your specialists home; we will not do so even if Poland does so ten more times. &nbsp;We need Soviet aid.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">Once I have persuaded the Polish people that [we all] should learn from the Soviet Union, and that after putting the anti-dogmatism campaign at rest, [they] ought to advocate a &ldquo;learn from the Soviet Union&rdquo; slogan. &nbsp;Who will benefit in learning from the Soviet Union? &nbsp;The Soviet Union or Poland? &nbsp;Of course, it will benefit Poland more.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">Although we shall learn from the Soviet Union, we must first of all take into account our own experiences and mainly rely on our own experiences.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">There should be some agreed limits on the terms of [Soviet] specialists. &nbsp;For instance, there have never been restrictions on your chief advisers in [our] military and public security branches, who can come and go without even notifying or consulting with us in advance. &nbsp;Presumably, if you leave your post, is it all right that another ambassador be sent [to China] without discussing it with us? &nbsp;No, absolutely not! &nbsp;How much information could your advisers to our ministry of public security obtain if they merely sit there totally uninformed by their Chinese colleagues?</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">Let me advise you [and your specialists] to pay more visits to each of our provinces so as to get in touch with the people and obtain first-hand information. &nbsp;This have I mentioned to Comrade Yudin many times: &nbsp;if not ten thousand times, at least one thousand times!</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">With some exceptions, though, most of the [Soviet] specialists are of a good quality. &nbsp;We have also made mistakes before: we did not take the initiative to pass on information to the Soviet comrades. &nbsp;Now we must correct these mistakes by adopting a more active attitude [toward the Soviet comrades]. &nbsp;Next time [we] ought to introduce to them China&rsquo;s general line. &nbsp;If the first time [we] fail to get the information through, [we] will try a second time, third time, and so forth.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">Indeed, it was [your] proposition for establishing a &ldquo;cooperative&rdquo; on nuclear submarines which led to these remarks. &nbsp;Now that we&rsquo;ve decided not to build our nuclear submarines, we are withdrawing our request [for obtaining submarines from the Soviet Union]. &nbsp;Otherwise, we would have to let you have the entire coast, much larger areas than [what you used to control in] L&uuml;shun and Dalian. &nbsp;Either way, however, we will not get mixed up with you: we must be independent from one another. &nbsp;Since we will in the end build our own flotilla, it is not in our interest that [we] play a minor role in this regard.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">Certainly [the arrangements] will be totally different in war time. &nbsp;Your army can operate in our [land], and our army can move to your places to fight. &nbsp;If your army operates on our territory, however, it must be commanded by us. &nbsp;When our army fights in your land, as long as it does not outnumber your army, it has to be directed by you.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">These remarks of mine may not sound so pleasing to your ear. &nbsp;You may accuse me of being an nationalist or another Tito. &nbsp;My counter argument is that you have extended Russian nationalism to China&rsquo;s coast.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">It was Comrade Khrushchev who had eliminated the four joint enterprises. &nbsp;Before his death, Stalin demanded the right to build a plant to manufacture canned food in our country. &nbsp;My response was that [we] would accept [the demand] as long as you provide us equipment, help us build it, and import all the products [from us]. &nbsp;Comrade Khrushchev praised me for giving [Stalin] a good answer. &nbsp;But why in the world do [you Russians] want to build a naval &ldquo;cooperative&rdquo; now? &nbsp;How would you explain to the rest of the world that you propose to build a naval &ldquo;cooperative&rdquo;? How would you explain to the Chinese people? &nbsp;For the sake of struggling against the imperialists, you may, as advisers, train the Chinese people. &nbsp;Otherwise, you would have to lease L&uuml;shun and other [ports] for ninety-nine years; but your &ldquo;cooperative&rdquo; proposal involves the question of ownership, as you propose that each side will own fifty percent of it. &nbsp;Yesterday you made me so enraged that I could not sleep at all last night. &nbsp;They (pointing at other CCP leaders present) are not angry. &nbsp;Only me alone! &nbsp;If this is wrong, it will be my sole responsibility.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">(Zhou Enlai: Our Politburo has unanimously agreed upon these points.)</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">If we fail to get our messages through this time, we may have to arrange another meeting; if not, we may have to meet every day. &nbsp;Still, I can go to Moscow to speak to Comrade Khrushchev; or we can invite Comrade Khrushchev to come to Beijing so as to clarify every issue.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">(Peng Dehuai: This year Soviet Defense Minister Malinovsky cabled me requesting to build a long-wave radio station along China&rsquo;s coast to direct the [Soviet] submarine flotilla in the Pacific Ocean. &nbsp;As the project will cost a total of 110 million rubles, the Soviet Union will cover 70 million and China will pay 40 million.)</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">This request is of the same nature as the naval &ldquo;cooperative&rdquo; proposal which [we] cannot explain to the people. &nbsp;[We] will be put in a politically disadvantageous position if [we] reveal these requests to the world.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">(Peng Dehuai: &nbsp;Petroshevskii [a Soviet military adviser] also has a rude attitude and rough style. &nbsp;He is not very pleased because some of our principles for army building do not completely follow the Soviet military codes. &nbsp;Once at an enlarged CMC meeting, when Comrade Ye Fei from the Fujian Military District<a href="#_ftn10"><a name="_ftn_GoBack10"><sup><span class="cs57B87FC4">[11]</span></sup></a></a></span><span class="cs566403DE"> pointed out that, as the Soviet military codes were basically to guide operations on flatlands, and as Fujian [province] had nothing but mountains, the Soviet codes were not entirely applicable [to Fujian&rsquo;s reality]. &nbsp;Very upset at hearing this, Petroshevskii immediately responded: &ldquo;You have insulted the great military science invented by the great Stalin!&rdquo; &nbsp;His remarks made everyone at the meeting very nervous.)</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">Some of the above-mentioned [controversial] issues have been raised [by us] before, some have not. &nbsp;You have greatly aided us but now we are downplaying your [role]; you may feel very bad about it. &nbsp;Our relationship, however, resembles that between professor and student: &nbsp;the professor may make mistakes, do not you agree that the student has to point them out? &nbsp;Pointing out mistakes does not mean that the [student] will drive the professor out. &nbsp;After all the professor is a good one.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">You are assisting us to build a navy! &nbsp;Your [people] can serve as advisers. &nbsp;Why would you have to have fifty percent of the ownership? &nbsp;This is a political issue. &nbsp;We plan to build two or three hundred submarines of this kind.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">If you insist on attaching political conditions [to our submarine request], we will not satisfy you at all, not even give you a tiny [piece of our] finger. &nbsp;You may inform Comrade Khrushchev that, if [he] still [insists on] these conditions, there is no point for us to talk about this issue. &nbsp;If he accepts our requirement, he may come [to Beijing]; if not, he does not have to come, because there is nothing for us to talk about. &nbsp;Even one tiny condition is unacceptable [for us]!</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">When this issue is involved, we will refuse to accept your aid for ten thousand years. &nbsp;However, it is still possible for us to cooperate on many other affairs; it is unlikely that we would break up. &nbsp;We will, from beginning to the end, support the Soviet Union, although we may quarrel with each other inside the house.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">While I was in Moscow, I once made it clear to Comrade Khrushchev that you did not have to satisfy every one of our requests. &nbsp;Because if you hold back your aid from us, [you] in effect would compel us to work harder [to be self-reliant]; should we get everything from you, we will end up in an disadvantageous position.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">It is, however, extremely important for us to cooperate politically. &nbsp;Because, if we undermine your political positions, you will encounter considerable problems; the same is true with us: if you undermine our [political] positions, we will be in trouble.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">In wartime, you can utilize all our naval ports, military bases, and other [facilities]. &nbsp;[In return] our [military] can operate in your places including your port or bases at Vladivostok and shall return home when war is over. &nbsp;We may sign an agreement on wartime cooperation in advance which does not have to wait until war breaks out. &nbsp;Such an agreement must contain a stipulation that our [forces] can operate on your territory; even if we might not do so, such a stipulation is required, because it involves the issue of equality. &nbsp;In peacetime, however, such an arrangement cannot be accepted. &nbsp;In peacetime, you are only to help us construct [military] bases and build armed forces.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">We would not have accepted [your] proposition for building a naval &ldquo;cooperative&rdquo;

Allegedly, in 1957-1958, Soviet military and naval advisors in China repeatedly made suggestions to the Chinese that they should purchase new naval equipment from the Soviet Union. On 28 June 1958, Zhou Enlai wrote to Khrushchev, requesting that the Soviet Union provide technological assistance for China&rsquo;s naval buildup, especially the designs for new-type submarines. On 21 July 1958, Yudin called on Mao Zedong. Invoking Khrushchev&rsquo;s name, Yudin told Mao that the geography of the Soviet Union made it difficult for it to take full advantage of the new-type submarines. Because China had a long coastline and good natural harbors, the Soviets proposed that China and the Soviet Union establish a joint submarine flotilla. Mao Zedong made the following response: &ldquo;First, we should make clear the guiding principle.[Do you mean that] we should create [the flotilla] with your assistance? Or [do you mean] that we should jointly create [the flotilla], otherwise you will not offer any assistance?&rdquo; Mao emphasized that he was not interested in creating a Sino-Soviet &ldquo;military cooperative.&rdquo; (Source: &nbsp;Han Nianlong et al. Dangdai zhongguo waijiao, 113-114.) The next day, Mao discussed the proposal with Yudin at length.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE"><a href="#_ftn_GoBack1"><a name="_ftn1"><sup><span class="cs9D6B947E">[2]</span></sup></a></a></span><span class="cs9A2F8768"> Mao referred to Zhou Enlai and Peng Dehuai who were present during this discussion.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE"><a href="#_ftn_GoBack2"><a name="_ftn2"><sup><span class="cs9D6B947E">[3]</span></sup></a></a></span><span class="cs9A2F8768"> In March 1950 and July 1951, the Chinese and Soviet government signed four agreements, establishing a civil aviation company, an oil company, a non-ferrous and rare metal company, and a shipbuilding company jointly owned by the two countries.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE"><a href="#_ftn_GoBack3"><a name="_ftn3"><sup><span class="cs9D6B947E">[4]</span></sup></a></a></span><span class="cs9A2F8768"> Xibaipo was tiny village in Hebei Province where the Chinese Communist Party maintained headquarters from mid 1948 to early 1949.
