Two of those who became ill have died.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Currently an investigation is being carried out and the reasons for their deaths are being clarified. Thus far, it has not been conclusively determined whether they were infected by the bacillus carriers mentioned above.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">To meet the urgent needs of the front, we have already sent sanitation squads to combat these diseases and by air have delivered to the front some 3.4 million doses of vaccine against plague and cholera, as well as 4,000 pounds of powder to kill insects.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Secret information and press reports obtained by us confirm that the American imperialists in Korea have systematically and deliberately disseminated the bacilli carriers.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Three of the five prominent Japanese war criminals involved in bacteriological warfare who were mentioned in the Soviet Government&rsquo;s note of 1 February 1950 &mdash; namely, Ishii Shiro, Wakamatsu Yujiro and Kitano Masajo&mdash; are currently in Korea. They took with them all the equipment necessary to conduct bacteriological warfare, including bacilli carriers of cholera and plague as well as gases that act to destroy human blood, and also a variety of equipment to disseminate the bacilli carriers.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Under the auspices of the Americans, Japanese war criminals with knowledge of bacteriological warfare are using Chinese and Korean prisoners of war for testing of bacteriological weapons. These war criminals compiled a report on how bacteriological weapons are being used during military operations in winter conditions.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">In March 1951 the chief of department of medical welfare under the General Staff of the UN forces, Brigadier-General [Crawford] Sams arrived at the port Genzan on Bacterio-Assault Landing Craft No. 1091, and then he visited Kyoseyto Island, where bacteriological weapons were tested on Chinese and Korean prisoners of war under his guidance and supervision. This was reported on 18 May 18, 1951 by an American correspondent for the Associated Press agency who visited Kyoseyto Island. On this occasion the enemy&#39;s actions aimed at disseminating bacilli carriers were similar to the actions and methods used by war criminals with knowledge of bacteriological warfare Ishii Shiro as well as other Japanese war criminals responsible for bacteriological warfare during the Sino-Japanese War.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">On behalf of the Minister of Foreign Affairs first of [North] Korea and then of China, we intend to appeal to the whole world with a protest against the criminal actions of American imperialism, which has embarked on bacteriological warfare in Korea. &nbsp;The All-China Committee of Partisans for Peace will appeal to the World Council of Partisans for Peace with a proposal to launch a campaign against the criminal actions of the American imperialists, who have embarked on bacteriological warfare in Korea.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">We are reporting to you about this, and we hope that the Soviet Government will provide us with effective help, and we also hope to receive your instructions about this matter.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">With greetings,</span></p><p class="cs7C1F8B9D"><span class="cs566403DE">MAO ZEDONG</span></p></span>
