If the enemy insists on exchanging territory in the area of Kaesong for territory in areas south of Kaesong and [Kindzyo] then it will be advantageous for us to simply offer a draft to cease hostilities where the front line is at present, to establish a southern and northern boundary of the withdrawal of the troops of both sides at two kilometers, and force the enemy to accept this draft and not have further arguments about the issue of exchanging territory.</span></p><p class="cs1DD73BED"><span class="cs566403DE">MAO ZEDONG 0130 31 October&quot;</span></p><p class="cs1DD73BED"><span class="cs566403DE">MAO ZEDONG</span></p><p class="csFF2B8F43"><span class="cs566403DE">N&ordm; 5422</span></p><p class="csFF2B8F43"><span class="cs566403DE">1 November 1951</span></p><p class="cs4F31DC91"><span class="cs566403DE">---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- </span></p><p class="cs4F31DC91"><span class="cs566403DE">Deciphered by Araushkin 1840 1 November</span></p><p class="csF92C65F7"><span class="cs566403DE">Printed by Leshevich &nbsp;1930 1 November</span></p><p class="csF92C65F7"><span class="cs566403DE">N&ordm; 1889</span></p><p class="csF92C65F7"><span class="cs566403DE">Eleven copies printed.
