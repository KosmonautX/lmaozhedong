Li Kenong of 0530 18 October 1951 for [your] information.</span></p><p class="csC6785AFF"><span class="cs566403DE">&quot;Cde. Le Kenong, copy to Cdes. Kim Il Sung and Peng Dehuai. I have received your telegram of 0115 18 October.</span></p><p class="csB9C62841"><span class="cs566403DE">At the present time at the meeting of liaison officers our side should keep to an approach which promotes the rapid resumption of the work of the conference. We should both not be in a hurry and not waste time.</span></p><p class="csC6ADC4EB"><span class="cs566403DE">We should at our initiative and at an opportune moment propose means with which both sides could agree in order to solve some secondary issues.</span></p><p class="csC3FDFDC4"><span class="cs566403DE">As regards measures or secondary issues which we intend to change we should not make changes right away; at the same time we should not reveal at the first meetings or in the press that our point of view is absolutely inflexible. On the contrary, we should prepare the ground for a subsequent change so that at the moment the change is made it does not appear sudden, as if we are making a big concession.</span></p><p class="csB60FD7E3"><span class="cs566403DE">Therefore your intention of giving instructions to correspondents to place a report in the press that the proposal our side has offered about the reduction of the Kaesong-Bunsan neutral zone and the neutral strip along the road between these points is a great concession is extremely inadvisable.</span></p><p class="csF92C65F7"><span class="cs566403DE">The proposal we have offered is not any serious concession.</span></p><p class="csF747CCFF"><span class="cs566403DE">In the event that the enemy does not agree we intend to reduce the neutral zone still further. Will this be a still greater concession after the great concession that was made? It is politically disadvantageous to make such a statement in the press this way.</span></p><p class="csE8511226"><span class="cs566403DE">In reality, in the opinion of the enemy the move of the conference to [Hamonten], the responsibility of both sides for security, and the expansion of the neutral zone to Bunsan has not given them anything good.</span></p><p class="csE8511226"><span class="cs566403DE">On the contrary, in this event enemy aircraft cannot fly over Bunsan, which is not in the enemy&#39;s interests. Therefore, since 7 October all the enemy press and public opinion has not considered this a concession by us, but on the contrary they note that there will be more trouble at [Hamonten] than at Kaesong.</span></p><p class="cs6E6E78D8"><span class="cs566403DE">As regards the enemy, as before he is interested in using the meeting of liaison officers in order to stall for time and conduct intelligence.</span></p><p class="csE8511226"><span class="cs566403DE">We should also act cautiously in order not to reveal our plans, which is to our advantage during the subsequent struggle at the conference.</span></p><p class="csB841DFC4"><span class="cs566403DE">However, of the four alternatives proposed by the enemy it is apparent that the enemy is increasingly disinclined to reject the resumption of the work of the conference.</span></p><p class="csF92C65F7"><span class="cs566403DE">Please be guided by my instructions.</span></p><p class="cs1729CCFB"><span class="cs566403DE">MAO ZEDONG 0530 18 October&quot;</span></p><p class="csF92C65F7"><span class="cs566403DE">N&ordm; 5205</span></p><p class="cs4226D5C"><span class="cs566403DE">19 October</span></p><p class="cs72FADA97"><span class="cs566403DE">MAO ZEDONG</span></p><p class="csCA5BF648"><span class="cs566403DE">---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- </span></p><p class="csCA5BF648"><span class="cs566403DE">Deciphered by Fedyaev 1205 19 October</span></p><p class="csF92C6616"><span class="cs566403DE">Printed by Kornyushina 1250 19 October N&ordm; 3007</span></p><p class="csF92C6616"><span class="cs566403DE">Eight copies printed</span></p><p class="cs1EAC6F65"><span class="cs566403DE">Verified: Section Chief Colonel</span></p><p class="cs5A102A52"><span class="cs566403DE">[signature] (Makarov)</span></p></span>
