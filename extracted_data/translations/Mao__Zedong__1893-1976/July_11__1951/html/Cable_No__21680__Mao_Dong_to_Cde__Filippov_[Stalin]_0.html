Everyone undoubtedly knows this. Until achievement of an agreement by both sides about the conditions for a cessation of military operations hostilities may continue as before in all areas except the neutral zone created by agreement of both sides. The delegation of UN headquarters forces is ready to exert its efforts to realize a cessation of hostilities and of the creation of military conditions which ensure the resumption of hostilities. Our delegation came here just to achieve this common goal. The delegation will only discuss military issues of Korea alone. Our delegation will not discuss any political or economic issues and will also not discuss military issues unrelated to Korea.</span></p><p class="cs25E42B3A"><span class="cs566403DE">The success and failure of the negotiations which have begun today will depend on the realistic intentions of those delegations present here. If both sides have sincere intentions an atmosphere of mutual understanding can be created. If there is such an atmosphere we have good reason to hope for success. There is such an atmosphere where truth prevails.</span></p><p class="csE8511226"><span class="cs566403DE">As head of the UN forces delegation and as the immediate representative of the Commander-in-Chief of the UN forces I want to clearly state that the UN delegation has the most sincere intentions so that every person have this in mind if he is not intent on consciously creating misunderstanding.</span></p><p class="csBA6FA721"><span class="cs566403DE">We think that the representatives of the Korean and Chinese armies will act in the same way.
