Our representatives submitted for consideration the agenda indicated in the previous telegram and criticized the agenda offered by the enemy representatives.</span></p><p class="csB841E021"><span class="cs566403DE">The enemy representatives agreed to submit for discussion points 1, 4, and 5 which we had proposed, however they vigorously opposed point 3, which provides for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea. They explained this by the fact that foreign troops were sent by various countries and therefore this issue can only be discussed with the consent of the governments of the various countries and the UN. They repeatedly asked questions about this point.</span></p><p class="csB5790F10"><span class="cs566403DE">Finally, the enemy representatives moved to minor issues (for example, freedom of communications) in order to stall for time and not reveal their platform.</span></p><p class="cs37C823D2"><span class="cs566403DE">They took the draft of our agenda with them for discussion. In addition, the enemy representatives offered a proposal to increase the number of support personnel to 120, including 20 correspondents.</span></p><p class="cs6E6E78D8"><span class="cs566403DE">As regards the arrival of correspondents we politely declined because we are not prepared for this.</span></p><p class="csBA6FA721"><span class="cs566403DE">In the afternoon the atmosphere was good.
