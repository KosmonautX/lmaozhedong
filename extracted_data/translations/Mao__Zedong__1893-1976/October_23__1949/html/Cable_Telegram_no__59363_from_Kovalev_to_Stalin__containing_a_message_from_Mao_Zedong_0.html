FILIPPOV.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">I am sending you information received by our information organization in TIANJIN:</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">1. On 25 June the Fatherland Front of KOREA made a decision about holding general elections in the country on 20 October.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">This decision was made at a moment when peace talks between the CPC and the Kuomintang were broken off, but units of the PLA had forced the Yangtze River and occupied the cities of SHANGHAI, NANKING, etc. These events raised the mood and morale of the population of South KOREA.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">At the same time the democratic leaders of North and South KOREA thought that this political offensive is a precondition of a military offensive which should be conducted in October. Their leadership also thought this was its strategic goal and therefore planned their work in this direction and sent large groups of cadre to South KOREA to perform underground work in order to prepare an action [</span><span class="csC98BA9AD">vystuplenie</span><span class="cs566403DE">] in October.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">The Worker&rsquo;s Party of KOREA has actively mobilized the popular masses to support this struggle. The population of South KOREA also thought that the time was already ripe to display its loyal attitude. Thus both the progressive and also sympathetic elements were inspired to take part in the struggle. They either sheltered and protected revolutionary leaders or gave active support &ndash; they prepared for the action on time. At that time this fact forced SYNGMAN RHEE to abandon the forcible implementation of the military service law. </span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">2. However, only minor clashes occurred during July at the 38</span><sup><span class="cs6D6FB01F">th</span></sup><span class="cs566403DE"> parallel, and by October complete calm was observed.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">A fourth session of the supreme council of the popular assembly was convened in North KOREA in October at which a fundamental amendment to the previously planned line was introduced.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Explanations were made about this among senior officials that the goal of the political offensive had already been achieved, and inasmuch as South KOREA is not acting, therefore it is also not right for North KOREA to make the first shot. But this explanation was not made among low-level officials.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">3. The population of South KOREA was extremely disappointed as a result of all of this. Many think that the Worker&rsquo;s Party had deceived them.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">The majority of officials sent to South KOREA from North KOREA were unmasked [or] compromised. The unworthy of them went over to the side of the enemy, but the sympathizers drew back.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">The reactionaries began reprisals in South KOREA beginning with the second half of October: almost all the members of the city committee of the Worker&rsquo;s Party in SEOUL were arrested, thus its main position in South KOREA collapsed.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">The majority of the remaining senior officials from the CC of the Worker&rsquo;s Party were also arrested except PAK [HYUNG-SIK] and some other people who sold out to the enemy.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">4. At the present time discussions about the political line have begun inside the Worker&rsquo;s Party and the Fatherland Front.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Both the revolutionary officials as well as sympathizers in South KOREA as well as sympathizers and people who took part in this struggle complain that the political slogans are not being implemented in practice. Now a loss has been inflicted by the enemy which has increased the difficulty in the matter of the unification and incorporation of South KOREA. It is especially sad that almost everything that the officials sent to South KOREA have been lost right now.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">I don&rsquo;t know whether the above information corresponds to reality. But if it does then we ought to pay serious attention to this.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">[Translator&rsquo;s note: the following paragraph was highlighted in the left </span></p><p class="cs7C1F8B9D"><span class="cs566403DE">MAO ZEDONG 21 October 1949&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs2A4A7CB2"><span class="cs566403DE">N&ordm; 234 KOVALEV 23 October</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Deciphered by Finenko at 0840 24 October</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Printed by Doronchenkova at 0920 24 October</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Five copies printed, copy N&ordm; 5 to file</span></p><p class="cs746A5FAB"><span class="cs566403DE">N&ordm; 6998</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Verified by the shift chief &ndash; [illegible signature] 1100</span></p></span>
