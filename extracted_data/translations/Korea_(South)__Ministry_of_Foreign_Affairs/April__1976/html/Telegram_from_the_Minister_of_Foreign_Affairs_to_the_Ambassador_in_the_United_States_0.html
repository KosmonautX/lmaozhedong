For your information, guidelines are delivered to major embassies in Asia, Europe and Americas to let them know the government&rsquo;s stance on the U.S. troop withdrawal from Korea and U.S.&#39;s resultant change in policy on Korea as follows:</span></p><p class="cs3BFD1D18"><span class="cs566403DE">a. In the middle of the current presidential campaign, Jimmy Carter, U.S. Democratic candidate, has once suggested that the U.S. foreign policies on Korea would be likely to change, stating that it would be necessary for the U.S. troops in Korea to phase out. </span></p><p class="cs3BFD1D18"><span class="cs566403DE">b. The U.S. forces are stationed in Korea to in accordance with the U.N. Security Council resolution and the ROK-US Mutual Defense Treaty. The U.S. forces have been effective war deterrence against North Korea, and played an important role in keeping security and power balance in Northeast Asia and the Pacific regions.</span></p><p class="cs3BFD1D18"><span class="cs566403DE">c. Therefore, it is indispensable for U.S. armed forces to continue stationing in Korea at this point; the U.S. withdrawal would take risk of breaking the power balance in the Korean Peninsula and security in Far East.</span></p><p class="cs3BFD1D18"><span class="cs566403DE">d. Under these circumstances, we hope our friendly countries support our stance stated above and cooperate with us. In addition, every nation concerned is encouraged to deliver either directly or indirectly to the U.S. that it is not wise to make light of the U.S. troop withdrawal from Korea.</span></p><p class="cs3BFD1D18"><span class="cs566403DE">e. You are required to work secretly and report frequently based on the following guidelines: </span></p><p class="cs3BFD1D18"><span class="cs566403DE">i. Persuade both authorities in your host country (mainly the ministry of foreign affairs in your host country, or other possible ways, if necessary, under local circumstances.) and influential political figures into stressing the necessity of the U.S. presence in Asia and U.S. forces in Korea to local authorities, such as the U.S. government and Congress, either officially or unofficially at every opportunity.</span></p><p class="cs3BFD1D18"><span class="cs566403DE">ii. Influence the media in your host country so that they claim the above point in the editorials, articles, or other ways. Try to persuade high-ranking personnel or influential public figures in your host country into stating similar opinions frequently and officially so as to appeal to the public.

You are required to have the U.S. government announce that the Carter administration would keep the same policy toward Korea as the previous ones at appropriate time and way, work tactfully in order to affect public opinion into such points, and report the outcomes at any times.
