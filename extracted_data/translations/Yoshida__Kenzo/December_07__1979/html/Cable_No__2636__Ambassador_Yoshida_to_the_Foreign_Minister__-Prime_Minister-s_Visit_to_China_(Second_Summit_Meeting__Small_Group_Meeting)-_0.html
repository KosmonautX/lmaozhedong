Prime Minister Ohira described how useful the morning&#39;s meeting with Vice Premier Deng had been. In response, Premier Hua said that he felt the same way and, having already heard what had been discussed, would not repeat that discussion. </span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">2. Prime Minister Ohira, saying that he had raised points (1) and (2) below with Vice Premier Deng and that he would like to reiterate them with Premier Hua, spoke as follows.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">(1) It was very useful to hear Vice Premier Deng&#39;s description of China&#39;s global vision in its understanding of and strategy in regard to the Indochinese peninsula. Our country&#39;s consistent position has been that international conflicts should be resolved by peaceful means and, on the basis of such a position, we have made proposals concerning the Indochinese conflict as well to your country and relevant countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, regarding our country&#39;s aid to Vietnam, we have to honor our commitment. We would like to decide when to do so in judging ourselves the various circumstances.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">(2) Concerning relations between Japan and Taiwan, we obtained from the Chinese side at the time of Japan and China&#39;s normalization of relations the understanding that we would maintain non-governmental relations with Taiwan. We have continued them to this day. Our country is not thinking as our policy to expand those working relations and has no thought to violate the framework of the Japan-China Joint Communique. &nbsp;We would like you to understand the increase in the quantity of those working relations as happening merely as &quot;natural growth.&quot; In any event, we will consult with the Chinese side when we are going to do something major. </span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">(3) On the Korean issue, Premier Hua said yesterday that China also approves of endeavoring to create an international environment conducive to North-South dialogue. Our two countries have a common position on this point. Prime Minister Ohira next touched on the democratization of the Republic of Korea (ROK), saying that its foremost requirement is the promotion of dialogue. The Government of Japan considers that the paths that various countries follow are for those countries themselves to decide and that third countries should follow those choices. We think that the ROK Government is making efforts towards democratization. We also think it would be reassuring if your country, hereafter and as necessary, would encourage North Korean self-restraint.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">3. &nbsp;Next, Premier Hua made the following comments:</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">(1) China has praised Japan&#39;s temporary halt in aid to Vietnam. China considers giving aid to Vietnam, at a time when it has invaded another country, disagreeable for countries, such as the ASEAN countries, threatened by Vietnam. It is for Japan to decide when to carry out what it has promised but, as Japan has good relations with the ASEAN countries, China thinks that it would be good to proceed in seeking the views of the ASEAN countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">(2) Concerning relations between Japan and Taiwan, I am happy with what Prime Minister Ohira has said. Prime Minister Ohira has said that Japan, in observing the framework Japan-China Joint Communique, would like China to understand the existence of relations between Japan and Taiwan as working relations at the non-governmental level and their mere &quot;natural growth.&quot; Of course, that is something that we can understand. Also, I am very happy to hear Prime Minister Ohira say that Japan would inform and consult with us in advance of major acts. That such discussion is possible is, I think, an expression of how very well relations between China and Japan are going. </span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">(3) Concerning the Korean issue, I would like China, Japan, and the United States to work together to influence Korea and create an environment for the promotion of dialogue and the realization of an independent and peaceful reunification. I believe that North Korea&#39;s moving south by force will absolutely not happen. Furthermore, Kim Il Sung has said that when peaceful reunification is realized, a non-aligned and neutral Korea will be established. This would be beneficial to peace in Asia. If it were to happen, the Soviet Union would find it difficult to make a move, even if it tried.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">(End)</span></p></span>
