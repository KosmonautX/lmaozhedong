These two requests are in accord with the spirit of the Sino-Soviet treaty. &nbsp;Our side has agreed. &nbsp;As to the detailed means, after discussion with Roshchin, the following agreement was reached: concerning rail transport, no matter whether (they) enter the country from Manzhouli or the Suifen River via Haerbin, Changchun and Shenyang to L&uuml;da, or to Andong and then to Korea, Yu Guangsheng will need to be informed in advance by either the Soviet side&rsquo;s Vice-Chair of the Chinese Changchun Railway&rsquo;s Administrative Committee or the Soviet side&rsquo;s Chinese Changchun Railway Bureau Director so that vehicles can be dispatched in time to avoid holding things up. &nbsp;Our side authorizes Yu Guangsheng to handle this and report to the Railway Department in a timely manner. &nbsp;Concerning the air transport question, the Soviet side has decided to utilize the Shenyang Aviation Institute to augment Soviet personnel, strengthen ground-air communications and report on Soviet planes crossing the border, to avoid any misunderstanding. &nbsp;On our side, the Military Commission has decided to transfer Duan Suquan to (the position) of Northeast Region Air Force Commander, and has instructed Duan Suquan to establish contact immediately with the Soviet advisor at the Shengyang Aviation Institute and to report in a timely manner to the Military Commission Air Force Headquarters.</span><span class="cs446E8E06"> &nbsp;</span></p><p class="csE6BD2737"><span class="cs566403DE">[Chinese Communist] Party Central Committee</span></p><p class="csE6BD2737"><span class="cs566403DE">July 11</span></p></span>
