			<li class="cs190C785"><span class="cs5EFED22F">As the international revisionists line up with the imperialists and reactionaries to oppose China and the world&rsquo;s people, the Korean [Workers&rsquo;] Party is standing firmly with us. We are loyal comrades in arms, and the relations between our two countries are excellent&mdash;it is [a relationship] of mutual assistance. Therefore, when we handle issues related to [North] Korea, we should take them seriously. We must handle these issues well and we cannot make mistakes. The counties and districts and foreign affairs, public security, border defense and customs work units where ethnic Koreans and Korean immigrants live should strengthen education about proletarian internationalism and Sino-Korean friendship.</span></li></ol>

We will not make additional restrictions. As for the [North] Korean nationals who requested to return to [North] Korea, we will approve each of these requests.</span></li></ol>
