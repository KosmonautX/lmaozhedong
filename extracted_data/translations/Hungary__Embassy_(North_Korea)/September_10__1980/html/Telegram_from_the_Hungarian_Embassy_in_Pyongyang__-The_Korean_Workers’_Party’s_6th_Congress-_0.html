In other words, guidance is from &ldquo;The Great Leader&rdquo; and Kim Jong Il is the executive leader. The referent added that this practice will be phrased publicly in some form during the congress.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">Answering to my question regarding the &ldquo;hundred-day battle&rdquo;, he said that his personal responsibility is to study the Korean-Hungarian relations in depth, make suggestions for eliminating fallbacks, and evaluate the existing situation in various fields.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">An open question for him was &ldquo;why our party relations had regressed with such a great extent in the last two years&rdquo;. He added that he cannot provide a satisfying answer in this matter to his urging leaders.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">I pointed out in my response to Comrade Bang that the Hungarian Workers&rsquo; Party&rsquo;s practice is not to engage in mere formalities and idling. Our party, as I said, welcomes collaboration frameworks that can be filled with meaningful content. My belief is, I added, that if the Korean side can provide these, then we will be able to establish a more fruitful program of cooperation than the current one.</span></p><p class="cs2A4A7CB2"><span class="cs566403DE">&ndash; 160 &ndash; charge d&rsquo;affaires &ndash;</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">To be seen by</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Comrade Szab&oacute; F.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Seen by</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Comrade B&eacute;nyei</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Comrade R&aacute;tkai</span></p></span>
