He said the following concerning the 4th Party Congress:</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">Great changes have taken place in the party and the country since 1956 March, since the 3rd Congress of the Workers&rsquo; Party. Men are no longer exploiting other men, the socialist production way has been victorious in all areas of the economy. The country has a significant socialist industry, and they have finished the socialist transformation of agriculture as well. They have successfully completed the first five-year plan before its deadline; other sister countries have provided great support for this as well. Fractions inside the party have been eliminated, unity has been solidified. The whole working nation is firmly gathering around the Central Committee led by Comrade Kim Il Sung; the party&rsquo;s &ldquo;direction of the masses&rdquo; and &ldquo;people-centric workstyle&rdquo; policies have triumphed. There seems to be advancements in the issue of unifying the country as well, the South Korean people have chased away Rhee Syngman, and demanding the reunification without any foreign influences more and more actively. The South Korean colonial rule of the American imperialism is facing a catastrophe.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">The 4th Congress of the Workers&rsquo; Party &ndash; said Comrade Pak &ndash; will be the &ldquo;</span><span class="csA0E9A871">congress of victors</span><span class="cs566403DE">&rdquo; that summarizes the results achieved so far, and determines the next goals.

(See my no. 472 open telegram.)</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">Please forward my report to the leader comrades.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Pr&aacute;th K&aacute;roly<br>Ambassador</span></p></span>
