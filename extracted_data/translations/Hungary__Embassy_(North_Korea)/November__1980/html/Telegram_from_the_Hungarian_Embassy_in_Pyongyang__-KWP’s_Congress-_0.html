(The agenda involves the modification of the Party Rules.)</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">According to a night broadcast of the South Korean radio that is aimed at the North, Kim Jong Il is the one behind taking custody of the &ldquo;anti-party elements&rdquo;. For example Comrade Kim Dong-gyu, former member of the Central Committee Politburo, and former foreign secretary of the Central Committee, was arrested in 1977 on his instructions. (Comrade Kim Dong-gyu had good relations with the Vietnamese leaders.) I looked into similar statements of the South Korean radio, and except for their propagandistic statements, factually they are mostly true.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">Monitoring the internal political life of the DPRK, it is apparent that a new movement has started in the recent few months: &ldquo;learn from the examples of unanimous heroes&rdquo;. In the framework of preparing for the congress, this movement is linked with the &ldquo;three red flag movement&rdquo;, which was initiated and advocated by Kim Il Sung&rsquo;s son.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">In relation with the aforementioned, I would like to highlight the contents of my no. 135 open telegram.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">Based on conversations with our Soviet friends as well, I think it is likely that there has been no decision so far in appointing Kim Jong Il as the official successor. This is currently only in a preparatory stage. (According to my information, Kim Il Sung did not say anything concrete during the last Central Committee session about how the Korean Workers&rsquo; Party&rsquo;s Party Rules should be modified.)</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">It is also worthy to note that according to my information, O Jin-u is in a very good relationship with Kim Jong Il.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">I am asking that only the leaders concerned should be informed about the aforementioned, the apparatus should not be yet.</span></p><p class="cs2A4A7CB2"><span class="cs566403DE">&ndash; 42 &ndash;&ndash;E. &ndash;</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">To be seen by Comrade Szab&oacute; Ferenc</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Seen by Comrade R&aacute;tkai</span></p></span>
