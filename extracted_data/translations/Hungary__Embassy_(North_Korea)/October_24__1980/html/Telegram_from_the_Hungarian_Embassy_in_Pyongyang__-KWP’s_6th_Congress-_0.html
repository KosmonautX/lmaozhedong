(Our friends have also experienced the disabilities in the guidance of the colleagues assigned to the delegations as well.)</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">Our Vietnamese friends disliked the fact that their delegation could not participate in the grand meeting, and that recently the Korean press reported the greeting telegram of Pol Pot that he addressed to Kim Il Sung on the occasion of the 35th anniversary of the KWP&rsquo;s foundation. (The local Pol Pot-ist ambassador attended the congress along with the other mission leaders.)</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">The Vietnamese and Cuban comrades expressed their dissatisfaction about the low rank of the Korean leaders accompanying and hosting them. The leader of the Polish delegation asked to be received by Kim Il Sung in order to be able to inform him about the Polish situation. The meeting could have been possible if Comrade Wojtaszek had stayed after the congress. This was not feasible for the Polish comrades.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">Friendly embassies are also analyzing the published congress materials, but our work is complicated by the fact that the documents, besides the Central Committee report proposed by Kim Il Sung, are only available in Korean.</span></p><p class="cs2A4A7CB2"><span class="cs566403DE">&ndash; 176 E. &ndash;</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">To be seen by</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Comrade Szab&oacute; F.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Comrade Bobvos</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Seen by</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Comrade B&eacute;nyei</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Comrade R&aacute;tkai</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Comrade Ill&eacute;s</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Comrade Ze&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;k</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Comrade Nyecki</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Comrade Kop&aacute;nyi</span></p></span>
