    <p>ALL-UNION COMMUNIST PARTY (bolsheviks), CENTRAL COMMITTEE<br/><br/>No. P84/422 Copies: Comrades Malenkov, Molotov, Gromyko<br/><br/>19 November 1951<br/><br/>Excerpt from protocol No. 84 of the meeting of the Politburo CC VKP(b) [Central  Committee, All-Union Communist Party (bol'shevik)]<br/><br/>Decision of 19 November 1951<br/>422. Telegram of Comrade Razuvaev<br/>No. 1352.<br/><br/>To adopt the attached draft instruction to Comrade Razuvaev.<br/><br/>SECRETARY CC<br/><br/>To p.422(op) pr.PB No. 84<br/>Top Secret<br/>Top Priority<br/><br/>NORTH KOREA<br/><br/>To RAZUVAEV<br/><br/>1352. From your telegram it is not clear in connection with what and on whose initiative the question arose about an appeal by the government of the DPRK to the General Assembly and the Security Council with a demand concerning a speeding up of the resolution of the Korean question. It is also not clear how the Chinese friends regard this, since you do not communicate anything about this in your telegram.<br/><br/>An appeal by the government of the DPRK to the General Assembly and to the Security Council as it is set forth in your telegram: about the immediate cessation of military operations in Korea, about the withdrawal of troops along the front line and the creation of a two kilometer demilitarization zone and about making answerable those guilty of prolonging the war in Korea, could be evaluated in the present situation, in conditions of blackmail by the Americans, as a sign of weakness on the Chinese-Korean side, which is politically disadvantageous.<br/><br/>Therefore, not having the text of the appeal, not knowing the opinion of the Chinese comrades and not knowing the motives which are guiding the Korean friends, we consider it necessary that you advise the Korean friends to set aside resolution of the question of an appeal until the elucidation of the aforementioned questions.<br/><br/>We await a more detailed report from you.<br/><br/>Confirm receipt.<br/><br/>A. GROMYKO<br/><br/>19/XI/51</p>  </body>
