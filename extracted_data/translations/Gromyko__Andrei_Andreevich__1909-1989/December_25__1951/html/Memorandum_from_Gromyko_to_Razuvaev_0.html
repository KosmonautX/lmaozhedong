In the opinion of Vyshinsky, MID [Ministry of Foreign Affairs] DPRK should send such a communiqu</span><span class="cs5EFED22F">&eacute;</span><span class="cs5EFED22F"> to the chairman of the General Assembly of the UN with a request to publish it as a document of the UN and to send it to all the delegations in the Assembly session.<br><br>MID USSR considers the above indicated reports of the French and American newspapers as blackmail, done for the purpose of putting pressure on the Korean-Chinese side.<br><br>As regards the communiqu&eacute; proposed by Vyshinsky, in the opinion of MID, it is scarcely necessary to give advice to the Koreans and Chinese on this account, since they systematically publish reports which disclose the line taken by the Americans in the negotiations about an armistice in Korea. From the other side, the distribution of a Korean-Chinese communiqu&eacute; as a document of the UN will not give any practical results, and a request from the Koreans and Chinese about this can be evaluated as a sign of their weakness.<br><br>In view of this, MID considers that to give any kind of advice to the Korean and Chinese governments regarding the </span><span class="cs5EFED22F">communiqu&eacute; </span><span class="cs5EFED22F">is inadvisable.<br><br>A draft resolution is attached.<br><br>I ask you to review.<br><br>A.
