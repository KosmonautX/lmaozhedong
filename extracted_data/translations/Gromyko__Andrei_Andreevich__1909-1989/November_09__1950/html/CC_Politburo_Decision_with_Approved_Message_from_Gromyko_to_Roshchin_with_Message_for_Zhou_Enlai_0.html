    <p>ALL-UNION COMMUNIST PARTY (bolsheviks), CENTRAL COMMITTEE<br/><br/>        No. P78/448                To Bulganin, Molotov, Gromyko.<br/>9 November 1950<br/>Excerpt from protocol No. 78 of the meeting of the Politburo CC VKP(b) [Central Committee, All-Union Communist Party (bolshevik)]<br/><br/>        Decision of 9 November 1950<br/>448.- Question of MID USSR.<br/><br/>        To confirm the attached draft of a telegram to Comrade Roshchin on the question of the participation of China in the Security Council.<br/>        SECRETARY CC<br/>                        To p.448(op) pr.PB <br/><br/>No.78<br/>BEIJING<br/>        SOVIET AMBASSADOR<br/>        For transmission to Zhou Enlai.<br/><br/>        I have received your telegram with the request for a consultation on the question of the participation of China in the [UN] Security Council.<br/><br/>        In our opinion two variants are possible.<br/><br/>        The first variant [is] to refuse to accept the invitation in the manner in which it was formulated in the Security Council.  Motives: the invitation deprives the Chinese people's republic of the right to discuss in the Security Council the most urgent questions of China, in particular the question of the military intervention in Korea and the question of the seizure of Taiwan by the United States of America, its right being limited only to the review of the report of MacArthur.<br/><br/>        The second variant [is] to accept the invitation and to commission the Chinese delegation to make a statement in the Security Council on all the abovementioned questions, turning the discussion of the question into an indictment of the USA.  If they do not allow the Chinese delegation fully to lay out its position, the Chinese delegation will walk out of the meeting and refuse to discuss even one report of MacArthur.<br/><br/>        It seems to us that the first variant is more advisable.<br/><br/>        You should not connect yourself to the conduct of the Soviet delegate in the Security Council, where he voted for the resolution of the English delegate [Gladwyn] Jebb, especially since, speaking between us, Soviet delegate [Jacob] Malik did not have an instruction to vote for the English resolution, but had a direct directive to put in a veto if the Soviet resolution was rejected.  Malik apparently was carried away by the fact that he had nevertheless forced the Americans to vote in favor of inviting China, but he did not take into account that the form of the invitation adopted by the Security Council would place China in a disadvantageous position.<br/><br/>        Telegraph the fulfillment.<br/>                        A.
