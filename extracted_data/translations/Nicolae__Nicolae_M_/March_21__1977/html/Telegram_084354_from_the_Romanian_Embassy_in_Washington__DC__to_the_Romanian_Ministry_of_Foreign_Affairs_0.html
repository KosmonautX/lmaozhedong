Concurrently, American representatives reiterated the position that the US will not accept discussing solutions to the Korean issue in the absence of envoys from Seoul. According to the US diplomat, the DPRK sent a message to the new administration via the Pakistani government, proposing to initiate a dialogue with the US in order to sign a definitive peace treaty and establish stable bilateral relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">The US responded that it cannot accept a dialogue with the DPRK, which excludes South Korea, and proposed a four-party meeting to discuss a new settlement initiating a constructive bilateral dialogue between the two Koreas. </span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">According to Hurwitz, although it is difficult to estimate if and to what extent the DPRK will abandon the rigid position upheld hitherto, a less aggressive tone has been noticeable in its recent statements regarding the United States. </span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">In regards to discussing the Korean issue at the UN, the US would prefer a situation similar to the one from the last General Assembly. Thus far, American representatives have no knowledge of the issue&rsquo;s inclusion on the agenda for the next Assembly. However, if this were to happen, it would only lead to sterile discussions and a potential intensification of the tensions in the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Signed: Nicolae M.
