According to several Department of State representatives, the attitude of North Korean officials is due to Jimmy Carter&rsquo;s position on the matter during his electoral campaign, &ndash; i.e. reducing US troops stationed in South Korea &ndash; as well as to the potential support from the USSR, the PRC and several Non-Aligned countries. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Thus, the DPRK addressed an open letter to President-elect Jimmy Carter and, following his inauguration, sent messages through various heads of state from Africa and Asia, including the President of Gabon and former Pakistani Prime Minister Z. A. Bhutto. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">During his recent visit to the US, Edvard Kardelj also transmitted a message to the American government on behalf of North Korea, through which the DPRK expressed its interest to initiate a dialogue with the US administration regarding the Korean issue. R. Petkovic, Minister at the Yugoslav Embassy, told Comrade Gh. Ionita (Advisor) that North Korean leaders asked President Tito, during his visit to the DPRK this summer, to ensure President Carter receives the message as soon as possible. According to the Yugoslav diplomat, President Jimmy Carter read the message intently, telling Edvard Kardelj that his administration is interested in initiating talks with the North Koreans, however South Korean envoys must also participate with equal rights. Jimmy Carter emphasized to Kardelj what he also responded to the other North Korean messages, namely that:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">a) the Carter administration considers that discussing the Korean issue at the UN is not likely to be conducive to the proper conditions for finding an adequate solution to the situation in the region;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">b) the Carter administration is willing to do everything to decrease tensions on the Korean Peninsula and minimize the possibility of a military conflict in the region;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">c) the US does not oppose a direct dialogue with North Korean envoys, however South Korean representatives must also participate since the US cannot accept excluding South Korea due to its binding obligations under bilateral treaties, as well as to the potential negative reactions South Korea&rsquo;s exclusion would trigger in Asia, particularly in Japan. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Compiled by Advisor Gh.
