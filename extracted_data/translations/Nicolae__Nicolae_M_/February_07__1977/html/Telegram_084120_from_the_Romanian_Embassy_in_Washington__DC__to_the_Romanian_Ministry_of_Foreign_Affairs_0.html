According to the bilateral security treaty, the US will maintain its commitment to strengthen the security of this country and gradually withdraw ground troops in consultation with both South Korean and Japanese authorities. </span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">This position has been recently restated by Vice President Walter Mondale in discussions with the Japanese Prime Minister. </span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">The situation in the Korean Peninsula remains tense and explosive, and the US does not want to alter the military and strategic balance in the region through its position. </span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">The decision to partly withdraw American troops from South Korea is mostly the result of internal pressure within the US, especially after Vietnam, to maintain limited military presence so as to avoid a potential implication in a new military conflict. </span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">The DPRK&rsquo;s recent four-point statement regarding contacts between various political and military organizations in North and South Korea is not concurrent with the joint North-South four-point statement and, thus, not viable. Furthermore, reopening discussions on the Korean question at the United Nations in the current context is not likely to decrease tensions within the Peninsula. </span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">The US believes that a first step could be made through a joint Sino-Soviet-American effort and is willing to have contacts with the DPRK as long as the USSR and the PRC initiate contact with South Korea. </span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Signed: Nicolae M.
