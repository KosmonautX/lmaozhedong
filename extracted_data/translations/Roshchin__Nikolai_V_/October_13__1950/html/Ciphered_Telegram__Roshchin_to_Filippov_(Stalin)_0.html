At present, all these questions have been clarified.<br><br>Mao Zedong pointed out that now it is advantageous for them to dispatch the Chinese troops into Korea. The Chinese have the absolute obligation to send troops to Korea.<br><br>At this point, they are sending the first echelon composed of nine divisions. Although it is poorly armed, it will be able to fight against the troops of Syngman Rhee. In the meantime, the Chinese comrades will have to prepare the second echelon.<br><br>The main thing that we need, says Mao Zedong, is air power which shall provide us with air cover. We hope to see its arrival as soon as possible, but not later than in two months.<br><br>Furthermore, Comrade Mao Zedong noted that at present the government of the People&#39;s Republic of China cannot pay in cash for the armaments delivered. They hope to receive arms on credit.<br><br>Thus, the 1951 budget will not be affected, and it will be easier for them to explain it to the democrats.<br><br>In conclusion, Mao Zedong stated that the leading comrades in the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party believe that the Chinese must come to the assistance of the Korean comrades in their difficult struggle. To discuss this matter, Zhou Enlai will have to meet comrade Filippov again.<br><br>Zhou Enlai is being sent new instructions.<br><br>R O S H C H I N<br><br>No. 2408<br>13.10 [13 October]</span></p></span>
