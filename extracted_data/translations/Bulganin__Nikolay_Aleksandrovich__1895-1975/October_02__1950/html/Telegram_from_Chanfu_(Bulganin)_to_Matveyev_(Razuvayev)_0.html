There is no continuous frontline. These troops are fighting on their own territory, so the population feels compassion toward them and will help them out. They must leave heavy weapons behind and try to get to the north by all means, by using the cover of night and the areas unoccupied by the enemy yet. You have the possibility of rescuing thereby the most valuable asset, that is, the cadres.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE"><br>Take all the necessary measures to implement this directive.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE"><br>Telegraph the fulfillment. <br><br>C H A N F U [BULGANIN]<br><br>2 October 1950</span></p></span>
