Pimenov, Minister-Counselor within the USSR Embassy, pointed out that the Soviet Embassy believed that North Korea committed a serious error by undertaking this action. </span></p><p class="cs71E2DA5E"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The Democratic People&#39;s Republic of Korea thus offered the authorities in Seoul an important political chapter [content] which the [South Koreans] can use to diminish forthcoming spring student demonstrations and even directing them on an anti-North path. </span></p><p class="cs71E2DA5E"><span class="cs5EFED22F">B.K. Pimenov said that the Democratic People&#39;s Republic of Korea would find it difficult from thereon to re-establish its authority amongst its South Korean sympathizers. In these conditions, not even the forthcoming reunion of the North-South committee, scheduled for February 27th, can contribute to reaching an understanding, [being very likely that] the discussions be transformed into a fiery argument.</span></p><p class="cs71E2DA5E"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Signed: Dumitru Popa</span></p></span>
