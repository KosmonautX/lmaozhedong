It is assumed that such a gesture on behalf of US authorities represents a change in the American position towards the DPRK. </span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Our Embassy believes there is no conclusive evidence of this alleged change. </span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Signed: D. Popa</span></p></span>
