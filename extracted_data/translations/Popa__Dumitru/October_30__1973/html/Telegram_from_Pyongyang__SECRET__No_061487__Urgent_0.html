Dudoladov, Soviet first secretary, we noted that the USSR is unpleased with the current state of its relations with the DPRK, given that currently Korean-Soviet relations are in a state of stalemate, that exchanges of delegations have been reduced to an all-time low and that the lack of initiative from the North Korean side has been complemented with a passive attitude regarding Soviet initiatives.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">I.N. Dudoladov mentioned that his country&rsquo;s relations with the DPRK had passed through such critical moments before, but contrary to past experiences, when Soviet diplomats were worried and alarmed about the respective circumstances, they were adopting a much more indifferent attitude, which, according to the Soviet diplomat, had overarching and rapid effects on the [Korean] hosts.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Dudoladov said that compared to the reserved attitude the DPRK is adopting towards the USSR, the USSR come forward with proposals to support the DPRK on the international arena, taking such actions that the DPRK reconsiders its position towards the USSR on its own.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The Soviet diplomat mentioned that this state of bilateral relations between the USSR and the DPRK would last for at least another year, at which point they will gain the intensity which characterized them in the past years. He added that relations between the DPRK and the PRC follow the same tenuous path [as relations between the DPRK and the USSR] except that good relations between the DPRK and the PRC correspond to cold relations between the DPRK and the USSR, and vice-versa.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">I.N. Dudoladov pointed out that although it was less than one week until the anniversary of the USSR October Socialist Revolution, the Koreans have not informed the USSR embassy about the ceremonies meant to celebrate that day in the DPRK, which means that this year&rsquo;s attention to November 7th would be insignificant. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Signed: Dumitru Popa</span></p></span>
