By infringing on the commitments mutually agreed upon through the Joint Communiqu&eacute; of July 1972, the situation is growing tense and the smooth development of the inter-Korean dialogue is hindered. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Therefore, on 23 April, at the request of the Americans in the Armistice Commission a session took place at Panmunjeom, where the DPRK was charged with sending a group of spies in South Korea on the night of 17 April (3 people, 2 of whom were shot in the Southern part of the demilitarized zone) and was accused of not accepting to investigate this case jointly.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Although the North Koreans publicly denounced this setting-up, the arguments they invoked were not convincing and categorical enough, which provided the authorities in Seoul and the Americans with plenty of ammunition to condemn the DPRK for &ldquo;its duplicitous policies, aiming at winning the support of public opinion by charging the South and the Americans [for various things], while in reality being the one committing the provocations and perpetuating a state of tension on the Korean Peninsula.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">In these circumstances, we believe that the second meeting of the South-North Coordinating Committee Secretariat, planned for 24 April in Panmunjeom, will unfold in a tense atmosphere.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Irrespective of its authors, the aforementioned incident, as all the others from previous months, provide supportive arguments for the continued stationing of US troops in South Korea, and reasons for easily combating against the letters adopted at the recent session of the Supreme People&rsquo;s Assembly addressed to the US Senate and House of Representatives.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Signed: Dumitru Popa</span></p></span>
