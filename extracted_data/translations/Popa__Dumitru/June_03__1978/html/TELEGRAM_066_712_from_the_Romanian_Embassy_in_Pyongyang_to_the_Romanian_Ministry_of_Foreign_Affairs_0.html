Although endowed with important natural resources, Mozambique inherited a very low general level of development, as a result of colonial domination. For these reasons, the People&rsquo;s Republic of Mozambique currently needs many cadres, especially technicians and engineers.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">Throughout the visit, President S. Machel sought to learn more about the Korean experience in training the cadres and asked for the support of the Korean government on this issue.
