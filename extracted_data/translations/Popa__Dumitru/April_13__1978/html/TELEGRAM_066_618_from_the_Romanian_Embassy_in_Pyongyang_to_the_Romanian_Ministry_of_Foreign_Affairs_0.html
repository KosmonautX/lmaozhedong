Belyi, First Secretary of the Soviet Embassy in Pyongyang, told V. Nanu that Soviet-Korean relations, following the visit to Moscow of the former DPRK Prime Minister, Pak Seong-cheol (in January 1977) and the visit to Pyongyang of D. Kunaev, member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the CPSU (January 1978) remain in a good state, experiencing a relative progress compared with previous years. Therefore in 1977, almost 30 Soviet delegations at various levels visited the DPRK, and approximately 40 Korean delegations visited the USSR. Since last year, 6 Soviet delegations (filmmakers, labor union leaders, economic delegations, academics, youth delegations, civil aviation delegations) visited the DPRK and 4 Korean delegations (O Jin-u, the North Korean minister of the People&rsquo;s Armed Forces, the association of engineers and technicians, an economic delegation and a sports delegation) visited the USSR.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">Currently, Korean-Soviet negotiations on the signing of the commercial protocol for 1978 have been going on in Moscow for several months. The [Soviet diplomat] said that the negotiations are proceeding with difficulty, because, among other things, the Soviets insist that the balance of trade is balanced.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">A. Belyi said that starting on April 9</span><sup><span class="cs6D6FB01F">th</span></sup><span class="cs566403DE">, 1978, the DPRK Ministry of External Economic Affairs delegation, led by Liu Kan-won [sic], the Head of the Policy Planning Department, will come to Moscow to discuss with the Soviet authorities the completion rate of the [A.L.D] (for 1976-1980), the prospects until 1980, including the use of the loan given by the USSR in February 1976.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">Moreover, at the end of May or June, a delegation of the DPRK State Planning Committee is due to visit Moscow to discuss the matter regarding commercial exchanges and economic and technical-scientific cooperation between the two countries between 1981 and 1984, respectively the last 4 years of DPRK&rsquo;s 7-year development plan.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">[The Soviet diplomat] said that currently, one could talk about a general improvement in Soviet-Korean relations.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">When making this assessment, A. Belyi added, &lsquo;we take into account the future visit to Moscow of President Kim Il Sung.&rsquo; The Soviet diplomat said that the Korean and Soviet ministries of foreign affairs have been recently given the task to agree on a period when President Kim Il Sung&rsquo;s visit will take place. Until now, there is no clear date; there are rumors among the members of the diplomatic corps that the aforementioned visit could take place between August and September 1978.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">Signed</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">Dumitru Popa</span></p></span>
