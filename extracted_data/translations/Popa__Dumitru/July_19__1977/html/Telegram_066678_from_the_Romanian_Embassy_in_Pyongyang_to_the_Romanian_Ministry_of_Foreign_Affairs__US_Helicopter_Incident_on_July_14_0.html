Evidently, this is partly due to the fact that the US assumed responsibility for the incident. </span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">We consider this to be a step further towards establishing favorable conditions for initiating a dialogue to solve the Korean question. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Signed: Dumitru Popa</span></p></span>
