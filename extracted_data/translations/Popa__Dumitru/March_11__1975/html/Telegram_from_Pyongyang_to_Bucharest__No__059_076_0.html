There is an increase in the number of declarations pointing that a future dismantling of the U.N. troops&rsquo; headquarters in South Korea will not influence the presence of US troops in the Korean Peninsula.</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="cs5EFED22F">In various ways, guarantees are being required from the Americans that &ldquo;in the present situation a withdrawal of foreign troops from South Korea is not in question and impossible&rdquo;. </span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="cs5EFED22F">South Koreans are intensely &ldquo;assisting&rdquo; South Vietnamese refugees, by providing them with food, medicine and transportation means for their evacuation from dangerous areas.</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="cs5EFED22F">At the same time, with the intensification of anti-communist propaganda and the increase to a maximum of the &ldquo;Northern danger,&rdquo; measures are being taken in South Korea for preventing any type of disorder. Thus, new restrictions, backed by last year&rsquo;s decrees for exceptional situations, have been again set in place over the last days. An increase in the number of arrests, together with an intensified censorship of the opposition&rsquo;s political activity is being registered.</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="cs5EFED22F">We note an increased activity of the union of progressive forces under the leadership of neo-democratic and unity parties, a coalition that we deem capable of successfully conducting activities against the current President Park Chung Hee. </span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Nevertheless we note that presently in South Korea not even the opposition fosters anti-American feelings, which helps the authorities in Seoul and the US, which until now does not allow for the possibility to renounce the positions they occupied in the country.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Signed: Dumitru Popa</span></p></span>
