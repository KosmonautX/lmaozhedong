Lazar about various difficulties as a result of the lack of a sufficient consumer goods stock and of large foreign debts the DPRK cannot currently repay. Poland, emphasized Glinski, would like to support its Korean counterpart in overcoming these difficulties and suggested that, apart from developing bilateral economic relations, the DPRK should consider adhering to the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The Polish Advisor claimed that the DPRK received this year similar proposals from various socialist countries, including twice from Poland, yet the suggestions were not met with an encouraging response. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">We consider that re-inviting the DPRK to become a member of the CMEA is a coordinated action part of the visible efforts of the USSR and other European socialist countries to befriend the DPRK, under the belief that economic difficulties will compel the DPRK to join the CMEA.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Signed: Dumitru Popa</span></p></span>
