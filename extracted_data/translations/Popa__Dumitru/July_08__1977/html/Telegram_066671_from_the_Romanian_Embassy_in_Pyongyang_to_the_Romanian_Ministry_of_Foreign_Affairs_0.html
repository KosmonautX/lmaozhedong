Lazar, the People&rsquo;s Republic of Poland charg&eacute; d&#39;affaires ad interim in Pyongyang, P. Glinski, recounted that both the Polish and the Korean parties have been very pleased with the Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs Wladyslaw Wojtasik&rsquo;s</span><span class="csD93B9219"> </span><span class="cs5EFED22F">visit to the DPRK. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The DPRK has advertised this visit more than usual since it was at the beginning of the &lsquo;month of solidarity with the Korean people&rsquo; and because the Polish Minister had made ample declarations in support of a peaceful reunification and Korean independence, immediate and complete withdrawal of US troops from South Korea, etc. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The Polish diplomat noted that, during the visit, Comrade Kim Il Sung expressed his desire to meet with Comrade Edward Gierek, verbally renewing his invitation to visit DPRK. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">In addition to the general and well-known issues, President Kim Il Sung emphasized that the DPRK is currently in a difficult state due to the economic instability of 1976, when drought caused a decrease in electric energy production and, implicitly, an industrial slowdown. It was further mentioned that even today certain factories work only at 45-50% of their potential. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Comrade Kim Il Sung assured the Polish officials that DPRK will overcome these difficulties and will do everything to acquit its financial obligations to foreign partners, particularly to the socialist countries.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Wladyslaw Wojtasik agreed with his counterpart, Heo Dam [Ho Dam], to meet annually in the two capitals by rotation. Following that, in 1978 the DPRK&rsquo;s Minister of Foreign Affairs will visit the PRP. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Polish officials inquired whether the DPRK determined its stance regarding the potential inclusion of the Korean issue on the agenda of the next UN General Assembly. It can be inferred from the Korean Minister&rsquo;s incomplete response that the DRPK will press for the enactment of the 1975 resolution on the matter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Signed: D.
