We believe this reprise to be a result not so much of wanting to establish contact with the government in Seoul &ndash; since the conditions put forward by the DPRK are unacceptable to the ROK &ndash; but of countering South Korea&rsquo;s campaign against the DPRK, according to which the latter vehemently opposes any dialogue with the ROK and Korean reunification, implicitly. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Signed: D.
