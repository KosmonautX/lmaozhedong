In this respect, the Romanian party and state leadership allotted, with the help of former Vice-Premier Jeong Jun-taek [Jong Jun Thaek], a significant [portion] of aid, for which the Korean Workers&rsquo; Party is deeply grateful.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">With respect to bilateral relations, Pak Seong-cheol offered a very positive appraisal on their evolution in the interval following the visit to the DPRK of Comrade Nicolae Ceausescu and he underlined that Comrade Kim Il Sung repeatedly assigned to the Korean party and state cadres, the task to militate incessantly for the consolidation and development of collaboration with Romania.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Talking about the recent visit to Romania of the delegation led by Kim Dong-gyu [Kim Tong Gyu], the Vice-Premier said that &ldquo;Comrade Kim Il Sung was very happy with the honest, [and friendly] atmosphere in which the discussion with Comrade Nicolae Ceausescu [took place].&rdquo; He said that the head of the Korean delegation presented a report before the Political Committee on matters related to his trip in Europe and that the results of his visit to Romania enjoyed the high appreciation of the party leadership.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">A summary of the main comments made at various levels of the North Korean party and government with respect to the party leadership&rsquo;s visit to Romania and especially with respect to the meeting between Comrade Nicolae Ceausescu and Kim Dong-gyu makes us think that Comrade Kim Il Sung understood the meaning of the message sent by the Secretary General of the Romanian Communist Party, taking note of the value of the ideas suggested on this occasion.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Signed: Dumitru Popa</span></p></span>
