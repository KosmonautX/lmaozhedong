The North Korean press systematically refutes, sometimes in an insufficiently persuasive manner, these reports. </span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Externally, there is a sustained concern from the Democratic People&#39;s Republic of Korea to establish diplomatic relations and to join organizations where South Korea is already present. </span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">To our mind, this approach is not meant to draw the two countries closer, but on the contrary, it is supposed to undermine and gradually weaken the positions of the authorities in Seoul. </span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Starting from this rationale, the Democratic People&#39;s Republic of Korea is currently carefully studying the attitude it shall take towards the forthcoming session of the United Nations, especially since, recently, Seoul decided to register this matter on the agenda, going against its old position in favor of postponing a discussion of the Korean matter.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Depending on the position it will take, the Democratic People&#39;s Republic of Korea will or will not use the right it has owing to its membership in the World Health Organization to appoint an observer to the UN.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Against this background, there will be another reunion of co-presidents of the South-North Coordinating Committee on 9 June. </span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Signed: Dumitru Popa</span></p></span>
