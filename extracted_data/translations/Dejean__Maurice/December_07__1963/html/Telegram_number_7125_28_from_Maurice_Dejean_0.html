Khrushchev for an end to the disputes between parties and calls on Beijing to play by the rules by giving up on &lsquo;factionism&rsquo;, the attitude of the Chinese delegation at the peace council meeting in Warsaw shows to what extent the CCP is not in line with the behavior suggested by the Soviets. </span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">	By presenting information about the Warsaw meeting, to which it has given great publicity, the Soviet press mostly emphasized the fact that the work of the peace council highlighted the renewed vigor of the people to push forward the causes of disarmament and d&eacute;tente, and to foil the intrigues of the warmongers. It underlined the call made in Warsaw in favor of a complete ban of nuclear tests, a non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, the creation of nuclear-free zones and cuts in military budgets. It also made note of the adoption of resolutions on problems such as South Africa, Korea, South and North Vietnam, where it sees evidence of the close connection between the struggle for peace and the efforts of national liberation movements. </span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">	The reports of the Soviet press did their utmost to minimize the differences that emerged once again between the Chinese or pro-Chinese delegations and the majority of the peace movement. It is heartwarming to note, wrote member of the Soviet delegation in Warsaw M. Kotov, that the delegates spent more of their time on factors that united them than those that divided them. The attempts made to divide the champions of peace were condemned.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">	The Soviet press confined itself to pointing out that various resolutions were adopted with strong majorities. It noted that the Chinese, Albanian, North Korean, North Vietnamese delegations, as well as some Japanese delegates, had voted against the resolution for the convening of a world peace conference. It also mentioned that the draft Chinese motion condemning the Moscow Treaty had only received 38 votes, with 21 of those from the Chinese. </span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">	Finally, the press completely ignored the incident caused by the Chinese refusal to take part in the homage to President Kennedy.</span></p><p class="cs7C1F8B9D"><span class="cs566403DE">Signed Maurice Dejean</span></p></span>
