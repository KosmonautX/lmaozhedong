On October 30th, he visited me, and informed me about the following:</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">A [North Korean] delegation headed by Pak Seong-cheol [Pak Song Chol] had traveled to Moscow. Deputy Foreign Minister Ri Man-seok [Ri Man Sok] and Kim Yun-seon [Kim Yun Son], the deputy head of the International Liaisons Office of the [Korean Workers&rsquo; Party] CC, were also members of the delegation. There were also experts traveling with the delegation. They spent two days in Moscow. On the request of the Koreans, Comrade Brezhnev had talks with the delegation. The essence of what was said by Pak Seong-cheol is the following:</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">I) According to the Korean leadership&rsquo;s evaluation, the influence of the rightist parties is considerably decreasing in South Korea, [whereas] the strength of the opposition parties has substantially increased. This is clearly shown by the electoral results, the growth of the movement of progressive forces, and the actions of the student movement. Park Chung Hee is becoming more and more isolated.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">II) The DPRK must take advantage of this situation so as to compel the South Korean [political] forces to accept the peaceful unification of the motherland. The DPRK has worked out a number of measures with regard to that. </span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) In the international sphere, they take advantage of every opportunity and occasion to recruit as many supporters for their policy of peaceful national unification as possible. As far as possible, they intend to make use of the UN and other international organizations, too.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through political and diplomatic means, they want to bring great international pressure to bear on the USA in order to achieve the withdrawal of its troops and the abrogation of the U.S.-South Korean military treaty. </span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) They want to make Japan understand that the U.S. presence in South Korea and Japan as well as the South Korean-[Japanese] treaty hinders the unification of the motherland. They want to achieve the abrogation of the treaty.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) They turned to the Soviet Union with the direct request that [the USSR] should try to achieve the aforesaid results [in the course of its negotiations] with the USA and Japan. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="csA1E23476">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">&ndash; 124 &ndash; S[ebesty&eacute;n] &ndash;</span></p></span>
