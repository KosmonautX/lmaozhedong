OCTOBER 1976, 11.08am</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Case: Smuggling at North Korean Embassy in Oslo. </span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">North Korea&rsquo;s Ambassador [Hyeon Jun-geuk (Hyun Jun Guk)] requested a meeting today and informed [me] of the following:</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">The North Korean Embassy in Beijing was just informed of the events in Oslo. He wished to inform the embassy of his views, and asked for consultations and cooperation on the issue. He opened by stating that because of my function as Ambassador to North Korea, it was natural to consult me. He was aware of the decision by the Norwegian Government to order the diplomats to leave the country as a result of their illegal activities. This was entirely new information to the Ambassador, and he expressed doubts about the validity of the claims. He then said that the wish to improve the relationship between our two countries was the reason why North Korea had established diplomatic relations with Norway in the first place. In accordance with the policies of North Korea, they had worked hard to ensure good relations with Norway. Their embassy in Oslo had displayed utmost respect for Norwegian law, and carried out their work within Norwegian legal boundaries. He could hardly believe that members of North Korea&rsquo;s Embassy had been engaged in illegal activities. Despite the improbable nature of the issue, Norwegian authorities had taken unilateral action and ordered the North Korean embassy personnel to leave the country without consulting North Korean authorities. This was most regrettable to the North Koreans.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">He went on to say that the North Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs would take measures to clarify whether or not the diplomats had been involved in illegal activities. If this turned out to be the case, it would constitute a violation of government policy, and the involved staff would be punished.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">He again expressed his regrets that the Norwegian government had taken the unexpected step to expel the embassy personnel without consultation or negotiation with the North Korean government without considering how this may be detrimental to relations between the two countries. He hoped our two countries could resolve the issue so as to prevent a deterioration of our good relationship as a result of this issue. The Ambassador went on to suggest that if the claims of illegal activities turns out to be true, it may very well be that individuals acting against the will of the North Korean government are to blame. Finally, he expressed hopes that a negotiated settlement of the issue may be reached.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">I referred to the contents of 84 dated 18.10.76 and made clear that because Norwegian police had decided to take action it was highly unlikely that it did not have incriminating evidence. Furthermore, I told him that I could not engage in neither consultations or negotiations relating to the issue without orders from Oslo, but I promised to inform the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs of his request.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Finally, I informed him that he would be notified promptly if such an order was issued from Oslo.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">[Ambassador Torleiv] Anda</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">-----</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">I am scheduled to travel to Canton [Guangzhou] tomorrow, 22. October, at 9pm local time. I may stay in Beijing if necessary. Please advise on this per telex. </span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">[Torleiv] Anda</span></p></span>
