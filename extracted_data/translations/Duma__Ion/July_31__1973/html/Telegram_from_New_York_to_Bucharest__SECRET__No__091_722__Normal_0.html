In this vein, the Chinese diplomat mentioned that &lsquo;some Western countries&rsquo; consider that withdrawal from South Korea would create a &lsquo;vacuum,&rsquo; which, sooner or later, shall be filled by the U.S.S.R. with the approval of the DPRK. The Chinese diplomat expressed his &lsquo;puzzlement&rsquo; regarding the refusal of the DPRK to accept a U.S. military presence in South Korea after the two states had been welcomed into the U.N. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csDFF27C7C"><br></span><span class="cs5EFED22F">Referring to the possibility of debating &lsquo;the Korean issue&rsquo; at the next U.N. General Assembly meeting, the Chinese diplomat expressed his opinion that the only possible results would be the dissolving of the U.N. commission for Korea and of the U.N. commandment for foreign troops stationed in South Korea. He suggested that the People&rsquo;s Republic of China would not oppose the stationing of U.S. troops in South Korea, granted they are based on bilateral agreements.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Signed: Charg&eacute; d&rsquo;affaires Ion Duma</span></p></span>
