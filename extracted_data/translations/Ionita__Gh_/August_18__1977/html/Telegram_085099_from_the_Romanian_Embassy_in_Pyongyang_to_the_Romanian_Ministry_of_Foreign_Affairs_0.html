Helman, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for International Organization Affairs, mentioned the following: </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">1. Recently, North Korea envoys have begun approaching the US again with the proposal of organizing bilateral meetings in view of discussing the situation in the Korean Peninsula. The US responded in concordance with its established position that it cannot accept such a proposal as long as the participation of South Korean officials is excluded. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">2. Presently, the US has no knowledge of the DPRK&rsquo;s intentions to reiterate its well-known resolutions at the next UN General Assembly. However, the US does not exclude the possibility that the DPRK will act around certain states in order to cause conflict at the 32</span><sup><span class="cs36E2AA4C">nd</span></sup><span class="cs5EFED22F"> Assembly based on these resolutions. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">If this were to happen, the US will proceed in the same manner it has thus far and ensure that a sufficient number of votes will overturn such resolutions. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">3. The US administration is careful not to trigger negative reactions in Pyongyang and, therefore, proceeds in a prudent manner, leaving the DPRK to believe that the US is in favor of a joint dialogue with the two Koreas. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">As such, Helman emphasized that President Carter places great importance on avoiding tensions in the Korean Peninsula. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Signed: Gh.
