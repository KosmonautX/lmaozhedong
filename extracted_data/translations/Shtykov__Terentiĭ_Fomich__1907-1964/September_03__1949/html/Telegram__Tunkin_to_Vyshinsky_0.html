Kim Il Sung is convinced that they are in a position to seize South Korea in the course of two weeks, maximum 2 months.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">I asked [Mun] to transmit to Kim Il Sung that this question is very large and serious, it is necessary to think it through carefully and that I therefore urgently recommend to Kim Il Sung not to be in a hurry and not to take [any measures] while there is no decision on this question.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Kim Il Sung will probably raise this question again soon.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">It has been established that the [North] Koreans truly did seize an order to the commander of troops on the Ongjin peninsula to begin artillery fire on the cement plant in Kaisiu on September 2 at 8:00 and to destroy it. From the order it is clear that the southerners consider this plant to be military. The period indicated in the order has past but so far there has been no shelling. The northerners have taken the necessary measures in case of firing on the plant.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Regarding the intentions of the southerners to seize part of the Ongjin Peninsula to the north of the 38th parallel, we have only indications [of this] from deserters from the south.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">There have not been any serious incidents at the 38th parallel since August 15. Small exchanges of fire have taken place, [there have been] instances of artillery firing on the territory of North Korea on the Ongjin Peninsula, trespassing of the parallel. The southerners are carrying out defensive work at the 38th parallel at a faster tempo. I ask your order. </span></p><p class="cs7C1F8B9D"><span class="cs566403DE">3.9.49 &nbsp;&nbsp;[Charge d&#39;Affaires] Tunkin.</span></p></span>
