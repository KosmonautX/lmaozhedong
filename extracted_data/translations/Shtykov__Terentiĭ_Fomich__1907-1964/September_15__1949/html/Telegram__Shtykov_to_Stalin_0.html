		<span><p class="cs2A4A7CB2"><span class="cs566403DE">Comrade Stalin I.V:</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">As an addendum to my note of 27 August 1949 I submit a brief description of the political and economic situation in the south and north of Korea and information about the relative strength of the contending democratic and reactionary forces and their influence among the people.</span></p><p class="cs2A4A7CB2"><span class="csA0E9A871">The political situation in the south of Korea</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">The political situation in the south of the country in all the four years since the liberation of Korea from the Japanese is marked by a sharp political struggle between left- and right-wing parties and organizations. The struggle between these two camps in connection with the Moscow decision of the three ministers on Korean issues (1945) has taken on an especially sharp nature.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">The sharp political struggle between the left and right in connection with the Moscow decision has to a considerable degree created an opportunity for the Americans to torpedo the Moscow decision on Korea.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">The Americans and the South Korean reactionaries, convinced that they will not succeed in creating an anti-democratic government in Korea and seeing that the left enjoys great authority among the people, have waged an active campaign against the Workers Party, the vanguard of all the left-wing parties and organizations.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">At the order of the Americans in 1947 the Korean police destroyed all the print shops and closed the left-wing newspapers. An order was issued for the arrest of senior officials of left-wing parties and organizations. The left-wing parties and organizations were forced to go underground as a result of the terror and persecution. Especially great terror was launched against the leftists in 1948 in connection with the arrival in Korea of a UN commission and preparations for separate elections in the south of the country. Many left- wing leaders were arrested. Many were shot without trial or investigation and landowners would not lease land to peasants in the Workers Party and manual laborers and white- collar workers were fired from industry.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">As a consequence of such a situation the Workers Party of the South of Korea declined from 900,000 to 240,000 by the end of 1948. A further decline of the Party&#39;s numbers is occurring in 1949 because of the departure politically unstable [members] and the repressions which are being employed against members of the Workers Party. A similar situation is also happening in other leftist organizations. However, in spite of the terror and repression carried out by the authorities through the police, the left-wing organizations are managing to hold some of their own events.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">The Workers&rsquo; Party and the leftist organizations associated with it are working among the population of villages and cities: they explain American policy toward Korea to the people and the traitorous behavior of the Syngman Rhee government toward their own people, they denounce activity of the UN commission with respect to Korea, they explain to the people the measures being carried out by the democratic government and the reforms being carried out in the interests of the people in the north of Korea.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">When withdrawing their troops the Americans set conditions on the Syngman Rhee government that they could give him weapons only on conditions that the government take measures to suppress the left-wing organizations and eliminate the partisan movement in South Korea.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">The government took such measures. Not only police units were enlisted to suppress the partisan movement in March and April 1949 but also selected army units. The minister of war, the minister of internal affairs, and the prime minister went to the island of Jeju to supervise the suppression of the partisan movement and finally Syngman Rhee, to inspect the operations of the military units and the police.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">The operation to suppress the partisan movement on the island was actually led by American officers.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Both sides suffered heavy losses as a result of the battles that took place.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">According to an official statement of the South Korean government 15,000 rebels were killed during the suppression of this uprising. According to the information of our friends about 30,000 partisans and civilians were killed.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">However, in spite of the measures taken by the Syngman Rhee government, this battle did not have success on the mainland. They managed to suppress the uprising on the island of Jeju but this movement is increasingly spreading on the mainland. According to the information of our friends about 2,000 partisans are active at the present time. The partisans have conducted more than 2,000 operations in 1949 and in areas of the operations the population gives aid with food and clothing, informs the partisans of the places of assembly of troops and police which are assembling to fight the partisans. The puppet government itself admits that the troops and police are suffering heavy losses in suppressing the partisan movement.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">The greatest difficulties in the partisan movement are a shortage of militarily experienced personnel and a great shortage of weapons and ammunition.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">The CC of the Workers Party took steps to eliminate these shortcomings. Command personnel and instructors are being trained for military instruction, and steps have been taken to purchase Japanese and American weapons and ammunition.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">The partisan movement is led by the CC of the Workers Party through its representatives. According to a report from our friends all the conditions and prerequisites for a further growth of the partisan movement exist and they are taking the necessary steps to expand this movement.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">The political situation is extremely strained for the South Korean government. The fight against left-wing parties and organizations and also against the partisans which they are conducting is not popular among the people and is provoking great unrest among the people.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Syngman Rhee has not yet managed to unite even the right-wing camp around the government. A struggle for power and influence by the parties in government continues among the parties and their leaders in the right-wing camp. In his policy Syngman Rhee depends on the Democratic Party (a bourgeois landowners party) and the organizations associated with it. A number of right-wing parties oppose the seizure of power by the Democratic Party. The work being pursued at the request of Syngman Rhee to unite the right-wing parties and create a so-called national camp has still not had success.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">The Workers Party and left-wing organizations associated with it are skillfully using the differences in the rightists&#39; camp and also the anti-national policy being pursued by Syngman Rhee and his accomplices to the benefit of American imperialism and are attracting to their side a number of centrist and right-wing parties and organizations which are dissatisfied with the government&#39;s policy. The leftists have managed to bring over [peretashchit&#39;] a certain part of the prominent leaders of the centrist and right-wing parties to the north of the country. The Workers Party has skillfully organized work to attract a number of deputies of the National Assembly of South Korea to their side. At the instruction of the Workers Party at meetings of the National Assembly deputies make a number of demands directed at undermining the authority of the South Korean government and American policy in Korea.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">The petition of 62 deputies demanding the withdrawal of American troops from Korea, the expression of a vote of no confidence in the government, and a demand for the resignation of all the ministers can be included among such issues. This demand was supported by a majority of the National Assembly. During a discussion of laws they denounce the anti-popular nature of these laws and seek to change them.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Leftist parties and organizations manage to quite successfully denounce the government of Syngman Rhee as an anti-popular government. The practical experience of the work of the Syngman Rhee government during the year it has existed has clearly shown that it is not able to solve a single issue in the interest of the people. The principal and main political and economic issues, the solutions to which are expected by all the people of the south of Korea, have not yet been solved. The land issue is one of these issues. Land reform has not been carried out so far. The land is in the hands of the landowners. The issue of Japanese property has not been solved. The problem of the working day and labor legislation has not been solved. The problem of local government bodies has not yet been solved. There are no elected government bodies in districts and provinces.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">The people think that the National Assembly and government are adopting and enforcing only those laws which are to the advantage of the Americans and the government, the laws on taxes from the population, the approval of unequal treaties, etc.</span></p><p class="cs2A4A7CB2"><span class="csA0E9A871">The economic situation in the south of the country is also serious.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">The majority of industrial enterprises are not operating because of a lack of electrical power and raw material. Many enterprises bought by Korean capitalists have been closed and the equipment sold off. Unemployment is constantly growing.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Agriculture is declining from year to year. Many landowners, fearing land reform, are taking steps to sell land to the peasants. Peasants are refusing to buy because of a lack of money. Wishing to force the peasant to buy the land, the landowner refuses to lease him the land. Thus, much land remains unworked and fallow and the peasants go hungry. A second important factor in agriculture is the lack of fertilizer. American firms are supplying fertilizer, however Korean peasants do not want to buy it because of the poor quality and high price. The decrease of cultivated land and production of agricultural output continues as a consequence of such a situation in agriculture. The government rice purchase plan for 1948 provided for purchasing 7,500,000 sek (one sek equals 150 kg) but actually bought 3,700,000 sek, or 49.4%. The reduction of the production of grain has led to the government not being able to ensure the supply of the population with food. According to a statement by the Minister of Land and Forestry the government planned to provide a population of 7,200,000 with a ration of 450 grams a day. However, the food collected is sufficiently only to supply 2,900,000 people with 300 grams a day. Such a serious economic situation of the working class and peasantry creates a hopelessness among them and causes dissatisfaction with the government and the policy it is pursuing. The political situation of the South Korean government is not secure. The so-called National Assembly (parliament) which has been created is not a representative body. Its elected deputies have not a single worker, peasant, or progressive intellectual. It mainly consists of landowners, merchants, and reactionary intellectuals. The government which has been created and its ministers are not popular among the people and do not have the authority and support of the broad strata of the people. Understanding the weakness and the lack of authority of the South Korean government among the broad masses of the people, the Americans are launching a number of measures directed at supporting this government.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">With the aid of their satellites the Americans have achieved recognition of the South Korean government at a session of the General Assembly as the legal government, after which America officially recognized this government and exchanged ambassadors. The South Korean government has been recognized by 18 countries with American aid. Much propaganda work is being conducted around this fact in the south of Korea. In recent months the discussion of the issue of granting Korea a credit of $150 million has been at the center of attention of America and South Korea. All this is being presented as American aid. With the aid of the Americans Syngman Rhee acted as the initiator of the creation of a Pacific Union to fight Communism to raise his prestige among the people. However, the people of Korea regard this measure of Syngman Rhee with mistrust and even irony.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">A number of statements by American officials were made in connection with the withdrawal of American troops from Korea that the Korean government would be given aid to protect against an attack by the Northern Communists.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">It is evident from those measures which the Americans are taking with respect to Korea that they are interested in Korea not only from an economic point of view, to secure Korea as a market to sell their goods, but also as a strategic bridgehead on the mainland. A number of measures are being taken, primarily of a military nature and the suppression of the forces which are fighting the current regime, in order to strengthen the current puppet government of Syngman Rhee and his regime in the country.</span></p><p class="cs2A4A7CB2"><span class="csA0E9A871">The police measures of the government of Syngman Rhee</span><span class="cs566403DE"> </span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">The Syngman Rhee government is taking the most brutal measures against left-wing parties and organizations. All the left-wing parties and organizations have been forced underground. Print publications have been closed and printing houses destroyed. When the activity of left-wing organizations is discovered the members are arrested and thrown into prison. Those arrested are subjected to unprecedented torture and shot. For example, according to an official report in the cities of [Riosu] and [Supchen] by decision of a so- called military council 1,170 people were shot from 22 October to 9 November 1948 for participation in an uprising and more than 10,0000 were actually shot there. Also according to official reports of the South Korean authorities 1,742 people were killed in March and April 1949 in the province of South Jeolla for participation in the partisan movement. From far from complete information of our friends more than 80,000 people have been killed in the south of Korea in these three years. From January to October 1948 136,000 people were arrested, of which more than 40,000 were tried and thrown into prison.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">However, in spite of the repression and terror being carried out the struggle of the Korean people in the south of Korea for democracy and independence continues.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">The South Korean government has more than 60,000 police armed with Japanese rifles and American automatic weapons to protect so-called public order and fight anti-national elements.</span></p><p class="cs2A4A7CB2"><span class="csA0E9A871">The condition of the South Korean army</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">The South Korean army has seven infantry divisions and five independent infantry regiments and battalions. The total strength of the army is 85,000. There is an army to defend the motherland of five brigades of about 50,000 men (a paramilitary organization).</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Until 1949 the army was manned on a volunteer basis, however the main backbone of the army is members of right-wing youth organizations who are sons of landowners, merchants, and other reactionary elements. Officers, as a rule, are selected from Koreans who served in the Japanese Army and also the Kuomintang and even American armies. The army is not sufficiently trained in the firing and tactical sense. The experience of combat operations at the 38th parallel shows that the units of the South Korean army are poorly trained tactically, as a consequence of which they suffer heavy losses when attacking. With respect to political morale, the units located at the 38th parallel show themselves to be reliable and voluntarily surrender [only] individually during combat operations. However, the experience of the work of our friends to demoralize the South Korean army by sending their people there and conducting appropriate work shows that work to demoralize the army might have some success. For example, as a result of the work of an agent network sent from North Korea two battalion commanders and a certain group of enlisted men and officers were recruited, as a result of which two battalions deserted to the north of Korea in May 1949.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">At the instruction of the Americans in 1948 and 1949 the South Korean authorities did much work to purge the army of unreliable and politically unstable elements.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">The army is isolated from the population as a rule and ordinary soldiers deal little with the population.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Political work with the soldiers is done only in one direction, the fight against Communism, the defeat of the army of North Korea, and the destruction of the existing order in the north.</span></p><p class="cs2A4A7CB2"><span class="csA0E9A871">The political and economic situation in the north of Korea</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">The political situation in the north of Korea is marked by the constant growth of the authority of the bodies of political power and a political upsurge of the popular masses in the struggle to rebuild and develop the economy and national culture.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">The existing democratic political parties and public organizations are united in the Democratic United Front which coordinates and directs their activity; the leading political party is the Workers Party, which numbers 900,000. Great democratic reforms have been carried out during the last four years since the country was liberated from the Japanese, that is: land reform has been carried out, former Japanese property has been nationalized, and public education has been reformed. Laws have been published and put into effect about labor and equal rights for men and women. Bodies of political power from bottom to top are elected by the people and all strata of the population are represented in government bodies: workers, peasants, intellectuals, merchants, industrialists, etc.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">All the political and economic reforms which have been carried out are secured by the Constitution which was approved by the Supreme National Assembly in 1948.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Both the political and the economic measures being carried out by the government are going successfully.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">For example, during the election of deputies to the Supreme National Assembly of Korea in August 1948 there was a 99.9% voter turnout and they gave 98.45% of their votes to the Democratic United Front.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">The economic situation in the country is improving from year to year</span><span class="cs566403DE">. The economy is operating according to plan for the third year now.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">In 1948 the economic plan was fulfilled in all sectors. The 1949 plan was drawn up quite intensively, for example the increase of industrial production in the first half of the year was planned at 50% compared to 1948. The plan was 90.8% fulfilled for the first six months of 1949. However, the increase of production for the first half year in comparison with the first half year of 1948 was 34.6%. Agriculture also has an increase in cultivated land, a growth in the harvest, and an increase in livestock.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">The plan for agricultural tax in kind was overfulfilled by the peasants in 1947 and 1948. As a consequence of the successes in agriculture the government created state reserves. The government issues the population food monthly by food ration cards according to established norms and varieties. At the same time there is a sufficient quantity of food in the free market. However, the North Korean market is experiencing difficulties in industrial goods. Market prices continue to remain at a high level as a consequence of the shortage of industrial goods.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">In these four years there have also been great successes in North Korea in the growth of the national culture and art.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">However, there are a whole series of difficulties in North Korea which have to be overcome by the popular democratic government. These difficulties include a shortage of skilled engineering and technical personnel in industry, transportation, and agriculture and also an insufficient number of experienced and trained personnel in government institutions and public organizations.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">In spite of the solidarity of the people around the popular democratic government and the people&#39;s support for the measures which it is carrying out there nevertheless is resistance to the current political system from hostile elements.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Among those dissatisfied with the current political system are primarily the former landowners from whom land was taken away, people who actively cooperated with the Japanese, and also a certain portion of specialists who received an education in Japan and, as a rule, come from a bourgeois landowning environment. The division of the country into north and south and the presence of a reactionary government in the south of Korea is a kind of stimulant to the activity of hostile elements in the north of Korea.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">There is a growth in political crimes in 1949 compared to 1948. For example, in 1948 the political security organs uncovered 1,248 cases which involved 2,734 people. In the first half of 1949 665 cases were uncovered involving 2,771 people.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">In 1949 they are distributed by [the following] types of crimes:</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Terrorism - 622</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Espionage - 356</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Sabotage - 212</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Wrecking - 11</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Preparing an armed uprising - 221</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Distributing handbills and </span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">agitating against the current </span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">system - 1,133</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Treason - 66</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Other crimes - 160</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">The growth in political crimes in 1949 is explained on the one hand by the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Korea, which allowed reactionary elements to begin to act more boldly, and on the other by an increase of spies, saboteurs, and organizers of insurrectionist cells sent by South Korean authorities.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">The improvement of the work of government political security organizations to identify subversive activity of hostile elements also ought to be noted. The activity of hostile elements is not a great danger to the current system, however the government and the leadership of the Korean Workers Party are taking the necessary steps to combat the activity of all groups of political criminals and work is being done to increase the political vigilance of both workers of government institutions and the people.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">The Ministry has about 28,000 police, armed as a rule with Japanese rifles, to preserve public order and protect government facilities and institutions. There are three border detachments and two police brigades with a strength of about 14,000 men to protect the state border with the Soviet Union and China and also to guard the 38th parallel. They are armed with Soviet weapons. Thus, the total strength of the police forces is 42,000.</span></p><p class="cs2A4A7CB2"><span class="csA0E9A871">The Ministry of National Defense</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">The Korean democratic government has its own national army. The army was created in 1946. The main backbone of the army and primarily of its entire command personnel is former partisans who participated in the war against the Japanese both in Korea itself and in Manchuria. As of 1 August 1949 the strength of the Korean People&#39;s Army is about 80,000, including:</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">infantry divisions - five, with a total strength of 51,000 men. </span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">infantry brigade - one, with a total strength of 6,000. </span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">mechanized brigade - one, with a total strength of 6,000.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">The brigade is still not fully equipped with materiel, tanks, and artillery. There is an independent army tank regiment of 33 T-34 tanks.</span></p><p class="cs2A4A7CB2"><span class="csA0E9A871">Independent army artillery units:</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">1. An army artillery regiment of three battalions, of which two have 76 mm guns and one has 12 122 mm guns.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">2. An army anti-aircraft regiment of three battalions, one has 85 mm and two have 37 mm guns.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="csA0E9A871">Aviation</span><span class="cs566403DE">. There is an air training regiment. It is intended to form a composite air division of two regiments.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">At the present time there are 24 combat fighters, 24 combat ground attack aircraft, and 18 combat trainers, and eight trainers.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">There is a total of 26 pilots trained for flights on combat aircraft. One hundred and fifty pilots are undergoing training and it is expected that 50 will be graduated in October to fly on combat aircraft.</span></p><p class="cs2A4A7CB2"><span class="csA0E9A871">Military Educational Institutions</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">There is an officer&#39;s school which trains line, staff, and artillery officers.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">There is a political officer&#39;s school which trains political officers for all branches of the Korean People&#39;s Army.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">There is a tank training school which trains tank crew members, gunner-drivers, and radio operators.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Three Korean infantry divisions, a rifle brigade, a mechanized brigade, and artillery units have been formed along the lines of our tables of organization and equipment and equipped with our Soviet weapons. The personnel are well-trained in both firing and tactics. The training was conducted under the supervision of Soviet officer-advisers and in accordance with our wartime regulations. The officers are trained in drill and tactics, however the headquarters still have shortcomings in battle management and working out coordination between branches of troops.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">On a whole the troops have not been tested in a combat sense. However, the participation in battle of one battalion of the 1st Infantry Division in the [Kashinsky] sector shows that the troop will fight well.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Two divisions of 20,000 men arrived in July of this year from the People&#39;s Army of China. The personnel of the divisions have great combat experience of participating in battles against Nationalist Chinese troops. Both divisions are equipped with Japanese, American, and Chinese weapons. The command staff has combat experience, however they are insufficiently trained operationally and tactically.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">The Navy. The Navy of the Democratic People&#39;s Republic of Korea does not really exist. The reasons causing the northerners to raise the issue of an attack on the south. Kim Il Sung and Pak Heonyeong think that the problem of the unification of the country by peaceful means is impossible in the present situation. The Americans and South Korean reactionaries will not agree to a peaceful unification. Attempts to solve the Korean question during the work of the joint Soviet-American commission and at the subsequent UN General Assembly were unsuccessful. The creation of a patriotic front of representatives of the south and the north of Korea which include left-wing, centrist, and part of the right-wing parties of South Korea also does not guarantee the unification of the country by peaceful means. The appeal of the patriotic front about the peaceful unification of the country was rejected by the South Korean reactionaries. Accordingly, they were faced with the question of what is to be done about the unification of the country.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">They proceed from the position that an absolute majority of the people favor the unification of the country and the elimination of the 38th parallel. While American troops were in the south of the country they told the people that American troops in the south of Korea were preventing the unification of the country. There are no American troops in the country at the present time. Accordingly, this obstacle to unification has been removed. The people naturally ask what is preventing the unification of the country. In the south of Korea the reactionaries are agitating against the democratic government and against Communists, accusing them of being the obstacle to the unification of the country.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Kim Il Sung and Pak Heonyeong evidently are considering the situation and do not want to be responsible for delaying the unification of the country. Without seeing an opportunity to unify the country by peaceful means they have come to the idea of unifying the country by an armed attack against the South Korean government. They think that the people in both the north and south will support this step. Evidently they think that if unification is not done at the present time, even if by armed attack, then the issue of unification will drag on for years. The South Korean reactionaries will manage to stifle the democratic movement in the south and break up and destroy their left-wing organizations. At the same time the South Korean reactionaries are using this time to create a stronger army and might attack the north of the country in order to destroy everything that was created in the north in these years.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">In conversations Kim Il Sung and Pak Heonyeong do not want to entertain the thought that Korea should remain divided for an indefinite time. I do not exclude that Kim Il Sung, desiring to begin an attack on the south of the country, is counting on aid from both the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communist Party. Evidently he thinks that inasmuch as Koreans participated in battles against the Nationalist Chinese troops consequently the Chinese ought to help them, the Koreans.</span></p><p class="cs2A4A7CB2"><span class="csA0E9A871">My conclusions and my suggestions:</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">As before, and as I also pointed out in my note, I think that the domestic political situation both in the south and in the north of the country is favorable to our friends. The authority of the left-wing democratic forces who are fighting for the unity and independence of the country is high among the people and the measures they are pursuing enjoy the support of the broad strata of the Korean people.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">However, it is necessary to take into consideration the complexity of the international situation in which the start of an attack by the People&#39;s Army will be used by reactionary imperialist countries against the Soviet Union.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">I do not exclude that the Americans will intervene in this conflict and will give active aid to the southerners. I also think that the numerical strength of the People&#39;s Army and the logistical support which our friends have at the present time will not ensure the complete defeat of the southern army and the capture of South Korea.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">I consider it possible and advisable for our friends to generate and give every kind of support and leadership to the partisan movement in the south of Korea.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">It is possible under favorable circumstances to conduct a local operation to seize the Ongjin Peninsula and the area with the city of Kaesong. It is possible to use the provocations of the southerners at the 38th parallel for this purpose and to punish them for violations of the 38th parallel and seize the Ongjin Peninsula and the area with the city of Kaesong and thereby reduce the ground front line&hellip;</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">[&hellip;]</span></p><p class="cs7C1F8B9D"><span class="cs566403DE">T.
