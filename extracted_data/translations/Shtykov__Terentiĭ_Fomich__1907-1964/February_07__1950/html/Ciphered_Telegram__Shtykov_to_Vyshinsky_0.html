During the meeting Kim Il Sung raised the following questions:</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">1. Can they adopt a central committee decision about issuing a loan, about which he earlier asked my advice. They have already calculated the loan at 2 billion won. They have already prepared an example of a bond. He asked agreement to send their representatives to Moscow with draft bonds in order to formulate orders for these bonds. I answered that I had communicated Kim Il Sung&#39;s request to Moscow, but had still not received an answer.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">2. Kim Il Sung asked my advice about whether they can proceed toward forming three additional infantry divisions, so that the total number of the army will be brought to ten divisions. I answered that this question is large and serious, that before adopting a decision you must think through whether you have the necessary material resources for this. I also need time to think through this question before I give you advice on this measure.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">3. Kim Il Sung asked me if he can appeal to Comrade Stalin with a request to use in 1950 the credit the Soviet government had allocated for 1951. With this credit they would like to buy in the Soviet Union arms for the three infantry divisions they intend to form. I answered that I will report this question to my government.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">4. Kim Il Sung further communicated that they intend to call a session of the Supreme People&#39;s Assembly for February 25 with the following agenda:</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">1. Regarding the budget for 1950. 2. Regarding the criminal code. 3. Regarding the results of the fulfillment of the national economic plan in 1949. They still do not have a firm decision regarding whether to raise the three questions.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">&nbsp;Kim Il Sung reported that he had commissioned Pak Heon-yeong [Pak Hon Yong] to write a request to the Soviet government about sending a group of textile workers to the Soviet Union in order to prepare them to work on the Soviet equipment that is arriving. I answered that as soon as I receive his letter I will report it to my government.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">I ask your orders about what to answer Kim Il Sung regarding the first three questions raised by him [as reported] in this telegram.</span></p><p class="cs2A4A7CB2"><span class="cs566403DE"><br>7.II.50 SHTYKOV</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">[In the margins Stalin wrote &quot;it is possible&quot; beside points 1, 2 and 3, &quot;we don&#39;t object&quot; beside point 4 and &quot;let him write it&quot; beside the last paragraph. He wrote a note at the top to Malenkov to &quot;give an answer today.&quot;]</span></p></span>
