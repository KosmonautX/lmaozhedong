This information was received by the department of political security of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, which is occupied with intelligence gathering in the South. &nbsp;However, this information, which was received by Korean intelligence at the beginning of April was not reported either to the chief of counterintelligence, who is the deputy minister, or to the minister of internal affairs, and consequently was not sent to the Korean government.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">The materials received were transferred by the chief of the department of political security to our military intelligence, through which, apparently, they were also received by you.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Since this information was not reported either to the minister of internal affairs or to Prime Minister Kim Il Sung, or to our adviser at the ministry of internal affairs, I was also not informed of it.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">I consider such facts intolerable, I am taking measures toward their elimination and toward putting things in the necessary order.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">According to the information of our agents and the broadcasts of Seoul Radio, at the present time American and South Korean authorities are conducting negotiations about the withdrawal of American troops from South Korea. &nbsp;The UN Commission is also participating in these talks, which is obvious from Rhee Syngman&rsquo;s statement of 16 April, which stated: &ldquo;&hellip;Representatives of the government of the Korean Republic and the government of the USA are presently conducting negotiations about the withdrawal of American troops from Korea. &nbsp;The UN Commission on Korea has been informed of this. &nbsp;Consultation with it will be a big help in these negotiations.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">According to the statement of American ambassador Muccio on 19 April, the negotiations &ldquo;will be concluded in the course of several months.&rdquo; &nbsp;The establishment of a precise time period for the withdrawal of American troops, according to Rhee Syngman&rsquo;s statement of 19 April, &ldquo;will depend on how much time is needed to prepare the army of the Korean Republic.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">The minister of national defense of the South Korean government stated to correspondents that the South &ldquo;has a sufficient number of troops to maintain order in the country after the withdrawal of American troops and, moreover, if North Korea attacks the South, the Army of National Defense not only can withstand it, but can also inflict a perceptible blow.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">In connection with plans for a military intrusion into the North, South Korean authorities are increasing the size of the &ldquo;Army of National Defense.&rdquo;
