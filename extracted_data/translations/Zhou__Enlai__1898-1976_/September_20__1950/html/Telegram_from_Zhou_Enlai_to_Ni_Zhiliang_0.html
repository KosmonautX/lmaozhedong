		<span><p class="cs4CB833D8"><span class="cs566403DE">Comrade Ni Zhiliang:</span></p><p class="cs467231B0"><span class="cs566403DE">This is to acknowledge receipt of the September 18 telegram. &nbsp;Please tell Comrade Kim Il Sung: We think your idea of fighting a protracted war is correct. &nbsp;The courage of the North Korean army and masses is admirable. &nbsp;Enemy numbers will probably increase at Inchon, the purpose of which is to extend their lines to the east and cut North Korea&rsquo;s north-south transportation lines and also press on towards the 38th Parallel. &nbsp;The People&rsquo;s Army must do all it can to hold the area north of the 38th Parallel; [only in this way] will it be possible to carry on a protracted war.</span><span class="cs446E8E06"> &nbsp;</span><span class="cs566403DE">Therefore, please think about the question of how to preserve [your] main forces under the general policy of persisting in relying on one&rsquo;s own efforts and fighting for a long period of time so that the enemy can be destroyed one by one. &nbsp;At present, [your] main force directly faces the enemy&rsquo;s positions and both sides hold their ground. &nbsp;This means much consumption [of resources.] &nbsp;And if the enemy seizes Seoul, there is the danger that the People&rsquo;s Army&rsquo;s route of retreat will be cut off. &nbsp;Therefore, it seems appropriate that the main force of the People&rsquo;s Army should concentrate [but maintain] mobility, seek the enemy&rsquo;s weak points and destroy the enemy part by part. &nbsp;In battles, [you should] concentrate military strength. &nbsp;In every battle, pin down large numbers of the enemy in divided branches with less military strength or firepower while using more military strength [three to five times] and firepower [at least twice] with absolute superiority to surround and annihilate fewer enemies (e.g. one regiment) that have been divided by us. &nbsp;In battles, division of one&rsquo;s forces should be avoided; most of all to be avoided is putting the enemy to flight or blocking the enemy instead of destroying the enemy&rsquo;s effective strength. &nbsp;So long as you can wipe out the enemy&rsquo;s effective strength, annihilating only one regiment or one battalion is still good. &nbsp;A big victory results from the accumulation of small victories. &nbsp;They will progressively weaken the enemy and are beneficial in protracted war. If the US army&rsquo;s firepower and equipment is strong and it is temporarily difficult to charge in and break it up, it is suitable to consider targeting the Syngman Rhee puppet army [by] concentrating [your] main force and annihilating one or two regiments every time, [thereby] annihilating one or two divisions every few months. &nbsp;In half a year, the puppet army can be destroyed completely. &nbsp;These lackeys of American imperialism will be cut off, which will isolate the American imperialists and then [you can] annihilate them separately. &nbsp;Under the principles of protracted war, [one] must fully take into account the difficult side. &nbsp;Long term planning must be made in all aspects of mobilization and usage of manpower, material resources and financial resources and lower-level subordinates must be made to avoid the mentality of putting all one&rsquo;s eggs in one basket. &nbsp;The enemy seeks a quick decision [in the war] and is afraid of it becoming protracted, while our People&rsquo;s Army should avoid quick decisions and can only gain victory in a protracted war. &nbsp;As friends and comrades, we provide the above for your reference. &nbsp;Correct or not, [I] request [your] further consideration and reply.</span></p><p class="csE6BD2737"><span class="cs566403DE">Zhou Enlai</span></p><p class="csE6BD2737"><span class="cs566403DE">September 20</span></p></span>
