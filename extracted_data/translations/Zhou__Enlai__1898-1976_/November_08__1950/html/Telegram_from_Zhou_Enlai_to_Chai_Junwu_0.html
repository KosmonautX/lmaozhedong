Please tell Premier Kim [Il Sung]: (1) Concerning the matter of the Chinese People&rsquo;s Volunteer Army to Resist America, Assist North Korea, Protect Our Home and Defend Our Country (called Chinese People&rsquo;s Volunteer Army for short, not called the Chinese Volunteer Army), it can be announced to the public. &nbsp;The wording could take as a model China&rsquo;s All-Parties Joint Declaration or what was stated in the broadcast on the 7th and in the newspaper. &nbsp;Several sentences can just be given, briefly. &nbsp;There is no need to say too much. &nbsp;(2) Call on the North Korean army and people and the Chinese People&rsquo;s Volunteer Army to work together closely, learn from each other and also send out a call emphasizing that the North Korean Army and people should persist in unity and persist in the long-term struggle. &nbsp;Oppose looking at things in a gloomy manner. &nbsp;(3) The enemy has announced that the Chinese People&rsquo;s Volunteer Army has entered the war. &nbsp;So this publicity will not cause other issues internationally. &nbsp;The enemy is afraid of a long-lasting military operation in Korea, and has not prepared for a protracted war. &nbsp;So they are passive and apt to panic.</span></p><p class="csE6BD2737"><span class="cs566403DE">Zhou Enlai</span></p><p class="csE6BD2737"><span class="cs566403DE">November 8 [1950]</span></p></span>
