In accordance with the two reports described in the Chairman&rsquo;s telegram to Filippov [Stalin] as well as procedural opinions about addressing the various issues under discussion, I explained that I only have some suggestions. Perhaps it would be better to wait for Comrade Stalin to consider them first and then ask Vyshinsky to make the appropriate arrangements.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">First on our agenda we propose a visit with Comrade Stalin to describe in brief the reports that we will make and the discussions we will have. Then we will ask Comrade Stalin to give instructions. If necessary, please designate several comrades to discuss specific issues with us.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">If possible, that day I would like to talk about the Korean War and the international situation, and then arrange another appointment to report on the most important developments in China during the past three years and our overall guidelines for construction during the next five years.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">During the talks, the delegation plans to visit Chairman Nikolay Shvernik and pay tribute to Lenin. After the meetings, the delegation plans to visit Stalingrad and the Volgaton Canal.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Finally, we would like to visit comrades of the Central Committee of the Communist Party [of the Soviet Union] to discuss the organization and working methods of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">At 6 pm, I asked [Chinese Ambassador to the USSR] Zhang Wentian to visit Foreign Minister Vyshinsky. Vyshinsky said that the work agenda I suggested was very reasonable. He said that many people liked the speech yesterday when we arrived at the airport.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Regarding the international situation, he said the US, in order to increase international tensions, would drag out the Korean War for some time to come. If it drags on for another two years, the situation will get even worse for the US and NATO will near collapse. The United States is now both afraid of peace and afraid to fight. Colds and fevers are widespread on the Korean battlefield. It is a cold and fever disease on the Korean battlefield. If a world war does not break out in five years, we will be very much different. The conversation with Vyshinsky indicates that they are already mentally prepared to assist in China&#39;s construction.</span></p><p class="cs7C1F8B9D"><span class="cs566403DE">Zhou Enlai&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs7C1F8B9D"><span class="cs566403DE">August 18 at 20:00</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><a href="#_ftn_GoBack0" name="_ftn0"><sup><span class="cs5B43FB65">[1]</span></sup></a><span class="cs9A2F8768"> The editors of&nbsp;</span><span class="cs38DADAB7">Jianguo yilai Zhou Enlai wengao</span><span class="cs9A2F8768">&nbsp;(Zhou Enlai&rsquo;s Manuscripts since the Founding of the PRC) included several footnotes in this document that provided biographical information on the individuals mentioned.
