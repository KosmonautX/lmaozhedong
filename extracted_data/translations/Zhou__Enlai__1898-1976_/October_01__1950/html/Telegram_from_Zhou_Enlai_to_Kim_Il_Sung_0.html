Disperse [the other] four divisions into many small detachments in south Korea, rely on the people and persist in guerrilla war in the enemy&rsquo;s rear area, which will pin down large numbers of the enemy and prevent them from moving forward. &nbsp;To which place have the five or six divisions led by the Second Front Army retreated? &nbsp;Is it possible to withdraw all of them north of the 38th Parallel in several days? &nbsp;In brief, your armies must retreat north rapidly, the quicker the better. &nbsp;If the enemy attempts to restrain or block [the retreat], [you] should destroy heavy weapons, and retreat through gaps in the enemy&rsquo;s lines by separate paths. &nbsp;Those who cannot retreat should stay in the enemy&rsquo;s rear area and persist in dispersed guerrilla activity. &nbsp;Whether the above suggestions are appropriate or not, please reply immediately. &nbsp;[We] wish to be informed of the situation in detail.</span></p><p class="cs7C1F8B9D"><span class="cs566403DE">Zhou Enlai</span></p><p class="cs7C1F8B9D"><span class="cs566403DE">Night of October 1</span></p></span>
