We absolutely cannot agree with this kind of fake armistice and also ask that the gentlemen representatives who truly hope for peace and people over the world who love peace to try to distinguish truth from falsehood and distinguish clearly between right and wrong .</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">If representatives of our country are deprived of the right to speak at the Political Committee discussion accusing the USA of invading China, agree to distribute the text of the speech at the press conference.</span></p><p class="csE6BD2737"><span class="cs566403DE">Zhou Enlai</span></p><p class="csE6BD2737"><span class="cs566403DE">December 16 [1950]</span></p></span>
