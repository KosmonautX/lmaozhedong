According to our information, the Korean question will be discussed at the forthcoming session of the General Assembly of the UN. Regarding the question of prisoners of war Mexico has advanced a proposal consisting of 3 points, which are: first, both sides immediately conduct an exchange of prisoners who have expressed the wish to return to their homeland; second, the remaining POWs will be transferred to the temporary protection of UN member states and be subject to repatriation according to an agreement which will be concluded; third, after a normal situation is established in Korea, to guarantee that these POWs can return to their homeland and to provide them with the possibility for this. Until the restoration of a normal situation in Korea, if the POWs ask to return to their homeland, then the corresponding government also must take measures and present to them all possibilities for repatriation.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Apparently, the proposal to discuss the Korean question in the General Assembly of the UN was advanced at the initiative of England. The proposal of Mexico arose at the initiative of the USA. The latter have already expressed the wish to discuss this question in the UN General Assembly.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">We intend to express opposition to such a variant.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">I ask you to consult with comrade FILIPPOV about what our position should be on this question.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">2. India and Burma have made indications that they would like to sign a non-aggression pact with us, and also hope that you will visit these countries. The essence is that [Indian leader Jawaharlal] Nehru would like to visit China, with a view, however, that you will go to India on a return visit. We received this information from our ambassador in Burma Yao Zhongming.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">I suggest that it is highly possible that India and Burma will advance these questions for an exchange of opinion. If India and Burma make these proposals officially, then it would be inconvenient for us to refuse.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">I ask also that you consult with Comrade FILIPPOV about whether it is advisable for China to conclude such pacts with India and Burma.</span></p><p class="cs7C1F8B9D"><span class="cs566403DE">Mao Zedong.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">15 September 1952</span></p></span>
