With respect to the voting on the American amendment, please use our N&ordm; 293 (point 2 &ldquo;b&rdquo;) as guidance. This instruction also concerns the proposal about forming a provisional commission. </span></p><p class="cs3BFD1D18"><span class="cs6D7AB2B9">Second. Prior to the voting on the American amendment, you have to make a statement to the effect that, if the proposal to form a provisional commission is approved without the participation of the Koreans, then the Soviet Union will not be able to take part in the work of such a committee. </span></p><p class="cs3BFD1D18"><span class="cs6D7AB2B9">Third. Cde. Gromyko acted incorrectly and hastily when he stated as early as in his first speech who we consider representatives of the Korean people, and when he pointed out that they have to be elected by the Korean people and not appointed. </span></p><p class="cs3BFD1D18"><span class="cs6D7AB2B9">In our N&ordm; 267 we suggested not making this clarification right away, but at an opportune moment, keeping in mind that the priority be given to considering the issue of inviting the Koreans, after which it would be possible to talk about which representatives of Korea should be invited. </span></p><p class="cs3BFD1D18"><span class="cs6D7AB2B9">It can be seen from the American amendment that the Americans tried to use this premature statement by Gromyko in their interests.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs2A4A7CB2"><span class="cs6D7AB2B9">V.
