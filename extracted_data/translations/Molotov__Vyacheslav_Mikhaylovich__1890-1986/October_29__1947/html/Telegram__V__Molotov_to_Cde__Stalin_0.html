In accordance with Paragraphs 3 and 5 of your 267, you have to first of all insist on the decision about inviting the Koreans and try to ensure that the Korean issue is not discussed prior to the arrival of the Koreans. </span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs6D7AB2B9">This means that, even in case the Soviet proposal about pulling out foreign troops from Korea is discussed first, then you will still have to insist that the proposal is discussed with the participation of the Koreans.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs6D7AB2B9">A decision in favor of inviting the Koreans will inevitably lead to postponement of the discussion of the Korean issue, which is advisable.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs6D7AB2B9">2. With respect to Paragraph 2 of your proposal, please stick to the following position:</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs6D7AB2B9">a. Oppose American proposals just as you have suggested.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs6D7AB2B9">b. If they nevertheless refuse to invite the Koreans, then abstain during the voting for the American proposals, but do not vote against them, and as grounds for abstaining state that you do not deem it possible to take part in the voting without hearing out the Koreans. </span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs6D7AB2B9">3.
