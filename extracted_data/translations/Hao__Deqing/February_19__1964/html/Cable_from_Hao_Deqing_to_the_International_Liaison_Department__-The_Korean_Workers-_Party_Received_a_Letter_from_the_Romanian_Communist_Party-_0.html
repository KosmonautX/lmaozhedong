It was a telegram sent over by our embassy in Romania. The contents of the letter were more or less the same as the letter sent to the Chinese Communist Party [CCP], and proposed to cease the polemics [between the CCP and the CPSU]. In order to stop the polemics, they made some suggestions to the CPSU and the CCP. The letter also said that they will send a delegation to China.</span></p><p class="cs7C1F8B9D"><span class="cs566403DE">Hao Deqing</span></p><p class="cs7C1F8B9D"><span class="cs566403DE">19 February 1964</span></p></span>
