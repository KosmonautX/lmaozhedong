He justified it by saying that if China were to help Korea, then that would essentially draw the USSR into war.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Such a decision doesn&rsquo;t work given the overall political situation as it stands today because it would lead to a third world war, and besides that, although the Chinese army is large, they don&rsquo;t have modern weapons, aviation, and a navy. </span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">He recommended the Koreans to continue the struggle on the front and on the home front. He underscored the importance of organizing guerilla warfare. He said that Kim Il Sung can use Manchuria as if it were his own territory.</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">After a discussion of the current military situation in Korea&mdash;the Politburo of the Worker&rsquo;s Party allegedly made the decision that although there will not be any outside armed assistance, the struggle should continue, withdraw to the mountains, and prepare shock army for future offences. </span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">In South Korea they should create a guerilla movement with Ri Seung-yop [Ri Sung Yop] at its head. In the North, during the retreat, they should also establish guerilla detachments under the leadership of Pak Il-u .</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">We have not yet been directly informed about the return of Pak Il-u &nbsp;and about the meeting of the Politburo. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Matveev</span></p></span>
