He has temporarily suppressed opposition and the resistance of the people, but this situation cannot last for a long time. In his opinion, the reason of [the expected short duration of Chun&rsquo;s stable rule] is that there will be more uprisings of a similar nature as the one in Gwangju [Kwangju]. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="csD6EBF937"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Chun Doo-hwan enjoys the support of only 30 percent of the armed forces.</span></p><p class="csD6EBF937"><span class="cs5EFED22F">He expressed his appreciation of the standpoint that the press of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries adopted with regard to the South Korean events. At the same time, he let me understand that the DPRK was dissatisfied with the reactions of the Chinese press, particularly with the latter&rsquo;s failure to condemn the USA, the backer of the [Chun] regime. They could not talk publicly about [their dissatisfaction], he said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF80B0AD6"><span class="cs5EFED22F">132 &ndash; &nbsp;E. &ndash; &nbsp;</span></p></span>
