		<span><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">According to the reply of the leading MID [Soviet Foreign Ministry] official competent [to deal with such affairs], one can perceive a slow progress in Soviet-North Korean relations since the visit of Pak Seong-cheol [Pak Song Chol] in Moscow. The economic agreements are being put into effect. The Koreans have not yet given up their request for the construction of a nuclear power plant, which the Soviet side cannot fulfill. They demand the supply of an extremely great volume of arms, and the Soviet Union will partly fulfill [this demand]. During the exchange of goods this year, the Korean side has once again resorted to its usual methods; their export arrears for the first quarter of the year are substantial.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">The Korean side urges the visit of a Soviet delegation led by [Politburo member Kiril] Mazurov to Korea, which would then be followed by an official visit by Kim Il Sung to the Soviet Union. The Soviet side will fulfill this request, but in all likelihood the delegation will be led by another PB [Politburo] member, rather than the ailing Mazurov.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">The evaluation of the Soviet side is that Sino-Korean relations have become cooler in the period of the new Chinese leadership.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">-Marjai-179-</span></p></span>
