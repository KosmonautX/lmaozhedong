For days on, the television shows the film about Mengistu&rsquo;s extremely spectacular reception in Korea in sequels. On his way home, the president was accompanied by the Korean vice-president, who since then has been visiting various facilities in the companionship of Mengistu. This delegation, composed of a high number of members, will stay here until the CC [Coordinating Committee, a.k.a. Derg] session that is expected to be held in early December.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">The Koreans provide assistance on a very wide scale: &nbsp;</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">A high number of small-scale irrigation facilities, a larger hydropower station, geological surveys, military equipment, marine fishing, and so on. From an interest-free loan of six million dollars, they are constructing a shipbuilding factory. The Soviet experts in the Ministry of Agriculture have been largely replaced by Koreans. These contacts reinforce the cult around Mengistu; in my view, it is not the ideological and political identification [with North Korea] that is important for the Ethiopian side but the fact that they regard the development of this country, which is comparable to theirs, as a model applicable [to their own conditions], and that they really receive great assistance. Of course, this might also open a way for an increasing political influence.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">114 &ndash; B. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p></span>
