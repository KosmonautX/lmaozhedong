We see that Chairman Mao is in good health, and we all feel excited. This time Chairman Mao finds the time to meet us, we are very happy. At present, the situation in Vietnam and in Indo-China is complicated, and there exist some difficulties.</span></p><p class="cs865897ED"><span class="cs566403DE">Mao Zedong: Every country is facing some difficulty. The Soviet Union has its [difficulty], and the United States has its [difficulty].</span></p><p class="cs865897ED"><span class="cs566403DE">Le Duan: We are very much in need of getting Chairman Mao&rsquo;s instructions. If our Central Committee and Politburo learn that Chairman Mao has given instructions about how we should do our job, they will certainly be very happy.</span></p><p class="cs865897ED"><span class="cs566403DE">Mao Zedong: You have done a very good job, and you are doing better and better.</span></p><p class="cs865897ED"><span class="cs566403DE">Le Duan: We have tried our best to do our job. We have been able to do a good job because we have followed the three instructions Chairman Mao gave us in the past: first, no fear, we should not fear the enemy; second, we should break up the enemy one piece after another; third, we should fight a prolonged war.</span></p><p class="cs865897ED"><span class="cs566403DE">Mao Zedong: Yes, a prolonged war. You should prepare to fight a prolonged war, but isn&rsquo;t it better if the war is shortened?</span></p><p class="cs865897ED"><span class="cs566403DE">Who fears whom? Is it you, the Vietnamese, Cambodians, and the people in Southeast Asia, who fear the U.S. imperialists? Or is it the U.S. imperialists who fear you? This is a question which deserves consideration and study. It is a great power which fears a small country&mdash;when the grass bends as the wind blows, the great power will be in panic. It is true that during the Gulf of Tonkin Incident in 1964 you hit the U.S. imperialists, but it was not your intention to fight a war with the U.S. Navy. In actuality, you did not really hit it [the U.S. naval ship], but they themselves became nervous, saying that Vietnam&rsquo;s torpedo boats were coming and began opening fire. At the end, even the Americans themselves did not know if there had been a genuine [Vietnamese torpedo attack] or not. The journalists in various places of the United States believed that there had never been [such an attack], and that it was a false alarm. Since the war had already begun, there was no other choice but to fight it. The munition makers and dealers are benefiting from it.</span></p><p class="cs865897ED"><span class="cs566403DE">American presidents have had much less sleep every night [since then]. Nixon says that he uses his main energy in dealing with Vietnam.</span></p><p class="cs865897ED"><span class="cs566403DE">Now there is another person, Prince Sihanouk. He is not an easy person to deal with either. When you offend him, he will come out to scold you.</span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftn_GoBack1"><sup><span class="cs897A2406">[2]</span></sup></a></p><p class="cs865897ED"><span class="cs566403DE">Some of our embassies, in my opinion, need to be rectified. Great-power chauvinism exists in some of the Chinese embassies. They only see the shortcomings of the others, paying no attention to the interests of the whole. Who was the last [Chinese] ambassador to Vietnam?</span></p><p class="cs865897ED"><span class="cs566403DE">Zhou Enlai: Zhu Qiwen.</span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftn_GoBack2"><sup><span class="cs897A2406">[3]</span></sup></a></p><p class="cs865897ED"><span class="cs566403DE">Mao Zedong: Zhu Qiwen had very bad relations with you. As a matter of fact, Zhu Qiwen was a member of the Guomindang, and he planned to escape abroad. We did not know that he was a Guomindang member. Since you were coping with the Guomindang, how could he fail to make trouble for you? We did not know at that time, but we were not happy when we saw those telegrams [he sent back].</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE"> </span></p><p class="cs865897ED"><span class="cs566403DE">Le Duan: We Vietnamese people keep Chairman Mao&rsquo;s great goodness always in our mind. During the nine years of the war of resistance against the French, if there had not been the support from the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, it would have been impossible for us to win the victory. Why are we in a position to persist in fighting a prolonged war, especially in fighting a prolonged war in the South? Why dare we fight a prolonged war? This is mainly because we have been dependent upon Chairman Mao&rsquo;s works.</span></p><p class="cs865897ED"><span class="cs566403DE">Mao Zedong: This is not necessarily true.</span></p><p class="cs865897ED"><span class="cs566403DE">Le Duan: Of course this is true. We also need to apply [Chairman Mao&rsquo;s teachings] to Vietnam&rsquo;s practical situation.</span></p><p class="cs865897ED"><span class="cs566403DE">Mao Zedong: You have had your own creations. How can one say that you do not have your own creation and experience? Ngo Dinh Diem murdered 160,000 [of your people]. This was reported to me, and I did not know if it was accurate, but I know that over 100,000 people had been killed.</span></p><p class="cs865897ED"><span class="cs566403DE">Le Duan: Yes, 160,000 had been killed, and many others had been put into prison.</span></p><p class="cs865897ED"><span class="cs566403DE">Mao Zedong: I think this is good. You can kill our people, why can&rsquo;t we kill your people?</span></p><p class="cs865897ED"><span class="cs566403DE">Le Duan: Exactly. In 1969 alone we have killed and wounded 610,000 enemies, among whom 230,000 were Americans.</span></p><p class="cs865897ED"><span class="cs566403DE">Mao Zedong: The Americans do not have enough manpower to distribute in the world, since already they have been overextended. Therefore, when their people were killed their hearts were broken. The death of several dozens of thousand is a huge matter for them. You Vietnamese, both in the North and the South, in my opinion, it is inevitable for some of you also to be killed.</span></p><p class="cs865897ED"><span class="cs566403DE">Le Duan: Our current ways of fighting cause low casualties. Otherwise, it is impossible for us to persist for a long time.</span></p><p class="cs865897ED"><span class="cs566403DE">Mao Zedong: That is true. Maybe the situation in Laos is more difficult. Are there any people of Lao nationality living in China?</span></p><p class="cs865897ED"><span class="cs566403DE">Zhou Enlai: There are some.</span><span class="cs55BD4205"> </span><span class="cs566403DE">Mao Zedong: Where are they?</span><span class="cs55BD4205"> </span><span class="cs566403DE">Zhou Enlai: In Yunnan province, the areas bordering Laos. Mao Zedong: Is that Xishuangbanna?</span><span class="cs55BD4205"> </span><span class="cs566403DE">Huang Yongsheng: There are some living in Xishuangbanna. Zhou Enlai: Our Zhuang people are very similar to them.</span></p><p class="cs865897ED"><span class="cs566403DE">Mao Zedong: When the fighting has entered a decisive stage in Laos in the future, we may recruit some Zhuang people in Guangxi and some Dai people in Yunnan. The Zhuang people have a great fighting capacity. In the past the warlords Bai Chongxi and Li Zongren were dependent upon the Zhuang people. How many are the Zhuang people now? Eight million?</span></p><p class="cs865897ED"><span class="cs566403DE">Zhou Enlai: There are more now, over ten million.</span></p><p class="cs865897ED"><span class="cs566403DE">Mao Zedong: This is the ethnic group of Wei Guoqing&rsquo;s, which he did not acknowledge. I once asked him, to which nationality he belonged and if he belonged to one of the minority nationalities. He said that he was a Han. Only later did he acknowledge that he was a Zhuang.</span></p><p class="cs865897ED"><span class="cs566403DE">Zhou Enlai: The soldiers of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom were capable of fighting. Some of them were Zhuang people.</span></p><p class="cs865897ED"><span class="cs566403DE">Mao Zedong: Some of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom&rsquo;s troops were from Guangxi.</span></p><p class="cs865897ED"><span class="cs566403DE">Le Duan: The Nung nationality in Vietnam are also capable of fighting. They and the Zhuang people in Guangxi belong to the same nationality.</span></p><p class="cs865897ED"><span class="cs566403DE">Mao Zedong: Southeast Asia is a hornets&rsquo; nest. The people in Southeast Asia are awakening day by day. Some pacifists think that cocks like fighting. How can there be so many cocks? Now even hens like fighting.</span></p><p class="cs865897ED"><span class="cs566403DE">Le Duan: There is no way out if one does not fight.</span></p><p class="cs865897ED"><span class="cs566403DE">Mao Zedong: Yes, there is no way out if one does not fight. You [Mao speaks rhetorically to the Americans] compel the others [to fight] and leave them no other way to go. You are bullying them.</span></p><p class="cs865897ED"><span class="cs566403DE">Le Duan: The people in Cambodia and Laos are believers of Buddhism who do not like fighting. Now they have also become fond of fighting.</span></p><p class="cs865897ED"><span class="cs566403DE">Mao Zedong: This is true. You cannot say that they are not fond of fighting because they believe in Buddhism. The Chinese are also believers in Buddhism, but the 1911 Revolution was followed by seventeen years of fighting. Later it became the fighting between two factions [among the revolutionaries], and thus the people had been educated. Then the Northern Expedition War began, and then the Red Army emerged. Then the Japanese invaded China. After the surrender of the Japanese, Jiang Jieshi fought a war against us. The war lasted for less than four years, he could not continue and fled to Taiwan. He now claims at the United Nations that he represents the whole China. He had very close relations with several of us. I met with Jiang Jieshi quite a few times. When the Guomindang held its Central Committee plenum in Guangzhou I met him. I was a member of the Guomindang. I was a person who shared the membership of two parties. I was a Central Committee member of the Communist party and I was an alternate member of the Central Committee of the Guomindang. During that period several of us joined [the Guomindang]. Our premier [Zhou Enlai] was director of the Political Affairs Department of Jiang Jieshi&rsquo;s Huangpu Military Academy and deputy party representative of Jiang Jieshi&rsquo;s First Army. I do not need to mention Comrade Lin Biao. He was Jiang Jieshi&rsquo;s student. He studied at Huangpu for nine months. In China, there are very few among the people of the old generation who had not dealt with him [Jiang Jieshi].</span></p><p class="cs865897ED"><span class="cs566403DE">Lin Biao: I was also a member of both parties.</span></p><p class="cs865897ED"><span class="cs566403DE">Mao Zedong: Even the party branches of the Guomindang were all organized with our help. Without the help from the Communist Party, it would have been impossible for the Guomindang to conduct the North Expedition. At that time, the Guomindang had no party organization, no party branch, in areas along the Yellow River in the North. It depended upon the Communist Party to help it.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">In addition, we also conducted workers&rsquo; movements and farmers&rsquo; movements. The Guomindang made use of this thing; it was beneficial to [the Guomindang]. &nbsp;For the first year of the Northern Expedition it made use of [our organizing], and the second year it massacred us. &nbsp;1926 was the Northern Expedition, and in 1927 [they] massacred us. &nbsp;Now this Cambodian prince remains on our side; this, too, is very rare. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s been sixteen years, and to look at him it seems he is still not afraid of the Communist Party. </span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Zhou Enlai: &nbsp;On the contrary, Prince Sihanouk now often makes mention of the country&rsquo;s jungle fighters, and does not emphasize</span><a name="_ftn_GoBack0"><span class="cs566403DE"> Communists like Xiu M</span></a><span class="cs566403DE">u.</span><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftn_GoBack3"><sup><span class="cs897A2406">[4]</span></sup></a><span class="cs566403DE"> </span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Mao Zedong: Aren&rsquo;t you going to see him? &nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Zhou Enlai: Comrade Le Duan is going to see him. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Le Duan: In 1956, when I was working in the south, I heard of Sihanouk&rsquo;s visit to China, and I was very happy. &nbsp;I immediately left the south and went to Phnom Penh; we also convened the Cochinchina [Southern Administrative Division] Party Committee there. &nbsp;</span><span class="csC98BA9AD">(Note: When France ruled Vietnam, it divided the latter into three &ldquo;administrative divisions&rdquo;[qi]: South, North and Central; the &ldquo;Southern Administrative Division Party Committee&rdquo; refers to the Party Committee meeting in Vietnam&rsquo;s southern area.)</span><span class="cs566403DE"> &nbsp;At the time I asked Sihanouk whether he would allow some of our resistance fighters</span><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftn_GoBack4"><sup><span class="cs897A2406">[5]</span></sup></a><span class="cs566403DE"> to go to Phnom Penh. &nbsp;He sympathized with us at the time.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Mao Zedong: Now there is no way he can leave you [plural]. If he left you and the Khmer Rouge, what could he do? &nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Le Duan: &nbsp;In my observation, ever since the victory of China&rsquo;s revolution he has been mulling over [the idea that] that Southeast Asia will surely all be the Communist Party&rsquo;s one day.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Mao Zedong: Right.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Zhou Enlai: &nbsp;He also said when talking to reporters, It might be better if I could become pink</span><a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftn_GoBack5"><sup><span class="cs897A2406">[6]</span></sup></a><span class="cs566403DE"> right now! &nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Kang Sheng: &nbsp;He said that Chairman Mao told him to read books on Marxism. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Mao Zedong: &nbsp;Many years ago I said to him, &nbsp;&ldquo;Why do you have to be the king? &nbsp;I told him to read two books on Marxism: one was the </span><span class="csC98BA9AD">Communist Manifesto</span><span class="cs566403DE">, the other was </span><span class="csC98BA9AD">Socialism from [Utopian] Fantasy to Scientific Development.</span><a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftn_GoBack6"><sup><span class="cs800C9529">[7]</span></sup></a><span class="csC98BA9AD"> &nbsp;</span><span class="cs566403DE">He said, I can&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m old; this is my son&rsquo;s affair.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">The world is a very strange place. &nbsp;190 years ago, when the Americans were opposing the British, America&rsquo;s population was only three million, while the British popular was perhaps 20 million or more; there were British colonies all over the world. &nbsp;In fact, the main body of Americans, the main portion [of America] was British people. &nbsp;[As] British people, they wanted to oppose the British people, wouldn&rsquo;t you say that&rsquo;s strange?</span></p><p class="cs865897ED"><span class="cs566403DE">Le Duan: Recently Nixon claimed that the United States had never been defeated in the past 190 years. He meant that this time it would not be willing to be defeated by Vietnam.</span></p><p class="cs865897ED"><span class="cs566403DE">Mao Zedong: Never defeated?</span></p><p class="cs865897ED"><span class="cs566403DE">Le Duan: In actuality it has been defeated several times. In China, in Korea, and during the anti-French war in Indo-China. The Americans covered 80 percent of France&rsquo;s military expenditures. Still it was defeated.</span></p><p class="cs865897ED"><span class="cs566403DE">Mao Zedong: That is true. You mentioned a moment ago that first of all one should not fear the imperialists. After all, who really fears whom? Small countries. There exists such a problem on the part of small nations. It will gradually try. After trying for a few years, it will understand.</span></p><p class="cs865897ED"><span class="cs566403DE">During China&rsquo;s Tang Dynasty there was an author, Liu Zongyuan, who wrote a fable called &ldquo;The Guizhou Donkey Has Exhausted His Tricks.&rdquo;</span><a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftn_GoBack7"><sup><span class="cs897A2406">[8]</span></sup></a><span class="cs566403DE"> [We] can translate it and read it to you. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s al</span><a name="_ftn_GoBack5"><span class="cs566403DE">ways the big who fear the smal</span></a><span class="cs566403DE">l,</span><a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftn_GoBack8"><sup><span class="cs897A2406">[9]</span></sup></a><span class="cs566403DE"> then the small gradually test [the situation] and [realize] the big ones aren&rsquo;t scary at all. &nbsp;In the beginning, this Party of ours had only 70 people, everyone looked down on us; it was only after many setbacks that [we] started to gradually learn a thing or two. &nbsp;You are all probably more or less clear on this. </span></p><p class="cs865897ED"><span class="cs566403DE">As for the Cultural Revolution going on now, there are many people who do not understand it. &nbsp;It is not only foreign comrades or friends who do not understand; there are many among us who do not understand, either.</span></p><p class="cs865897ED"><span class="cs566403DE">I&rsquo;ll give an example: near Beijing is the February 7th Locomotive Factory. &nbsp;This factory had over 8,000 people; 40,000 people including the families. &nbsp;But it had never been [politically] cleaned up. &nbsp;Now the moment [we] started to clear it [we found] there were three branches of the Guomindang; they are called district branches. &nbsp;Besides that, there were three branches of the Guomindang&rsquo;s Three Principles of the People Youth League. &nbsp;That is what is being cleared out this time. &nbsp;Beijing has a big printing factory with several thousand workers called Xinhua Printing Factory: it prints paper money, books and leaflets. &nbsp;In the Beiyang warlord era it served Yuan Shikai, and after the Northern Expedition it served the Guomindang; when the Japanese invaded, it served the Japanese; after the Japanese surrendered, it served the Guomindang again, and after we defeated the Guomindang it served us. &nbsp;You see, those who served all those different masters</span><a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftn_GoBack9"><sup><span class="cs897A2406">[10]</span></sup></a><span class="cs566403DE"> hadn&rsquo;t been cleared out, and there was a whole mess of characters in there. &nbsp;All the country&rsquo;s factories are like that, more or less.

They are people like Liu Shaoqi, Peng Zhen and Lu Dingyi. &nbsp;Peng Zhen is in charge of the city of Beijing, as well as part of the [Party] Central Secretariat. &nbsp;Lu Dingyi is also Guomindang. &nbsp;Has he admitted it himself? </span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Zhou Enlai: &nbsp;Yes, he wrote [the confession] himself. &nbsp;Besides that, there is also circumstantial evidence. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Mao Zedong: &nbsp;He is in charge of the Propaganda Department. &nbsp;The head of the Organization Department, An Ziwen, is also Guomindang. &nbsp;As for Deng Xiaoping, he&rsquo;s a bit different from them; he has not been found to have these problems.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">So, I say that we only have half of Beijing, at most.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Our former Chief of the General Staff Luo Ruiqing was a Communist Party member who had never entered the Communist Party. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Lin Biao: A fake Party member.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Mao Zedong: He had never entered the Party; he was a phoney. &nbsp;China has many people, and there are many things going on; it&rsquo;s extremely complicated, we [as a] minority are at a loss. &nbsp;Whether it&rsquo;s veiled struggle or open strife, we cannot defeat them; [but if we] mobilize the masses, there&rsquo;s nothing they can do. &nbsp;Foreign friends don&rsquo;t understand this part; they say, What are you up to? &nbsp;Today it&rsquo;s down with Zhou Enlai, tomorrow it&rsquo;s down with Ye Jianying, the day after tomorrow it&rsquo;s down with Li Xiannian. &nbsp;Now [they] understand, there was this clique, a secret clique, called the May 16th Regiment, which took this as an opportunity to try and seize power. &nbsp;So, we didn&rsquo;t understand some of it ourselves: why was it that today it was down with Zhou Enlai, tomorrow down with Li Xiannian, the day after tomorrow Ye Jianying, Chen Yi, Nie Rongzhen, Zhu De, Chen Yun &ndash; [why] it was down with all these old comrades. &nbsp;[We] only knew later that it was all mainly their doing. &nbsp;We couldn&rsquo;t even understand it, how could you?

At that time, I also told you that if the Americans did not come to China&rsquo;s borders, and if you did not invite us, we would not dispatch our troops [to enter the war].</span></p><p class="cs865897ED"><span class="cs566403DE">Le Duan: This was also what we thought. When we are still able to continue the fighting, we hope to make our &ldquo;great rear&rdquo; more stable. When we Vietnamese are fighting the Americans, China is our &ldquo;great rear.&rdquo; Therefore, we once issued such instructions that even though our planes had been attacked they should not land at the airports in China.</span></p><p class="cs865897ED"><span class="cs566403DE">Mao Zedong: You can [land at our airports]. We do not fear. If the American air force come to attack the &ldquo;shelters&rdquo; of Vietnamese air force, let them come.</span></p><p class="cs865897ED"><span class="cs566403DE">Le Duan: Although we issued such instructions, still we needed to rely on your support. At that time, you dispatched several divisions to Vietnam, also engaged in fighting American planes.</span></p><p class="cs865897ED"><span class="cs566403DE">Mao Zedong: That is true. The Americans are afraid of being beaten, and they have no guts. You may negotiate [with the Americans]. I am not saying that you cannot negotiate, but your main energy should be put on fighting. Who sabotaged the two Geneva conferences? Both you and us truthfully abided by [the resolutions of the conferences]. But they did not. It is better that they did not.</span></p><p class="cs865897ED"><span class="cs566403DE">Therefore, even Premier Kosygin of the Soviet Union, when making a public speech, had to say that as long as convening an international conference was concerned, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia must be consulted. Many of their current leaders I am not familiar with, I do not know them. I know Kosygin and have talked with him. The newspapers in the West frequently make rumors about them, saying how divided is their leadership. I am not clear about this either. It is said that the common people are more interested in Kosygin as a leader.</span></p><p class="cs865897ED"><span class="cs566403DE">Le Duan: We have also heard it.</span></p><p class="cs865897ED"><span class="cs566403DE">Mao Zedong: You have also heard it? In my opinion, Stalin is alive again. The main tendency in the world today is revolution, including the whole world. There exists the possibility that the big powers may start a world war. But, because of a few atomic bombs, no one dares to start the war. This mainly concerns the two superpowers. At present many say that there are three big powers. China should not be included. China&rsquo;s study of making nuclear weapons is a recent experience.</span><a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftn_GoBack16"><sup><span class="cs897A2406">[17]</span></sup></a><span class="cs566403DE"> We are at the stage of research.
