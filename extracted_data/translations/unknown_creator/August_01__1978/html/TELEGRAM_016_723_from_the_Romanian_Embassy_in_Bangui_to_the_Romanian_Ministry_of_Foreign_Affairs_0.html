In this respect, it sent its ambassador to Washington as special envoy of the South Korean president; as Emperor Bokassa was away, the South Korean special envoy was received by the Central African Prime Minister. The [South Korean] special envoy relayed an invitation for Emperor Bokassa to visit South Korea, [which would allow] the two countries to discuss the possibilities for developing their political and economic relations. North Korean diplomats are closely following the actions of the Seoul regime and they admit that Emperor Bokassa managed to draw them into a competition [for the Central African Empire]. The DPRK believes that in the future evolution of its relations with the Central African Empire there will be favorable conditions for the DPRK to determine the Central African Empire to break off diplomatic relations with South Korea.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">Our embassy [estimates] that this goal of the DPRK cannot be achieved, knowing the ability of Emperor Bokassa and the fact that the two countries are members of the UN. At the same time, we believe there are no serious reasons to determine the Central African Empire to take such a radical political decision.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">Written by M.
