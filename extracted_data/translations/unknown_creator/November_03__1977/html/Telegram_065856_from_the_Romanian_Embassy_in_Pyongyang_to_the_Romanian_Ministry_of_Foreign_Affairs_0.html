The current Chinese leadership, as well as the USSR and other countries, have declined any support or implication in a potential Korean War, advising North Korean leaders to avoid clashes that could escalate into a military confrontation. The DPRK alone would not be able to withstand the combined American and South Korean forces. As such, North Korea will intensify its efforts of finding new ways to close in the people from both sides and of becoming increasingly active internationally.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">President Tito noted that this is the only possible position the DPRK could assume given the current global configuration.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Drafted by C.
