[&hellip;]</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">On my inquiry about the latest developments of Korean-Vietnamese relations, the charg&eacute; d&rsquo;affaires stated that no new elements have been added to their relations. [Their relations] have remained unchanged, that is, they are good; [the two countries], at their discretion, mutually support each other&rsquo;s struggle against aggressive American imperialism as far as they can. At the same time the charg&eacute; d&rsquo;affaires drew my attention to the declaration that the DRV F[oreign] M[inistry] had made on July 20, on the 16th anniversary of the Geneva Agreements. According to the charg&eacute; d&rsquo;affaires, this declaration well demonstrates the DRV standpoint on [the idea of] the common front of the &ldquo;five Asian countries,&rdquo; which has been recently so much emphasized by the Korean comrades. That is, the Vietnamese standpoint has remained unaltered, he said; since American imperialism is an enemy of every socialist country and of the entire mankind, not only of the &ldquo;five countries,&rdquo; </span><span class="csC98BA9AD">it is necessary to achieve cooperation not only between the &ldquo;five countries&rdquo; but also between all anti-imperialist forces</span><span class="cs566403DE"> [emphasis in the original], and the main force of anti-imperialist struggle is not confined to the common front of a few countries but encompasses </span><span class="csC98BA9AD">the whole socialist camp</span><span class="cs566403DE"> [emphasis in the original], for whose unity they, Vietnamese Communists, are fighting in the spirit of [1st President of Democratic Republic of Vietman] Comrade Ho Chi Minh&rsquo;s last will. The charg&eacute; d&rsquo;affaires asked how I evaluated the recent visit of a Korean military delegation in Beijing. I replied that I considered it [an event] whose importance was greater than that of a simple protocol or return visit. On his part, the charg&eacute; d&rsquo;affaires added that in his view, [the visit] was a direct consequence of the Korean-Chinese joint communiqu&eacute; that had been made in April [&hellip;].</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">[Signature]</span></p></span>
