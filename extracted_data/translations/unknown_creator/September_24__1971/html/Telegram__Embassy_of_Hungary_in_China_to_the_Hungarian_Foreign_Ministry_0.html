He also discussed this with Deputy Foreign Minister Qiao Guanhua, who is of the opinion that the previous Chinese standpoint was wrong, by now China has become aware of that the South Korean situation is unsuitable for armed unification. In April the [South Korean] aggressors eliminated all [South Korean] forces which would have supported [armed unification]. In the opinion of the Poles, the current Korean standpoint on this issue is identical with the Chinese one, this is one [of the factors] which make their current relationship so close. The Koreans hope that if the Sino-American negotiations result in an American decision to make a compromise, Korea may also gain advantage. Since the DPRK is afraid of Japanese militarism, it finds it necessary to improve its relations with the Chinese and the Soviets.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">&ndash; 221 &ndash;</span></p></span>
