The same legislation stipulates the sum of 275 million dollars as credits for selling military equipment.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">This turn of events allow the continuation of the retreat of US troops at the proposed rate &ndash; 2400 soldiers by the end of the current year and 3600 soldiers in 1979.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">Regarding the discussion of the Korean question at the [next] session of UN General Assembly, the US has no clue if the Korean question is on the agenda and it &nbsp;hopes that it will not be [introduced], because such discussion would be sterile and detrimental to the discussion of problems of immediate concern.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">Regarding the attitude of the Democratic People&rsquo;s Republic of Korea, the American diplomat mentioned one aspect which [he noticed] in the recent speech of the president Kim Il Sung in which he said that for the peaceful reunification of Korea 3 conditions are necessary: the modifications of South Korea&rsquo;s constitution , the liberty of the political parties, and the change of the South Korean government. The novelty of this remark consists in the fact that until now, the three conditions were referring to the beginning of the discussions for reunification, which hints to the fact that the North Koreans wish to resume the North-South discussions. Of course, this declaration will have to be confirmed by the actions that the North Koreans will undertake.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">An interesting element is the attitude of the Soviet Union towards South Korea. Lately, a South Korean sport team has performed in the USSR and the South Korean ministry of health was granted the permission to take part that the session of the World Health Organization, but he also requested a separate meeting with the minister of health of USSR. The US interprets this attitude as a wish of the USSR to initiate economic relations with South Korea, which has one of the prosperous economies in the Pacific region.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">Signed</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Ion Besteliu</span></p></span>
