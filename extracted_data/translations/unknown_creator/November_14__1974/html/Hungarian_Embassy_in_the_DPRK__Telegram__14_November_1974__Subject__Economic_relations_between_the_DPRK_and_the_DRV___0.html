		<span><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">According to the information I received from a Vietnamese source, problems have occurred in DRV-DPRK trade and in the field of Korean aid shipments. (In 1974, DPRK exports to the DRV stand at 120.000 rubles, while its imports are 300.000 rubles. In 1974, the value of Korean aid is 2 million rubles; if the delayed shipment of earlier aid supplies is included, it is precisely 3 million rubles.) It has very gravely affected the DRV that the DPRK has not supplied yet any chemical fertilizer. There are also delays in the supply of steel, non-ferrous metals, and other raw materials. The Korean side claims that the delayed shipments are caused by domestic difficulties and transport problems. The Vietnamese side tacitly disapproves that in 1974, the DPRK exports substantial quantities of rice (e.g., to Indonesia), but it does not sell or supply rice to the DRV.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">T. &nbsp;</span></p></span>
