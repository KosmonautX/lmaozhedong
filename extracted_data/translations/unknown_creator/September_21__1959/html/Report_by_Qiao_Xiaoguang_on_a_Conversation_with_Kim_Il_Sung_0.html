He expressed that he fully supports the resolutions of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, [as well as] China&rsquo;s Great Leap Forward, the People&rsquo;s Communes, our general [political] line, and our opposition to Peng Dehuai&rsquo;s right opportunist anti-Party clique. Kim said that the Korean [Workers&rsquo;] Party is not surprised by Peng Dehuai&rsquo;s opposition to the [Chinese Communist] Party and that this is [in fact] completely understandable. The Central Committee of the Korean Workers&rsquo; Party had quite a few concerns about Peng Dehuai in the past, but did not raise these [questions about Peng to the Chinese Communist Party] out of a broader interest in protecting the unity of the two [Chinese and Korean] parties. During the trip to Beijing, [Kim said that] [Mao and Liu] might find an opportunity to discuss this issue with our Party.</span></p><p class="cs1157FFE2"><span class="cs987C76A8">Qiao Xiaoguang</span></p><p class="cs1157FFE2"><span class="cs987C76A8">21 September 1959</span></p></span>
