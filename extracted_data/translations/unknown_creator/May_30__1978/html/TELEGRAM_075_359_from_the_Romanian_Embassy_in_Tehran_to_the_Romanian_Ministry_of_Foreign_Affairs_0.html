At the same time, [Iran] is [sending them] a warning (especially the US against the opposition to deliver the advanced weapons systems Iran had requested) that the Iranian government can adopt a rapprochement policy with socialist states and [a policy of] relative distancing from the West, if Iran is not granted the appropriate attention and importance.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs9633BC1">In essence, however, Iran&rsquo;s foreign policy will continue to be based on its close alliance with the US, on whose support [Iran] is counting in case a conflict breaks out.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs9633BC1">Signed</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs9633BC1">Al.
