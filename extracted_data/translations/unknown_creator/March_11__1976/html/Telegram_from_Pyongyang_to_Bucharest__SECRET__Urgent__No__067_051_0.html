The United States of America is introducing increasing quantities of weapons, which aggravates the danger of a conflict breaking out in the peninsula. </span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">The struggle of the popular masses in South Korea is intensifying, rising against the anti-popular regime of Park Chung Hee and in favor of a democratic society and the acceleration of the process for the reunification of the homeland.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">It can be seen, the Korean diplomat said, that currently, the danger of a war breaking out is becoming more and more obvious. Given the active American presence in the Peninsula, the Korean matter is no longer a regional problem, but an international problem on whose resolution peace in Asia and in the entire world depends.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">In this context, it is necessary for all the peoples of the world to intensify their efforts to condemn the interference of the United States of America in the internal affairs of Korea, to follow closely and to actively support the just struggle of the Korean people, to take decisive actions with a view to turning the UN resolution on the Korean matter into reality.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">Signature: illegible</span></p></span>
