The Vietnamese side stands completely aloof from them, the press also failed to publish news about this event.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">On my inquiry, the deputy head of the regional department of the [North Vietnamese] F[oreign] M[inistry] said only that the agreements would not achieve the withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">According to the evaluation of fraternal diplomats, the Vietnamese received the agreement with disappointment. It gave rise to the feeling that they remained alone in the armed struggle against U.S. imperialism, since by now every socialist country [save the DRV] has had talks and made compromises with the opposing camp. In their view, both China and Korea took advantage of the achievements of the bloody struggle that the Vietnamese people had waged against American imperialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">&ndash; 241 &ndash; A. &ndash;</span></p></span>
