During the party, they propagated the position of the Albanian leadership and its destructive line. Besides the Korean students, Chinese and Vietnamese students also took part. According to the Hungarian comrades, the refreshments were provided by the Chinese embassy. </span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE"><br>The most important guest at the party was Kim Il Sung&#39;s son, who is a student at Kim Il Sung University and has been reportedly maintaining very close friendly relations with the Albanian students for some time. He has been inviting them home to meet his family. Before their state holiday, the Albanian students, after lengthy discussions with the Korean comrades, succeeded in securing permission to hang portraits of Stalin in their rooms. After the initial animosity against Albanian students that began to be apparent among Korean students after the 22nd Congress, when the latter became acquainted with the materials of the congress in Russian, the Albanian students launched a major initiative to gain the sympathy of both Korean students and students from other countries. A great help to them was precisely Kim Il Sung&#39;s son, who as early as the time of the Albanians&#39; arrival in the DPRK headed the welcoming committee and organized a warm welcome for them. Among the students of the university, Kim Il Sung&#39;s son has been enjoying great respect and has tremendous influence on their thinking. </span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE"><br></span><span class="cs566403DE">Kohou&scaron;ek</span><span class="cs566403DE"> 141<br/><br/></span></p></span>
