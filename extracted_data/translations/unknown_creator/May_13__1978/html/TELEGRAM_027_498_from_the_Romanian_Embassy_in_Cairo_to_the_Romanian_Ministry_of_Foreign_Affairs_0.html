			<li class="cs93CA77EA"><span class="cs566403DE">President Sadat&rsquo;s peace initiative is regarded by the Democratic People&rsquo;s Republic of Korea as a positive, courageous and realistic act. &nbsp;</span></li></ol>
		<p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">President Sadat decided to move to direct negotiations because the resolution of the crisis in the region according with the help of previous methods reached a standstill.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">It is not true that Sadat is trying to strike a separate peace with Israel, those who assert such things are gravely mistaken.
