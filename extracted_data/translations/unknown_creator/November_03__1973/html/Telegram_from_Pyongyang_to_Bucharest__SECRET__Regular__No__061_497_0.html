After interrupting the dialogue with the South, both parties, but especially the North, vehemently attacks South Korea, which basically leads to the state of tension preceding the signing of the Joint Communiqu&eacute; from 4 July 1972.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">According to press reports and radio broadcasts, party and community organizations, all the cadres in all the units discuss the speech of Comrade Kim Il Sung at the rally in Pyongyang organized on the occasion of Todor Zhivkov&rsquo;s visit to the DPRK. These press reports and broadcasts contain strong ideas that peace in the Korean peninsula is endangered, that the peace announced by the American imperialists and the South Korean puppets is nothing else but a fa&ccedil;ade behind which the enemies of the Korean people are preparing a new war against the North, that peace must be conquered and defended with weapons, etc.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">In a recent discussion between the Romanian Ambassador and the Vice-Premier of the Administrative Council, Heo Dam [Ho Tam], the latter expressed his skepticism regarding the capability of the United Nations Organization to bring something new [to the table] to solve the Korean problem, showing that history demonstrated that plenty of the resolutions and decisions of this organization were ignored.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F"> Regarding the situation described above, at their turn, the South Korean authorities are manifesting a lot of concern regarding the &ldquo;warmongering agitation and the provocations of the North,&rdquo; regarding the frequent infiltrations in the South of some elements that prepared and supported the recent student movements in Seoul.</span></p></span>
