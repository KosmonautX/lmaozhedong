Kotb, we gathered the following:</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs9633BC1">With respect to North Korea&rsquo;s relations with Arab countries, [Pyongyang] is paying special attention to its relations with Egypt.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs9633BC1">In this respect, we would like to note the participation of the Egyptian governmental delegation at the ceremonies celebrating 30 years since the creation of the DPRK. The Egyptian delegation, led by Mustapha Kamal Helmi, the Egyptian Minister of Education and State Minister for Scientific Research, visited the DPRK on September 8-13, 1978.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs9633BC1">On September 11, the delegation was received by the DPRK President Kim Il Sung. On this occasion, the head of the Egyptian governmental delegation transmitted a friendly support message, from the Egyptian President, Anwar al-Sadat, for the supreme cause of the Korean people &ndash; the peaceful and independent reunification of the motherland. </span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs9633BC1">In his reply, President Kim Il Sung, after having thanked for the message, asked [the Egyptian delegation] to send a peace and friendship message, and [his wishes] for the happiness and prosperity of the Egyptian people. Then President Kim Il Sung presented the position of the DPRK toward the Egyptian government and people, expressing the &ldquo;support and adhesion of the Korean government toward the activity and the foreign policy actions of president Anwar al-Sadat on the Arab-Israeli conflict.&rsquo; </span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs9633BC1">The [North] Korean head of state pointed out that the DPRK was closely following the evolution of events in the Middle East and that [the DPRK] &lsquo;supports any peace initiative launched by Egypt,&rsquo; including the tripartite high-level meeting in Camp David, which he regards as &lsquo;as new step&rsquo; in the direction of finding a peaceful resolution for the [Middle East] conflict.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs9633BC1">The DPRK, added President Kim Il Sung, will continue to support, at many levels, the position and politics of Egypt, but it cannot publicly express this for the moment, given the complex situation in Middle East, as well as the fact that the Korean government wishes to be in good relations with the other Arab countries, including those that are against the direct dialogue between Egypt and Israel. </span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs9633BC1">The head of the Egyptian delegation, thanked for the support expressed by President Kim Il Sung, and gave assurances that the Egyptian government would give additional attention to its relations with the DPRK, with a view to developing and expanding these relations, to the benefit of both countries and peoples. </span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs9633BC1">As a friendly gesture towards the DPRK, the Egyptian government decided not to send (although it initially said it would) a sports delegation at the international shooting championship, which will begin on September 24</span><sup><span class="csCCECA60E">th</span></sup><span class="cs9633BC1"> in Seoul.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">Signed</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">Paul Marinescu</span></p></span>
