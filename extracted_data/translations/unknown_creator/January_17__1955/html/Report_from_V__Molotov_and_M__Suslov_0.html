There are cases among the population of displays of discontent at the existing situation which cannot be ignored, especially in view of the fact that it is necessary to achieve progress in the economic and cultural development of the DPRK which is convincing to all the Korean people (including South Korea). The situation in the Korean People&#39;s Army is bad. Military discipline has declined as a result of a slackening of political work in the Army and there is a lessening of political vigilance. There are cases of treason, desertion, and other crimes both among enlisted men and officers.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">The principles of collective leadership in the Worker&#39;s Party, Party democracy, criticism and self-criticism are being poorly implemented.

Consider it advisable to invite Cde. Kim Il Sung to Moscow in February 1955 with a group of senior Worker&#39;s Party CC officials instead of the previously planned time frame of April-May 1955, and hold a conversation with him in the CC Presidium.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">2.

High rates have also been adopted with respect to the production cooperation of agriculture. The Korean comrades are intent on putting all peasant farms into cooperatives in the next five or six years, which causes us serious concerns.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">The fact stands out that in the plans outlined and in the practical implementation of a number of measures the Korean comrades are insufficiently considering the need to carry out urgent measures to improve the population&#39;s living conditions which, according to available information, remain difficult. The Korean friends insufficiently take into account that in conditions where the country remains divided, it is especially important to show the entire Korean people, also including the population of South Korea, that in fact great work is being done in North Korea to improve the lives of the broad popular masses and in improving economic and cultural development at the same time. </span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">The CC of the Worker&#39;s Party devotes little attention to work in South Korea both legal and illegal, and does not have support there in existing legal organizations.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">In connection with the above it would be desirable to know the views of the CPC CC about the above issues and also about in what form the Chinese comrades could take part in the aforementioned consultations in Moscow.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Reports results by telegraph.</span></p></span>
