			<li class="cs8F481057"><span class="cs566403DE">Regarding the document above, Counselor Taeji Kim had met with Mr. Kelly, Deputy Director of Korean Affairs at the Department of States at 10 AM, September 4th. The details are outlined as follows:</span></li></ol>
		<ol style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

				<li class="csFE28A714"><span class="cs566403DE">Counselor Kim had mentioned </span><span class="csA0E9A871">U.S. Travel Restrictions to North Korea</span><span class="cs566403DE">. While we assume that the U.S. is reviewing the extension of such measure as it expires this September 13th, we strongly believe the restriction must not be lifted because the circumstances have not changed at all, and the North Korean puppet state has rather intensified its provocative attitude. He requested the U.S. to sufficiently consider this Korean viewpoint.</span></li></ol>

		<ol style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<ol style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
				<li class="csFE28A714"><span class="cs566403DE">Regarding the above, Kelly stated that he was advised on the expiration of the measure and that the U.S. is at this stage reviewing the matter. Although it is difficult to state anything before the review is finished, some news articles are discussing improvements in the relationship with Cuba lately, and people in charge of Cuban affairs believe they should consider eliminating the travel restrictions to Cuba. </span><span class="csA0E9A871">In this case, the U.S. cannot take exclusive action on Cuba because it will stand out. Thus, it is likely that people will argue for taking actions regarding North Korea and the Vietnams altogether.</span></li></ol>

			<ol style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
				<li class="csFE28A714"><span class="cs566403DE">In response, Counselor Kim had emphasized again that, although Korea is not in a position to become engaged in the issues regarding Cuba, we strongly believe travel restriction to North Korea must not be removed. He repeatedly requested that the U.S. bears</span><span class="cs566403DE"> this fact</span><span class="cs566403DE"> in mind when reviewing the travel restriction issue. Kelly responded that he will take care of it and mentioned that he will update us on the progress. </span></li></ol>

Counselor Kim is scheduled to meet with him tomorrow (September 6th) regarding this matter. [&hellip;]</span></li></ol>
