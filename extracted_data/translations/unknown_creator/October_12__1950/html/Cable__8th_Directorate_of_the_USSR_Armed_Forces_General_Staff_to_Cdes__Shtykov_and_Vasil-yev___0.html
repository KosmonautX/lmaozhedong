To immediately begin the evacuation of Pyongyang and other very important locations without any sort of panic;</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">2. The Korean people&#39;s forces are to make a fighting retreat to the north, delaying the enemy, and not letting him quickly branch out to the north;</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">3. Concentrate part of the troops in the mountainous regions north of Wonsan and Pyongyang, forming a strong defense there, and send the other part into the rear of the enemy in small detachments for partisan warfare [</span><span class="csC98BA9AD">delo</span><span class="cs566403DE">];</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">4. Send the mobilized Koreans to form new reserve divisions across the Chinese border to Manchuria in small groups and form divisions from them there (the Chinese comrades have agreed to this);</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">5. Send the transports that arrived with the Soviet weapons which have still not been used by the Korean comrades into the service of the Korean divisions being formed in Manchuria;</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">6. Put all Koreans studying in the USSR into aeronautics and organize air units from them which will get aircraft from the USSR;</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">7.
