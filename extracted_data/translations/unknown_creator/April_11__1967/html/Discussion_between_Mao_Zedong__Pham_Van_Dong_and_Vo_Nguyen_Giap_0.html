class="csF02181B3"><span class="cs566403DE">Pham Van Dong: We are very glad to see you healthy, Chairman Mao.</span></p><p class="csF02181B3"><span class="cs566403DE">Mao Zedong: Just normal, not very well&hellip;Among all of you here, is there anyone from the South?</span></p><p class="csF02181B3"><span class="cs566403DE">Vo Nguyen Giap: Comrade Pham Van Dong is a Southerner.</span></p><p class="csF02181B3"><span class="cs566403DE">Pham Van Dong: My native village is in Quang Ngai province [in central Vietnam], where people are fighting the enemy very well.</span></p><p class="csF02181B3"><span class="cs566403DE">Vo Nguyen Giap: Only in one year, people in Quang Ngai shot down almost 100 helicopters. &nbsp;They are fighting the puppet troops, [and] American and South Korean troops very well.</span></p><p class="csF02181B3"><span class="cs566403DE">Mao Zedong: As you are fighting, you have drawn experience, you have come to understand the rule. &nbsp;If you are not fighting you will not have experience, will not know the rule... &nbsp;It looks more or less similar to your resistance against the French.</span></p><p class="csF02181B3"><span class="cs566403DE">Pham Van Dong: We are now better than that and the fighting now is fiercer.</span></p><p class="csF02181B3"><span class="cs566403DE">Mao Zedong: So, I said you now know the rule.</span></p><p class="csF02181B3"><span class="cs566403DE">Pham Van Dong: We just began to do so.</span></p><p class="csF02181B3"><span class="cs566403DE">Mao Zedong: It is a matter of course that in the process, changes can occur. &nbsp;The most difficult years were from 1956 to 1959&hellip;In 1960 there were some good changes. &nbsp;From 1960 to 1961, the armed forces were still small. &nbsp;But in 1963 and 1964, the situation changed. &nbsp;And now, in 1965 and 1966, you have better understanding of the rule, based on your experiences fighting against French, Japanese, and now American troops. &nbsp;You also fought the Japanese, didn&rsquo;t you?</span></p><p class="csF02181B3"><span class="cs566403DE">Vo Nguyen Giap: Yes, we did, but not much; only in a small scale guerrilla warfare. &nbsp;In our fighting against the Americans, we always remember your words: try to preserve and develop our forces, steadfastly advancing forward.</span></p><p class="csF02181B3"><span class="cs566403DE">Mao Zedong: We have a saying: &ldquo;if you preserve the mountain green, you will never have to worry about firewood.&rdquo; &nbsp;The US is afraid of your tactics. &nbsp;They wish that you would order your regular forces to fight, so they can destroy your main forces. &nbsp;But you were not deceived. &nbsp;Fighting a war of attrition is like having meals: [it is best] not to have too big a bite. &nbsp;In fighting the US troops, you can have a bite the size of a platoon, a company, or a battalion. &nbsp;With regard to troops of the puppet regime, you can have a regiment-size bite. &nbsp;It means that fighting is similar to having meals, you should have one bite after another. &nbsp;After all, fighting is not too difficult an undertaking. &nbsp;The way of conducting it is just similar to the way you eat.</span></p><p class="csF02181B3"><span class="cs566403DE">&hellip;I was told that you wanted to build a new 100 km railway, do our Chinese counterparts agree to help you?</span></p><p class="csF02181B3"><span class="cs566403DE">Zhou Enlai: We have had discussions on the issue. &nbsp;Some people will be sent [to Vietnam] to make a feasibility study.</span></p><p class="csF02181B3"><span class="cs566403DE">Mao Zedong: It is not too long, shorter than the distance from Beijing to Tianjin.</span></p><p class="csF02181B3"><span class="cs566403DE">Pham Van Dong: We will make the feasibility study together with Chinese comrades.</span></p><p class="csF02181B3"><span class="cs566403DE">Mao Zedong: It&rsquo;s all right, for the sake of war. &nbsp;What about the matter of food supply?</span></p><p class="csF02181B3"><span class="cs566403DE">Zhou Enlai: We discussed this with Comrade Li Xiannian.</span><span class="cs566403DE"><a href="#_ftn0"><a name="_ftn_GoBack0"><sup><span class="cs3C248B7">[1]</span></sup></a></a></span><span class="cs566403DE"> &nbsp;We will provide 100 thousand tons of rice, 50 thousand tons of maize.</span></p><p class="csF02181B3"><span class="cs566403DE">Pham Van Dong: So, this year alone, China helped Vietnam with approximately 500 thousand tons of food. &nbsp;This help is very great.</span></p><p class="csF02181B3"><span class="cs566403DE">Mao Zedong: We can help you. &nbsp;Last year we had good crops.</span></p><p class="csF02181B3"><span class="cs566403DE">Pham Van Dong: Thank you, Chairman Mao.</span></p><p class="csF02181B3"><span class="cs566403DE">Mao Zedong: If you want to say thanks, you should say it to our peasants&hellip;Later, when you have dinner with Comrade Zhou, you can ask Comrade Wei Guoqing how he was criticized by the Red Guards. &nbsp;I know comrade Wei because he often visits and reports to me when he comes back from working visits to Vietnam. &nbsp;Who is now the new [Vietnamese] ambassador?</span></p><p class="csF02181B3"><span class="cs566403DE">Zhou Enlai: Comrade Ngo Minh Loan.</span><span class="cs566403DE"><a

[Loan]?</span></p><p class="csF02181B3"><span class="cs566403DE">Zhu Qiwen: Phoenix-like.</span></p><p class="csF02181B3"><span class="cs566403DE">Mao Zedong: This kind of bird is very strong.</span></p><p class="csF02181B3"><span class="cs566403DE">Pham Van Dong: Comrade Loan will try his best to continue the job by Comrade Tran Tu Binh,</span><span class="cs566403DE"><a href="#_ftn2"><a name="_ftn_GoBack2"><sup><span class="cs3C248B7">[3]</span></sup></a></a></span><span class="cs566403DE"> that is, to strengthen the friendship between the two countries.</span></p><p class="csF02181B3"><span class="cs566403DE">Mao Zedong: I am sorry that Comrade Tran Tu Binh passed away.</span></p><p class="csF02181B3"><span class="cs566403DE">Pham Van Dong: We are also very sad about it.</span></p><p class="csF02181B3"><span class="cs566403DE">Mao Zedong: What kind of illness did he have?</span></p><p class="csF02181B3"><span class="cs566403DE">Pham Van Dong: The same illness he had before and after he came back home, he was too busy.</span></p><p class="csF02181B3"><span class="cs566403DE">Vo Nguyen Giap: He passed away after having a serious cold. &nbsp;He was in the same hospital with ambassador Zhou Qiyun.</span></p><p class="csF02181B3"><span class="cs566403DE">Zhu Qiwen: The Friendship Hospital. &nbsp;I also have a record of high blood pressure.</span></p><p class="csF02181B3"><span class="cs566403DE">Pham Van Dong: Today, we would like to pay a courtesy visit to you, Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin [Biao] and other comrades. &nbsp;Once again, thank you very much. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF02181B3"><span class="cs566403DE">....</span></p><p class="csF02181B3"><span class="cs566403DE">Mao Zedong: You have been bravely struggling both in the North and in the South.</span></p><p class="csF02181B3"><span class="cs566403DE">Pham Van Dong: It&rsquo;s because we are learning Chairman Mao&rsquo;s military thinking.</span></p><p class="csF02181B3"><span class="cs566403DE">Mao Zedong: [It is] not necessary. &nbsp;Without it, you still can gain victory. &nbsp;In the past, you were fighting the Japanese, the French. &nbsp;Now you are fighting the Americans.</span></p><p class="csF02181B3"><span class="cs566403DE">Pham Van Dong: Thanks to the military policy of our Party and also to Mao Zedong&rsquo;s military thinking.</span></p><p class="csF02181B3"><span class="cs566403DE">....</span></p><p class="csF02181B3"><span class="cs566403DE">Vo Nguyen Giap: &nbsp;As I remember, at one time during our resistance war against the French, Comrade Zhou sent president Ho a telegram that read: &ldquo;Now is not the right time to have a peaceful solution. &nbsp;You should continue fighting.&rdquo; &nbsp;[Ed. note: Giap refers to late 1949 or January 1950.]</span></p><p class="csF02181B3"><span class="cs566403DE">Zhou Enlai: At that time, the French were going to recognize us. &nbsp;But because we recognized Vietnam they ignored us. &nbsp;As Lenin taught, big countries have the responsibility to encourage the world revolution. &nbsp;At that time revolution was victorious in Russia, so Lenin thought of China and India. &nbsp;Now, Lenin&rsquo;s desire has been half-realized: the Chinese revolution has been successful. &nbsp;Yet, reality has not developed the way people want it to be. &nbsp;Some smaller countries gained victory earlier. &nbsp;Victory in Korea is followed by the one in Vietnam.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><sup></sup><a href="#_ftn_GoBack0"><a
