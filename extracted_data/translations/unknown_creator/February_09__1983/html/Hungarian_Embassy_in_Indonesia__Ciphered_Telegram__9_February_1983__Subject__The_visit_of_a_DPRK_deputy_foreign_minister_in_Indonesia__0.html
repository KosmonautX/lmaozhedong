		<span><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">At the airport, before the arrival of Polish Deputy Foreign Minister [Tadeusz] Olechowski, General Director of &nbsp;Political Affairs Munawir told us the following about the discussions held in the course of DPRK Deputy Foreign Minister Kim&rsquo;s [</span><span class="csC98BA9AD">sic</span><span class="cs566403DE">] working visit in Indonesia (February 3-5</span><sup><span class="cs6D6FB01F">th</span></sup><span class="cs566403DE">): &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">North Korea asked for Indonesia&rsquo;s support with regard to two issues:</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">The issue of Korean reunification be placed on the agenda of the summit [of the Non-Aligned Movement] in New Delhi, and this subject be included in the final statement (political declaration) in accordance with the North Korean approach.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">The next summit of the non-aligned countries be held in Pyongyang.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">To the first issue, [the Indonesians] replied that this problem was a domestic affair of the two Koreas, and they should solve it through negotiations. Munawir added that the fulfillment of this request would be difficult anyway, because the Korean question was deleted from the agenda of the first summit.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">On the second issue, they evaded making a standpoint by saying that if the right to organize the next summit was also given to an Asian country, then it would be unfair to deny Iraq, which had already made great financial sacrifices to arrange the present summit, this opportunity. </span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">The aforesaid result of the visit is remarkable, all the more so because one purpose of Kim&rsquo;s visit was to make preparations for Vice-President [Adam] Malik&rsquo;s trip to Pyongyang, which started on February 7</span><sup><span class="cs6D6FB01F">th</span></sup><span class="cs566403DE">. Taking the close Indonesian-South Korean cooperation into consideration, it cannot be expected that Indonesia will make concessions to the DPRK at the expense of South Korea. Therefore, Malik&rsquo;s visit is regarded as a goodwill visit, rather than [a political one]. Still, the Soviet ambassador does not exclude the possibility that during the visit, Indonesian-Chinese contacts might be made in Pyongyang. Malik has the reputation of being a firm advocate of the normalization of Indonesian-Chinese relations.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">19 &ndash; D.</span></p></span>
