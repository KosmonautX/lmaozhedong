Thanking for the message, the Spanish ambassador replied that the request would be forwarded to his home country. The problem is not simple, he said, because Spain maintains diplomatic relations with South Korea. The request could still be examined and the experience of the countries that maintain diplomatic relations with both South Korea and North Korea will be considered.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">During a casual meeting, I informed the ambassador of the Democratic People&rsquo;s Republic of Korea about the results.
