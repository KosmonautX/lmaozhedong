Their demands are limited to insisting on the withdrawal of foreign troops. They do not consider it necessary to emphasize that the USA should cease supporting the South Korean regime.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">The Vietnamese comrades perceive a [potential] danger in Nixon&rsquo;s policy, namely, that the USA might withdraw its ground troops from South Vietnam, and then urges the [North and South] Vietnamese to negotiate with each other. This is why the Vietnamese comrades demand, as their second precondition in addition to the withdrawal of the [US] army, that the USA should cease supporting the Saigon regime. Neither the Chinese nor the Koreans stress the second demand, and this worries the Vietnamese comrades.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">[...] &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">&ndash; 16 &ndash; Pint&eacute;r &ndash;</span></p></span>
