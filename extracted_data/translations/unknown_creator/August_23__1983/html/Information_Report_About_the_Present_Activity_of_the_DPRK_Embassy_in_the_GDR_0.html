Within the limits of the hitherto conducted and supervised operation on the DPRK Embassy in the GDR, the following generalized operational statements about the functioning of the Embassy can be made:</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">2.1. Contact-related work of the Korean Embassy</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">2.1.1.

whereupon they frequently contact the Embassy.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">For other persons contacted, their stays in the 60s, carried out for the purpose of completing a common economic project between the GDR and the DPRK in Hamhŭng, form the basis of contacts with [NAME REDACTED] and [NAME REDACTED], especially since [NAME REDACTED] back then was appointed to the supervision of GDR specialists in Hamhŭng. &nbsp;Still existing sponsorship-relations with institutions or establishments carrying the name &ldquo;Kim Il Sung&rdquo; are also a basis of contact.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">It is to be noted that [NAME REDACTED] and [NAME REDACTED] sporadically engage in contact activities and primarily use them to request from their contact partners that congratulatory cards (i.e., laudatory articles) and congratulatory telegrams be sent to official Korean posts on the occasion of particular highlights in the DPRK, such as </span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">- the birthday of Kim Il Sung</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">- the birthday of Kim Jong Il</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">- the anniversary of the founding of the WPK,</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">for which the contact partners, in part, are specifically sought out.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">The chief concern of their contact activity is the popularization and propagandization of the accomplishments of the DPRK, with particular attention being dedicated to the portrayal of Kim Il Sung as the founder of the </span><span class="csC98BA9AD">chuch&rsquo;e</span><span class="cs566403DE"> ideology. </span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Through the predominant propagandization of Korean politics vis-&agrave;-vis their contact partners, [NAME REDACTED] and [NAME REDACTED] endeavor to develop concordant opinions, in order to portray the growing interest for Korean developments among the GDR population as an achievement of the work of the DPRK embassy.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Besides the already mentioned avenues for the attainment of this goal, both diplomats use their contacts for the wide circulation of Korean propaganda material. &nbsp;Furthermore, a selection of contact partners with sufficient language proficiency are commissioned for the short-term translation of various materials.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">It is interesting that [NAME REDACTED] and [NAME REDACTED] show a general interest in the career development, family situation, hobby, and recreational activities of their contact partners, yet both diplomats survey their contact partners only superficially and not comprehensively in accordance with the real volume of information. &nbsp;Instead, they broach questions about the development of the GDR and the socialist community of states only in relation to Korean happenings, in order to evidence the correctness of the </span><span class="csC98BA9AD">chuch&rsquo;e</span><span class="cs566403DE"> ideology.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">In accordance with the Korean ideology, [NAME REDACTED] and [NAME REDACTED] also do not seek a discussion about global political problems.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Next to the contacts with GDR citizens, [NAME REDACTED] and [NAME REDACTED] are tasked with the supervision of Korean citizens staying in the GDR for the purposes of education and work.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Due to the organizational principles of the Korean Embassy, the students are directly, i.e., through someone who is responsible for them, in weekly contact with the Embassy. &nbsp;Instruction in the study of the teachings of Kim Il Sung as well as a general reporting on task fulfillment occurs during this contact.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">In consequence of the cooperative bases (direct agreements, party relations WPK/SED, cultural-exchange plan), the Korean citizens enjoy &ldquo;freedoms&rdquo; beyond the concrete educational objective, which make it possible to gain comprehensive insight into the respective educational areas.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">2.1.2. Receptions and official contacts of the Embassy on the occasion of social highlights of the DPRK:</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">- birthday of Kim Il Sung &ndash; 4/15</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">- birthday of Kim Jong Il &ndash;

of the Korean Embassy, Ri Dong Il, fulfills the duties that are within the framework of his diplomatic activity, and, in front of official representatives from the MfNV</span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftn_GoBack2"><sup><span class="cs6D6FB01F">[3]</span></sup></a><span class="cs566403DE">, he displays efforts to further develop the relations between the Korean People&rsquo;s Army and the NPA</span><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftn_GoBack3"><sup><span class="cs6D6FB01F">[4]</span></sup></a><span class="cs566403DE"> of the GDR.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">The deputy to Ri Dong Il is [NAME REDACTED], who, besides his diplomatic activity, is also active for the Korean foreign trade company &ldquo;Moran&rdquo; (procurement for the Korean Ministry of Defense), for which he maintains contacts to specific foreign trade companies in the GDR.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">In this connection, one should note the existence of a group of Korean diplomats within the Embassy who are protected by their diplomatic activities and, according to the intelligence of Department X, carry out specific tasks&mdash;by order of the WPK&mdash;with regard to South Koreans living in Western Europe.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">It can be assessed that through the multi-layered official contacts of the Korean Embassy extensive opportunities for information gathering on economic and political questions become available, and thus the Embassy&rsquo;s utilization of individual GDR contact partners&rsquo; volume of information (unofficial informant, the Embassy&rsquo;s circle of friends) is not totally necessary, especially since they are only superficially and primarily made familiar with Korean politics.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">2.1.3. Distribution of materials</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Another form of the Korean Embassy&rsquo;s activity is the extensive sending of materials to a wide-ranging group of people (approx. 250 per month). &nbsp;Included in this distribution are a wide variety of current materials or speeches of DPRK representatives as well as daily newspapers and periodicals.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">The bases of the distribution of materials are</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">- personal and private contacts with the Embassy;</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">- commercial contacts with the Embassy;</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">- scientific, i.e., professional, interest in the DPRK;</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">- addresses of people who used to live in the DPRK for personal reasons, with the Korean Embassy receiving the addresses from the Korean travel agency (DPRK travel agency R.J.T.B.
