On the basis of the agreement that Pham Van Dong signed last year, they receive construction materials, medical drugs, chemical fertilizer, and iron products. What causes problems is that the DPRK fulfilled barely 60 percent of the shipment obligations it undertook in 1973.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">8 &ndash; K. </span></p></span>
