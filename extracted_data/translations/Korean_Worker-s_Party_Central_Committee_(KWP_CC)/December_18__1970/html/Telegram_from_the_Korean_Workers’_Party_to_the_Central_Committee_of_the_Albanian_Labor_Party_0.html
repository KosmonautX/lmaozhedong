We are happy to see that the brotherly relations of friendship and cooperation now existing between our two parties are going on very well, and we are convinced that these relations will be strengthened and furthered even more in the future on the basis of the principles of Marxism-Leninism and of the proletarian internationalism in our common struggle against the imperialism, with the United States imperialism at its helm, to the defense of socialism and communism. We sincerely wish to your people new successes in their struggle for the construction of socialism and the progress of the country. </span></p><p class="cs7C1F8B9D"><span class="cs566403DE">THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF </span></p><p class="cs7C1F8B9D"><span class="cs566403DE">THE KOREAN WORKERS&rsquo; PARTY </span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Pyongyang, on December 18, 1970</span><span class="cs8B35A763"> </span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE"><br><br></span></p></span>
