Throughout the discussion the issue of Korean reunification was tackled, in the light of the Joint Communiqu&eacute; of the North and South in July 1972, as well as of the agreement to establish the SNCC [South-North Coordinating Committee] since the autumn of last year.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">I am taking note of the following facts conveyed by our interlocutor:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Despite the SNCC having decided upon a series of specific measures in the framework of North-South collaboration in the economic, political, cultural and defense fields that are meant to bring about unification, the authorities in Seoul have made declarations against any type of collaboration, going as far as affirming that the issue of reunification should be brought up again 10 years from now.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">A series of specific facts prove that the South Korean authorities do not wish to take serious measures towards reunification. Recently, the DPRK has suggested a delivery of raw materials to certain factories in the South in order to prevent expensive imports from India. Though the offer was extremely favorable for the South, it was rejected.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">According to the opinion of the DPRK, the independent and peaceful reunification of the country will not be possible until U.S. troops leave the South&mdash;a fact which would create the necessary conditions for organizing free elections on democratic foundations. In the course of the legitimate struggle of the Korean people for reunification, the revolutionary strengthening of the North has particular significance.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">As far as the U.N. is concerned, it could make a significant contribution if it decides on withdrawing the so-called &ldquo;U.N. forces,&rdquo; which have been occupying the South for more than 20 years, as well as on dissolving the UNCURK [UN Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea].</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Kim Chan-seok described the position of Turkey as hostile, though Turkish diplomats have noted that the aggression in 1950 was decided upon by [Prime Minister Adnan] Menderes without parliamentary approval.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Kim Chan-seok showed significant interest for the political situation in Turkey and showed interest for both official and informal contacts with representatives of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs as well as with those of other ministries.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">At their request of assisting them with this issue, we replied we have no possibility since the central administration is found in Ankara.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Also, we have been asked to distribute PR materials for the DPRK. We expressed our regret in not being able to, due to a Turkish law which forbids the dissemination of such materials, unless they describe our own country.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0" style="tab-stops:left 120pt;"><span class="cs5EFED22F">	</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Signed: Ilie Tudor</span></p></span>
