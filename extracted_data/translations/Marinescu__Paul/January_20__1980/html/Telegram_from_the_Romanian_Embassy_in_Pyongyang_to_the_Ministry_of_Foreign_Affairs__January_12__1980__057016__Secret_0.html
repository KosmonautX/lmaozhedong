		<span><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs5EFED22F">To Comrade Constantin Oancea, Deputy Minister,</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs5EFED22F">From the discussions with comrade Pak Seong-cheol [Pak Song Chol] regarding the internal situation, resulted the following:</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs5EFED22F">1. In 1979, the Democratic People&#39;s Republic of Korea had good results in both industry and agriculture, having produced 9 million tons of cereal, the largest harvest in the history of the country.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The main concern in 1980 will be reaching the goals set by the economic plan before October, when the 6th Congress of the Workers&rsquo; Party of Korea will take place.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs5EFED22F">During the meetings of the 6th Congress of the Workers Party of Korea a serious analysis of what has been realized so far is foreseen. An activity plan for the future will be established based on the positive experience and the conclusions that can be drawn.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs5EFED22F">2. Regarding the current situation in South Korea, comrade Pak Seong-cheol said that the situation is very complicated and confusing, especially after the death of Park Chung Hee. A fight for power between different factions has been noticed and continues to persist in the framework of the new leadership.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The actions taken on the forefront for the democratization of the South Korean Society, including the abrogation of the martial law, are insignificant as the repressive movements continue even without this law.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The masses applied a lot of pressure on the new authorities for the modification of the constitution and for ensuring democratic rights and freedoms. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The new authorities can&#39;t ignore this situation and took measures in this respect, but they didn&#39;t change the essence of the old regime too much. For now, it can be stated that a regime of the same type as the one from the time of Park Chung Hee has been established in South Korea, but without Park Chung Hee.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs5EFED22F">However, the DRPK hasn&#39;t abandoned the idea of restarting the dialogue with the South; this dialogue will create the necessary conditions for the reunification of the country. Because of this [desire to resume talks with the South], a proposal to form a joint team to participate in the Olympic Games in Moscow was sent [to Seoul], but the South Korean side hasn&#39;t replied so far.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs5EFED22F">We observe the restraint of the leadership of the Democratic People&#39;s Republic of Korea from publicly criticizing the new South Korean authorities.</span></p><p class="csA300C48E"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Signed, </span></p><p class="csA300C48E"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Paul Marinescu.</span></p></span>
