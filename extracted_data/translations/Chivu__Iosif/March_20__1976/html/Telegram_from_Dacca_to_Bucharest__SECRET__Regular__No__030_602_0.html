In these conditions, the Democratic People&#39;s Republic of Korea is trying to find someone to resort to in case of emergency. From amongst the two big socialist countries, not that much aid is expected from China, which keeps changing its attitude towards the Korean matter according to its own interests in its relations with the United States. The death of Zhou Enlai intensified the oscillatory position of China and even if Mao Zedong would like to adopt a position that would be more favorable to North Korea, he no longer has the necessary power to do so.</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The North Korean diplomats insinuated that [they] could have much more faith in the USSR.</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="cs5EFED22F">(This conversation occurred between the North Korean diplomats and Valeriu Simion, second secretary).</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Signed: Ambassador Iosif Chivu</span></p></span>
