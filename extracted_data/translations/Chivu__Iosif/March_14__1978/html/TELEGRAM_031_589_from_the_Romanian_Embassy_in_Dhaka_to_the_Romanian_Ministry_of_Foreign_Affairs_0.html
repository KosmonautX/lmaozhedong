Moreover the Bangladeshi government does not consider the presence of the American forces in South Korea to be normal. </span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">The Korean Vice-President renewed his invitation for President Rahman Ziaur to visit Korea &ndash; an invitation previously made by President Kim Il Sung. </span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">If in the past Rahman Ziaur only accepted the invitation in general terms, this time he said &ldquo;inform President Kim Il Sung that I will arrive in Democratic People&rsquo;s Republic of Korea on October 1</span><sup><span class="cs6D6FB01F">st</span></sup><span class="cs566403DE">&rdquo;. The date is not publicly available yet. </span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">The North Koreans were simply amazed by this change in attitude in favor of North Korea, but it sees it with a bit of reserve, as it expects reactions from South Korea and the United States vis-&agrave;-vis Bangladesh.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">The Korean diplomat showed that several socialist countries in Europe, which he did not name but hinted at all of them except for Yugoslavia and Romania, shared an unfavorable view of the visit of the Vice President of North Korea and its outcome. Diplomats of the respective socialist countries said that the North Koreans should have waited for the European socialist countries to make contact with the government of Bangladesh before having engaged in such high-level contacts.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">We believe that the attitude of the Bangladeshi government towards the resolution of the Korean question is not a change of position in its foreign policy which is generally pro-Western, but rather a circumstantial position determined by the actual political in-fighting in Bangladesh. The current Bangladeshi government is trying to prove that it adopts constructive positions on international problems and seeks to improve its relations with as many states as possible, including with socialist countries.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">Signed</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Iosif Chivu</span></p></span>
