The North Korean Ambassador has received instructions from home concerning his future actions at the UN. I however believe they will act towards rejecting and revealing US maneuvers.</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The only means of settling the dispute is via bilateral negotiations between North Korea and the US on the one hand, as well as between North and South Korea, on the other, in view of signing the peace treaty.</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Such a solution would allow North Korea to decide the deadline of US withdrawal from the Korean territory, in order to make way for a real territorial reunification.</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The North Korean diplomat appeared dissatisfied by the passive attitude of the Soviet diplomats displayed in talks he had with them about the US letter. They avoided formulating their own opinions on the new US position in the Korean context.</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Signed: Ion Datcu</span></p></span>
