It is possible that the US, as a result of an implied understanding, will take measures towards de facto dissolving the UN headquarters.</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="cs5EFED22F">In such circumstances, the General Assembly or the Security Council shall solely take note of the UN headquarters [in Korea] dismantling, similar to 1973, when the UN Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea was dissolved. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Signed: Ion Datcu</span></p></span>
