Kim Il Sung himself is not obligated as Prime Minister to personally sign the armistice. The solution of the issue of who will sign the armistice for the Chinese-Korean side belongs entirely and completely to the governments of the DPRK and PRC and should not by any means be dependent on pressure from the Americans, etc.</span></p><p class="csF747CCFF"><span class="cs566403DE">In present conditions a trip by Kim Il Sung to Panmunjom is fraught with a certain risk in view of the behavior of the South Koreans, who might resort to some sort of provocation against Cde. Kim Il Sung. The interests of the matter require precluding the slightest possibility of such a provocation from the South Koreans and this might be ensured by Kim Il Sung not personally taking part in the signing of the armistice at Panmunjom. On this issue the CPSU CC does not advise yielding to any other considerations since these considerations are of secondary importance in this situation. But, of course, Kim Il Sung&#39;s refusal to go to Panmunjom need not be ostentatious. And what is more, just because Kim Il Sung will not go to Panmunjom it is extremely important that Cde. Peng Dehuai be in Panmunjom to personally sign the armistice together with a deputy prime minister of the DPRK.</span></p><p class="csC3FDFDC4"><span class="cs566403DE">The CPSU CC does not think that the Americans will manage to use the failure of Kim Il Sung to go to Panmunjom in any way to postpone the signing of the agreement. The postponement of the signing of the agreement for such a reason would not receive the support of international public opinion.</span></p><p class="csA041CEA8"><span class="cs566403DE">We think that there is no need to fear an unfavorable impression on the Korean and Chinese peoples if Kim Il Sung does not personally sign the armistice agreement. We have no doubt that the Korean and Chinese friends will be able to properly explain the situation if there is a need for this.</span></p><p class="csBCA1AF02"><span class="cs566403DE">These are the considerations to which the CPSU CC would like to direct the attention of the Korean and Chinese friends. We hope that these considerations will be taken into consideration.</span></p><p class="csB60FD7E3"><span class="cs566403DE">Inform Kim Il Sung and the Korean friends that we are sending the considerations mentioned above to [Beijing] at the same time to be passed to Cde. Mao Zedong and the Chinese friends.</span></p><p class="cs7456802A"><span class="cs566403DE">Telegraph when this is done.</span></p></span>
