This is a significantly more difficult moment by comparison with 1972, when the political dispersal and disorganization in the South made it easier for the DPRK to apply its own unification view.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">At the same time, diplomats from both parts have become more active in securing international support for their own position in the peninsula.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">From the many actions launched abroad by the DPRK and South Korea in mid-February, we view as particularly significant the beginning of the Sino-American dialogue concerning U.S. troop withdrawals from Korea.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">We consider that the main objective of the visit to Peking of the Minister for Foreign Affairs Heo Dam [Ho Tam] was supporting the Chinese initiative in conversations with H. Kissinger for withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea. The presence in Washington of South Korean Minister of Foreign Relations, Kim Yong-sik, was aimed at obtaining guarantees that the gradual withdrawal of American troops will happen only if the U. S. modernizes the South Korean army, according to the five-year-plan of economic and military assistance.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">At the same time, visits of the DPRK&rsquo;s party, government and parliamentary delegations are taking place in over 30 countries around the world. They have a mandate to express opinions concerning the reunification, to obtain support for it and to push for the isolation of South Korea to such an extent that &ldquo;the latter will have to accept the proposals and line imposed by the North.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">The DPRK is facing difficulties in this activity: simultaneous measures from Seoul; the visit of Kim Yong-sik to Japan, to the Federal Republic of Germany, to the UK, to the U.N., as well as other international contacts, including socialist countries.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Following the analysis of power balance in the peninsula and in order to maintain dialogue and ensure progress, we recommend a gradual approach to all issues, starting from common points of view which would allow for tackling more complex fields, including the political one.</span></p><p class="cs2D0A5422"><span class="cs566403DE">Signed: Aurelian Lazar</span></p></span>
