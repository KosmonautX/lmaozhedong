Yet again, the North Koreans put forward:</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs8F481057"><span class="cs566403DE">The 5-point plan released at the previous meeting;</span></li><li class="cs8F481057"><span class="cs566403DE">The idea of summoning political consultations between parties, civil societies, high-profile personalities in various fields, from both North and South [Korea];</span></li><li class="cs8F481057"><span class="cs566403DE">The idea of creating 5 bilateral cooperation commissions.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Thinking that the core military and political issues can be solved, the South said it was ready to form and launch the economic and socio-cultural cooperation commissions, arguing that they can guarantee the framework for the gradual resolution of fundamental problems, based on the gradual restoration of mutual trust.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">On the basis of the same economic and socio-cultural matters, the South put forward the idea of a &lsquo;mutual general opening&rsquo; which, although embraced in principle by the North, bore no fruit because of Pyongyang&rsquo;s insistence that all fields, including political, military, diplomatic issues, be included.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">After the press conference of the North Korean co-president of the Coordinating Committee, Vice-Premier Pak Seong-cheol, that was held upon his return from Seoul, it could be gathered that the South criticized the North for enshrining the existence of two &lsquo;Koreas,&rsquo; by seeking membership in international organizations and by establishing diplomatic relations with states with which South Korea already has relations. </span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Without providing arguments to refute the accusations issued by the South, the Vice-Premier said that if the South Koreans do not wish to transform the country into &lsquo;two Koreas&rsquo; then they should immediately accept the proposal regarding the creation of the diplomatic commission for the coordination of joint actions on the international arena.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">After analyzing this new moment in North-South relations, we could confirm the previous conclusion of our office that the resolution of the Korean matter is increasingly heading on a path of direct channels between Seoul and Pyongyang, each camp using collateral solutions and the support given by external factors against the other Korean side.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Signed: Aurelian Lazar</span></p></span>
