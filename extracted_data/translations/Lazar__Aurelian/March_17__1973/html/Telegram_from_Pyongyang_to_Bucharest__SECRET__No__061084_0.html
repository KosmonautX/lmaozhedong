Representatives of Pyongyang refused to take in consideration the creation of only two subcommittees, insisting on the simultaneous creation of all five (political, military, diplomatic, economic and cultural) planned in the second session of co-presidents in November 1972. This proposal was not accepted by Lee Hu-rak.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Thus, due to the cautious attitude of the South and the &ldquo;all or nothing&rdquo; strategy of the north, the session ended without any notable success.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">At the press conference held on 16 March by Pyongyang-assigned co-president (to which press attaches of diplomatic missions were present), </span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Deputy Prime Minister Pak Seong-cheol [Pak Song Chol] criticized South Korean authorities for fragmenting the issue of reunification in &ldquo;simple&rdquo; and &ldquo;complex&rdquo; issues, as well as for introducing &ldquo;priorities&rdquo; and &ldquo;procedural sequences.&rdquo; Pak Seong-cheol underlined that the &ldquo;sincere wish towards reunification is sufficient for solving all problems, be they simple or complex, without any pre-established order and without preconceived procedures.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">After analyzing the proceedings of the recent session, the rigid position of the DPRK who rejected Southern proposals (which, though did not exhaust all available possibilities, offered nevertheless the framework for economic, cultural, sports, etc. types of exchanges and contacts), we consider that the visible change of stance from the past of the DPRK has a lot to do with the country&rsquo;s first victories resulting from synchronizing the inter-Korean dialogue with international developments (the opening of Sino-American dialogue regarding withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea).</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">It is obvious that the DPRK is attempting, with the help of P.R. China or by itself, to gain the time necessary for obtaining the disengagement of the U.S. from the peninsula, which in turn would ensure a position of superiority for Pyongyang in inter-Korean negotiations.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">At the same time, the DPRK is expecting practical results from the comprehensive international campaign to make contacts (visits to approximately 45 different countries) aimed also at undermining South Korea externally.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Encouraging existing trends of opinion at the international level concerning withdrawal of foreign troops from other territories, as well as increased demands of U.S. political personalities for withdrawal from South Korea and cessation of military help for Seoul, are of great interest to the DPRK.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">We therefore consider that the new DPRK tactic aims at achieving immediate objectives of unification without South Korea, even against it.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">The continuation of inter-Korean dialogue will therefore retain a formal character, depending mostly on indirect actions and various contingencies.</span></p><p class="cs2D0A5422"><span class="cs566403DE">Signed: Aurelian Lazar</span></p></span>
