In this respect, he said, at the secret meetings between the two co-presidents, Lee Hu-rak, the South Korean representative, said that South Korea would have been more receptive to the proposals of the North if the United States and Japan would not have exerted pressure on certain groups, especially on military groups in the South Korean governmental apparatus.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">There are several strands of thought developing in governmental circles in Seoul, and here Lee Hu-rak referred to the military trend as the most powerful one and the most hostile to unification, then to a centrist trend which is leaning towards contacts with the North (limited to economic and socio-cultural matters) and the opposition, comprising progressive and patriotic forces, which are keen on a rapid achievement of unification. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">An Jang-il described the situation in South Korea as unstable, which is why Seoul is trying to slow down the process of unification, formulating proposals to revise the agreements reached in July 1972 and the agreements which led to the creation of the South-North Coordinating Committee.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The [North Korean] interlocutor mentioned that the third session in Seoul ended without achieving any concrete results, that there are new and great difficulties ahead in the field of North-South contacts, and that the duration of the process of unification is much longer than initially envisaged.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Furthermore, An Jang-il said that currently South Korea launched an operation meant to enshrine the division of Korea by pushing towards the simultaneous accession of the two Koreas to the United Nations. &ldquo;We fear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that this South Korean plan will gain support from Third World countries, from those who do not know or who have a simplistic view of the solution for the Korean problem.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">An Jang-il said that the propaganda agencies in the DPRK would launch an operation to unmask the intentions of the South Koreans and to explain Pyongyang&rsquo;s position in light of comrade Kim Il Sung&rsquo;s statement dated 23 June. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Signed: Aurelian Lazar</span></p></span>
