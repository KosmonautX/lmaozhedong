From the comments of socialist diplomats as well as of other countries, partially confirmed by the insistence with which the Korean press is justifying the position of the DPRK government, it has become apparent that some members of the Korean leadership, militaries most of all, have not fully grasped the concession made in favor of U.S. troops stationing in South Korea, an issue which remained outside the final document adopted on 21 November.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">On the other hand, the realist spirit in which the U.N. has solved this issue is ignored in North-South relations. Polemics on various topics is intensifying. On the backdrop of political tensions on both sides, throughout the last days military elements have sprung, motivated by the repeated entry of DPRK ships in the territorial waters of islands recently claimed by the North (next to Haeju port in the Yellow Sea). This course of action, explained by DPRK as a means of exercising legitimate control in these territories, is seen by authorities in Seoul as the most serious incident since the &lsquo;Pueblo Case&rsquo; in 1968 which triggered a state of military alert from the part of South Korea, coupled with the threat that a future similar attempt would result in retaliation. </span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">In case DPRK aimed these actions at supporting student movements in South Korea, the result was the opposite, as the general mobilization of the army is on the verge of resulting in the forceful repression of youth movements. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">We note that conversely, the authorities in Seoul used this action to pass through parliament&mdash;without objections&mdash;the military budget for 1974.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Signed: Aurelian Lazar</span></p></span>
