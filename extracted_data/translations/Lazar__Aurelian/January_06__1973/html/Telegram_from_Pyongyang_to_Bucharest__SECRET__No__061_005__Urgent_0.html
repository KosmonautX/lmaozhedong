In this respect, all production sectors had to fulfill their quotas planned for 1973 by the end of 1972, which was impossible except for some large industrial machinery-building factories and for some chemical plants. Some of these fulfilled the quotas planned for 1975. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">In the first two years of the six-year plan, the production quotas were not met, and there is a significant lag between various economic sectors. This leads to stagnation in terms of the quantity and quality of goods set aside for exports. These phenomena are largely caused by the significant amounts of money spent on consolidating national defense, which leads to scarce work-force.</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

		<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">These structural modifications acquire a special meaning given the long-term agreement signed with Japan at the beginning of 1972, amounting to approximately $2 billion. Given that the DPRK does not release official data concerning foreign trade or any other economic sectors, our estimates are based on the information gathered from the economic sections of socialist countries, present in Pyongyang and on foreign publications.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Given these circumstances, it appears that the DPRK&rsquo;s foreign trade volume in 1972, according to the commercial protocols and contracts signed with its partners to the &lsquo;West,&rsquo; amounted to 1 billion rubles, out of which 600 million with socialist countries, and approximately 450 million rubles with capitalist and developing countries. We cannot make any statements with respect to the fulfillment of the plan but it is clear that North Korean export quotas to socialist countries, which according to the commercial agreements signed amounts to 330 million rubles, were only 70-72 percent fulfilled. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Given our observations from last year, we can draw certain conclusions about these phenomena, which carry on from year to year:</span></p><ul start="1975" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csF1174AD5" value="1975"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The availability of competitive export goods is inferior to the responsibilities assumed every year through commercial protocols;</span></li><li class="csF1174AD5"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The quality of goods and packaging has not improved;</span></li><li class="csF1174AD5"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Prices are extremely inflated compared to similar goods (which are produced with better technical means);</span></li><li class="csF1174AD5"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Quality benchmarks and delivery timetables specified in commercial contracts are not fully respected;</span></li><li class="csF1174AD5"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Penalties and complaints are not taken into account;</span></li><li class="csF1174AD5"><span class="cs5EFED22F">By the end of each year, goods which are not delivered on time are usually overlooked.</span></li></ul>

		<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">There are two broad categories of goods the North Koreans are interested in: goods produced by the machinery-building industry and chemical goods.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The main problem is the fact that the DPRK is facing serious problems in terms of its export capabilities, due to the diversification of its exchanges with other states, especially with Western countries: Japan, France, Federal Republic of Germany, United Kingdom etc. The array of high quality Korean goods has shrunk considerably. At the same time, the North Koreans are trying to improve their export capabilities, increasing the share of machinery and equipment to the detriment of raw materials. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Because the Heavy Machinery Industry Ministry and the Light Equipment Construction Industry Ministry are not interested in purchasing the quantities specified in the commercial protocol, the leadership of the DPRK Foreign Trade Ministry stopped signing contracts with us on the following categories of goods we export: heavy trucks, diesel and electrical locomotives, etc. etc.</span></p><ol start="4" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

		<ul start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csF1174AD5"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Most goods the DPRK produces have been included in our 1971-1975 trade protocol. Other important goods like cadmium, brass, iron-manganese, copper ore and concentrate, zinc, wolfram, etc. etc., are not available for export to Eastern countries (socialist). Some laminates containing copper, zinc, and lead, even when they are available, they are exaggeratedly highly priced for socialist countries. &nbsp;</span></li></ul>
		<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Given the raw materials existing in North Korea, we believe it useful to send a delegation of specialists from the Heavy Machinery Production Ministry to explore these resources.</span></p><ol start="5" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

		<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">For 1973, the DPRK will undertake efforts to develop key branches of the economy, prioritizing on certain objectives of higher importance, such as:</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csCBF31A94"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Vehicle and machinery-building: new types of tractors, extractive industry equipment, automated tools, trucks, with a view to reaching the following figures in 1-2 years: 30,000 tractors; 15,000-30,000 trucks and vans. Moreover, special attention will be given to the electronics industry and to the automation of modes of production.</span></li><li class="csCBF31A94"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Metallurgy: developing the production of various types of steel and laminates, non-ferrous metals, etc. The following steel mills will start producing: Kim Chaek (current capabilities will be expanded by 1,000,000 tons per year with the help of Japanese and Soviet technology); Songrim (with a capacity of 850,000 tons per year, producing tin, construction steel and large frames. The metallurgical plants in Hwanghae and Kangseon will be expanded, where recently discovered iron ore in the Anju-area will be exploited (approximately 10 billion tons). </span></li><li class="csCBF31A94"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Chemistry. Two refineries will be built over the course of this year: at Unggi (with a capacity of 1.5 million tons per year, to be built by the Soviet Union) and Namheung (to be built by the People&rsquo;s Republic of China). Crude oil is imported from the USSR, and PRC respectively. Two other refineries are under construction, and they will process crude extracted in the DPRK. Estimates point out that in 5-6 years the DPRK will no longer have to import petroleum products.</span></li></ol>
		<ol start="6" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs190C785" value="6"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Electricity: the network of hydro- and, especially, thermal plants will be expanded by putting online the thermal plant in Bukchang &nbsp;(with a capacity of 800 MW) and the hydroelectric plant at Seodusu (produced with Austrian and West German technology). Two other thermal plants are under construction at Namheung and Hamheung.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">With respect to foreign trade, it is to be expected that the DPRK will diversify its trade with capitalist and developed countries, especially with Japan, France and Federal Republic of Germany.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">We would like to draw your attention to the fact that the DPRK has demanded massive amounts of equipment and technology for industrial plants from many countries, so as to modernize and rapidly provide certain important economic sectors with high tech production means. We are aware of 35 such demands made to socialist countries, but especially to capitalist countries, which would cover the majority of sectors lagging behind. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Acquiring these means of production would obviously entail extraordinary financial efforts over the short-term.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Signed: Aurelian Lazar</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">C.
