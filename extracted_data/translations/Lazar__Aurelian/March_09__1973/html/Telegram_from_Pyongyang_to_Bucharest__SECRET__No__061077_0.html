Among these we mention the firm rejection of ideas such as &ldquo;confrontation&rdquo; or &ldquo;economic competition,&rdquo; supported by the South, together with the insistent mention of dialogue and multilateral cooperation.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Given the difficult conditions in which the planned session will be taking place, we expect it will ultimately amount to a re-affirmation of principles found in the Joint Communiqu&eacute;, the toning down of the tense atmosphere, the renewal of bilateral agreements concerning mutual reparations, and expressing points of view about the final purpose and stages of the dialogue between north and south.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Contacts at the level of Coordinating Committee will create the environment for reopening discussions between Red Cross Committees, expected for 21 March in Pyongyang. </span></p><p class="cs2D0A5422"><span class="cs566403DE">Signed: Aurelian Lazar</span></p></span>
