A South Korean border guard was shot, and weapons of Soviet origins were found on the premises of the incident. </span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">This incident was brought to the attention of Lee Hu-rak, the South Korean Co-president of the South-North Coordinating Committee.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">This incident worsens the state of inter-Korean relations, even more as in the following days a new meeting of the South-North Coordinating Committee is expected.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Signed: Aurelian Lazar</span></p></span>
