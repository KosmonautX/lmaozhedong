You have received the text in the clear.</span></p><p class="cs3BFD1D18"><span class="cs6D7AB2B9">Therefore under the guise of providing an amendment to our proposal, they are trying to push through right away, without discussing the substance of the issue, a decision about the provisional commission which is the core element of their draft resolution on Korea. We have objected to this amendment and will press for removing it, and in case of voting, will vote against it and against the resolution about inviting the Koreans as a whole if the amendment is not removed. Furthermore, we will make a statement on the reasons behind our vote pointing out that the American amendment is not compatible with the proposal of the Soviet delegation and has as its goal circumventing our proposal and reducing it to nothing. </span></p><p class="cs3BFD1D18"><span class="cs6D7AB2B9">A number of delegates (Australia, China and others) expressed their support of the American amendment. Apparently, on 30 October this amendment will be put to vote in the first half of the day. </span></p><p class="cs3BFD1D18"><span class="cs6D7AB2B9">I request an urgent response. </span></p><p class="cs7C1F8B9D"><span class="cs6D7AB2B9">VYSHINSKY</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs6D7AB2B9">29 October 1947</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs6D7AB2B9">30 October 1947</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs6D7AB2B9">1800 </span></p></span>
