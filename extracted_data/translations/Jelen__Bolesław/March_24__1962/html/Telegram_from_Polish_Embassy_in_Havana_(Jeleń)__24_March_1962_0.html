I am relaying the information presented today by Blas Roca</span><sup><span class="cs36E2AA4C">2</span></sup><span class="cs5EFED22F"> and Emilio Aragon&eacute;s [Navarro]</span><sup><span class="cs36E2AA4C">3</span></sup><span class="cs5EFED22F"> (secretary of the ORI [Organizaciones Revolucionarias Intergradas</span><sup><span class="cs36E2AA4C">4</span></sup><span class="cs5EFED22F">] to the heads of the diplomatic posts of the countries of the socialist camp. They asked that we relay this information to the central committees of [our] parties.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs5EFED22F">On the 22nd of this month, the national leadership of the ORI made a decision to exclude Anibal Escalante from the leadership of the ORI. A. E. remains a member of the ORI, but he&rsquo;s been removed from all the leadership positions.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs5EFED22F">[They said that the] motives [for the removal of Anibal Escalante were as follows]: as an organizational secretary of the ORI, A. E. used brutal and arbitrary methods of management, as well as intrigues aimed at concentrating control in his hands over the party and national apparatus. He used these methods towards other comrades regardless of their previous organizational membership [that is, whether they belonged to the former Popular Socialist Party or the &ldquo;26th of July Movement&rdquo;]. He managed to [take] control of a series of ministries, among others, the Ministry of Internal Affairs; he undertook the steps in order to control the military cadres. A. E.&rsquo;s arbitrary behavior could be already be detected in the 1940s, when he served in the leadership of the Popular Socialist Party, and later [when he was active in] the underground and [finally] after the collapse of the [Fulgencio Batista]</span><sup><span class="cs36E2AA4C">5</span></sup><span class="cs5EFED22F"> dictatorship. Various circumstances did not allow for putting an end to [Escalante&rsquo;s behavior] during these different periods.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The discussion related to the activities of A. E. began in February of this year under the older leadership. The resolution from the 22nd of this month was adopted without the participation of the new members of the current leadership (which was approved on the 8th of this month &ndash; see our Claris</span><sup><span class="cs36E2AA4C">6</span></sup><span class="cs5EFED22F"> 54), all of who did not participate in the previous phase of the discussion. [The resolution] will be presented to the public by Fidel [Castro]. The discussion focused only on [issues such as Escalante&rsquo;s] work methods and organizational matters, and not on the ideological issues. </span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The [Cuban] leadership will, unconditionally, adopt methods of collective leadership. They will hold meetings once a week under the current composition (24 members). The secretariat meets daily regarding [making] current decisions. They accelerated the process of creating the Revolutionary Party Cells (the equivalent of our POP [Basic Party Organizations]). They have not openly carried out their activities everywhere until now; the[se] activities were predominant in workplaces, especially among the management and administration. The membership selection to the Revolutionary Party Cells will be carried out strictly by taking political and moral aspects into consideration. The party will be composed of the cadres and it should count no more than 10 thousand members. The [party] congress will take place no earlier than at the end of the year.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs5EFED22F">There will be changes in the positions of provincial committee secretaries in four provinces (there are six provinces overall [in Cuba]). [These changes] are not connected with the activities of A. E., and they are a result of the weaknesses [exhibited by] some of the current secretaries.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs5EFED22F">In order to streamline [the work of] some departments, there will be some changes in the leadership. The most significant change pertains to the position of the minister of internal trade, because the poor organizational situation in the area of distribution. These changes do not have any political background (see our Claris 69 &ndash; [Manuel] Luzardo &ndash; from the former Popular Socialist Party, Celia Sanchez &ndash; Fidel&rsquo;s secretary until now).</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs5EFED22F">There is going to be a change regarding the position of the head of the Security Department in the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Brahantes is the one who is holding this position; he is a secretary and Fidel&rsquo;s aide.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs5EFED22F">II. In our Claris 67, we have already reported that the members of the &ldquo;26th of July Movement&rdquo;</span><sup><span class="cs36E2AA4C">7</span></sup><span class="cs5EFED22F"> are numerically predominant in the secretariat and the commission. The only one from the former Popular Socialist Party</span><sup><span class="cs36E2AA4C">8</span></sup><span class="cs5EFED22F"> who is currently a member of the secretariat is Blas Roca (the function of the organizational secretary is fully held by [Emilio] Aragones). As far as the organizational commission, only Luzardo remains [as the member of the former Popular Socialist Party]), and L. Pena holds a position in the syndical commission. </span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs5EFED22F">III. The information, which I presented in the first point of this cable, was relayed separately and individually to the ambassadors from the USSR, the PRC, and Albania, all of whom were not invited to the general meeting [of socialist countries]. [The North] Korean [ambassador] sent his secretary even though he attended a party soon before the meeting. The charge d&rsquo;affaires represented the [North] Vietnamese embassy.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs5EFED22F">IV. Anibal Escalante &ndash; an old member of the leadership of the Popular Socialist Party and its long-time organizational secretary. He worked for the Comintern and represented the Popular Socialist Party at the conference of 81 [communist and workers&rsquo;] parties.</span><sup><span class="cs36E2AA4C">9</span></sup><span class="cs5EFED22F"> After the formation of the ORI, he served as the organizational secretary. He joined the new leadership of the ORI that was approved on the 8th of this month.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csFAA46C7B">[1] Poland&rsquo;s Ambassador to Cuba (1961-1965).</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csFAA46C7B">[2] Blas Roca (1908 &ndash; 1987), a leading theoretician of the Cuban Revolution and the leader of the former Popular Socialist Party.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csFAA46C7B">[3] Emilio Aragon&eacute;s Navarro (1928 &ndash; 2007), one of the original members of the 26th of July Movement; friends with Ernesto &ldquo;Che&rdquo; Guevara.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csFAA46C7B">[4] Organizaciones Revolucionarias Integradas was formed in July 1961 following the Cuban Revolution and the fall of the Fulgencio Batista regime.
