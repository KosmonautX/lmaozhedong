For the time being the Soviet Union also failed to give its consent to the extension of the agreement on lumbering in Siberia by 3 years, because there are ecological surveys in progress [in these areas].</span></p><p class="csEA0546BE"><span class="cs566403DE">Ferenc Szab&oacute;<br>Ambassador</span></p></span>
