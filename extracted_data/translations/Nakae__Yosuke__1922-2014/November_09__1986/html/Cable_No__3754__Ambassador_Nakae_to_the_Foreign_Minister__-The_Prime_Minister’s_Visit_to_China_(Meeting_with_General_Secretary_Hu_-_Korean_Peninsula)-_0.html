He said among them one thing he wishes to set up is something like an LT office or, still better, a trade office. He also said that he would like China&rsquo;s cooperation in the 1988 Seoul Olympics.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">The Republic of Korea&rsquo;s leader is hoping also for four-party talks among the South, the North, China, and the United States, that is, among the parties to the truce talks. It seems that its good point is its ability to exclude the Soviet Union. Please consider it. &nbsp;For another thing, can&rsquo;t we have regular flights between Japan and China fly over South and North Korea? If it were possible, it would shorten them by as much as 40 minutes and would save energy as well.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Hu: &nbsp;The problem is that North Korea says that they do not want to do it.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Prime Minister: Simply having outbound flights go over North Korea and return flights go over South Korea would be fair, I think.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Hu: The problem lies in North Korea having no desire to do it. Even if North Korea does not become angry with Japan, it becomes angry with us.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Prime Minister: If something like an LT office is established between China and the Republic of Korea, then we can do something similar between Japan and North Korea. In so doing, we will be able to turn North Korea not in the direction of the Arctic Ocean but in our direction. I would like you to consider it.</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Hu: We can disclose this to the North Korean side and feel them out. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Prime Minister: &nbsp;I would like you to let me know as soon as you find out. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">Hu: Thank you for conveying to us the Republic of Korea&rsquo;s message. The Republic of Korea&rsquo;s desire for improved relations with China is a good thing. We are considering it from the position of the overall situation. We have to think of something acceptable to the North and something of which the other socialist countries could approve.</span></p><p class="csD270A203"><span class="cs566403DE">Prime Minister: I think that Eastern Europe would approve. Understandably, the Soviet Union may oppose it. The Soviet Union and North Korea are strengthening their military ties, so our attempt is meaningful. &nbsp;&nbsp;(End)</span></p></span>
