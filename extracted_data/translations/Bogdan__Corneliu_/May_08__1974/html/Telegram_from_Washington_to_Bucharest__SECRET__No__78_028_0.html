[John A.] Armitage, the messages sent by the Supreme People&rsquo;s Assembly in the Democratic People&#39;s Republic of Korea to the President of the US Senate, Gerald Ford, and, respectively, to the Speaker of the House, Carl Albert.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">J. Armitage said that he receives these messages while reserving the right to tell us his potential reactions afterwards. He mentioned that in the current circumstances the State Department had great reserves vis-&agrave;-vis such a way of communicating between the parliaments of two countries, the United States of America and North Korea, which do not have official state-to-state relations. Moreover, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State underlined, those messages had been sent to the US Congress after being released publicly and after the Americans learned that those messages did not include any concrete proposal.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The Department of State does not want such a way of communicating, in which the Department of State was involved, and which could stir up undesired reactions in Congress, become permanent.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Signed: Corneliu Bogdan</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Sent to: Nicolae Ceausescu; Stefan Andrei; First Direction &ndash; Relations; Third Direction &ndash; Relations</span></p></span>
