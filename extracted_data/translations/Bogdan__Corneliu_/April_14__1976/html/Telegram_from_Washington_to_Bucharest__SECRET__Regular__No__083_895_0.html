The situation in the Korean Peninsula remains possibly the most explosive one in Asia, with real possibilities to get the big powers involved in the eventuality of a conflict breaking out. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">2. Lately the political tensions in South Korea are rising. The intensification of anti-government demonstrations contributes to maintain this state of tension and the possibility to have the South Korean administration lose control over the situation, which would bring about an even tougher attitude towards the Democratic People&#39;s Republic of Korea, descending into an armed conflict. In addition to the fact that Seoul has a better economic situation, a better trained and better equipped army (the rapport would be 2 to 1 compared to the North Korean army), South Korea is amongst those countries which are capable of </span><span class="csE4EC0D56">producing nuclear weapons</span><span class="cs5EFED22F">, with all the restrictions and preventive measures imposed by the United States of America. All these could compel the Seoul authorities to undertake a military venture.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">3. Judging from the data of the Department of State, the Democratic People&#39;s Republic of Korea asked for a postponement of its foreign debt repayment, which indicates a bad economic situation. That, combined with an inaccurate understanding of the situation in South Korea (where anti-government demonstrations could be interpreted as a sign of the administration&rsquo;s weakness), could be a reason to accelerate [North Korea&rsquo;s] attacks on South Korea.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">4. The Department of State believes that action must be taken with respect to both states to make them abstain from measures or actions which would lead to an increase in the tension on the Korean Peninsula. Therefore, they believe that if the Korean matter cannot be taken off the agenda of the UN General Assembly session, debates should in any case be limited to realities, and sensitive areas which may trigger undesired effects should not be exacerbated.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Signed: Corneliu Bogdan</span></p></span>
