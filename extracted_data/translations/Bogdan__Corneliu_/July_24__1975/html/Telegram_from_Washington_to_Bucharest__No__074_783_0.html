			<li class="csBBF55D7E"><span class="cs5EFED22F">William Buffum, Assistant Secretary of State for International Organization Affairs, told me on July 23 this year that the American side considers the most controversial issue of the UN General Assembly agenda shall be the Korean one. In this context he mentioned again the US proposals for dismantling the UN headquarters for Korea, claiming it is a reasonable proposal meant to eliminate a source of anxiety and friction.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csBBF55D7E" value="2"><span class="cs5EFED22F">At the same time however the South Korean side has insistently asked the U.S not to take action towards withdrawal of troops from its territory, a thing which could generate a difficult situation both internally and externally for the South Korean government. The American interlocutor underlined that North Korean intentions preoccupy the Ford Administration most. Considering the &ldquo;changing&rdquo; and &ldquo;uncertain&rdquo; character of North Korean politics, the dismantling of the UN headquarters should be accompanied, according the US, by an agreement securing the ceasefire. In this context he showed interest in the results of the visit to Bucharest of the Democratic People&#39;s Republic of Korea President, particularly in the North Korean perspective on reunification and the Romanian opinion on evolutions in the Korean Peninsula.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="csE602B7F2"><span class="cs5EFED22F">I responded in the spirit of our main position in this issue, underlining the North Korean stance to act peacefully towards reunification while at the same time taking measures towards the withdrawal of foreign troops which by definition are a source of tension.&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csBBF55D7E" value="3"><span class="cs5EFED22F">In the discussions between Comrade Petre Anghel, 3rd Secretary, and John Farbes from the Korea Office of the State Department, the following points were made:&nbsp;</span></li></ol>
		<ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs9E227D9"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Up to the present moment the US has received no reactions from the sides interested in his letter concerning the dismantling of UN headquarters in Korea. The only condition imposed by the US was the recognition and backing by its signatories of the Korean ceasefire agreement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li></ol>
		<ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs9E227D9" value="2"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The US is nervous about the propaganda campaign launched by the Democratic People&#39;s Republic of Korea&mdash;a diplomatic offensive which has no other aim but internationally isolating South Korea. This campaign only increases tension in the Peninsula.&nbsp;</span></li></ol>
		<ol start="3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs9E227D9" value="3"><span class="cs5EFED22F">There is interest and some anxiety on the part of the US administration about the Democratic People&#39;s Republic of Korea&rsquo;s intentions; especially since recently the latter has disapproved of North-South meetings at Panmunjeom.&nbsp;</span></li></ol>
		<ol start="4" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs9E227D9" value="4"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Recent declarations of the Japanese government on the Korean issue are supposed to have emphasized the latter requires a solution originating from the Koreans themselves, as well as the responsibility of great powers to take preventive action against an escalation of tensions in the area.&nbsp;</span></li></ol>
