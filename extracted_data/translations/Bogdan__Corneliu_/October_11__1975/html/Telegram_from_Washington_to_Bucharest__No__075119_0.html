			<li class="cs190C785"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The situation on the Korean Peninsula makes for one of the potentially largest dangers, resulting not only from the concentration of military abilities of the two Korean states, but also from the very real possibility that, in case of threat, Japan as well as three of the great powers be drawn in: the US, U.S.S.R. and the People&rsquo;s Republic of China. As a result of events in Vietnam, the Korean solution has earned symbolic value for the US allies in the area, as well as in the context of US prestige in the world in general.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs176109F" value="2"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The resolution introduced by Algeria on the UN General Assembly agenda is entirely unacceptable to the US administration, and its adoption could have implications not only in that particular area, but can undercut the UN role as a peace-maintaining organization. As far as the US is concerned, the adoption of the above-mentioned resolution, depending also on the internal consultations within the administration, can result in the threat of withdrawal, or even in the withdrawal proper, from the UN with implicit consequences on the UN activity and on the d&eacute;tente. &nbsp;</span></li></ol>
		<ol start="3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs176109F" value="3"><span class="cs5EFED22F">A withdrawal of American troops from South Korea will seriously affect regional balance, and, in return, the US will have to support the arming of the Seoul government, particularly with developing the aviation. Moreover, there is the possibility that the government in Seoul, as a result of US withdrawal, decides on building nuclear capacity, for which it has both the technology and necessary materials. This will undoubtedly complicate the situation and will diminish chances for a peaceful solution.&nbsp;</span></li></ol>
		<ol start="4" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs176109F" value="4"><span class="cs5EFED22F">US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger&rsquo;s proposal to call for a conference of the Korean ceasefire signatories, as a condition for US acceptance of the UN headquarters dissolution, was not received with particular enthusiasm. The representatives of the P.R. China received it with significant coldness. The rigid position of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China is presumably a result of the Democratic People&#39;s Republic of Korea&rsquo;s tactics which, depending on the country&rsquo;s objectives, alternates emphasis at various stages on the U.S.S.R. or the People&rsquo;s Republic of China.&nbsp;</span></li></ol>
		<ol start="5" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs176109F" value="5"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The US are preoccupied at the moment with neutralizing the support for the Algerian resolution, which according to the US, as we previously pointed out, could cause general significant difficulties.&nbsp;</span></li></ol>
