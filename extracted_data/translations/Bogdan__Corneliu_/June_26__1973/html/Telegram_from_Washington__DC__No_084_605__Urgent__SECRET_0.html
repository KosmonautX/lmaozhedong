It is impossible to imagine, in the current circumstances, a sole representative of the two Koreas at the United Nations. Armitage, however, agreed that the general evolution of the situation in Korea is a positive one and [he thinks] it is good that dialogue continues between the interested parties.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Signed: Corneliu Bogdan</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F"><br><br></span></p></span>
