Aside from ethnic Koreans dispersed throughout PLA divisions, there are also four battalions, twenty-seven companies, and nine platoons composed of ethnic Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">On active duty, there are: two divisional, five regimental, eighty-seven battalion, 598 company, 400 platoon, and 1,900 squad commanders of Korean descent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Within the ranks of the PLA they all are receiving training and education and, under the guidance of their Chinese comrades, have made much progress. From our military, many of these soldiers have gained experience in carrying out operations, establishing armed forces, and launching political work. We feel most of them are fit to be cadres. After our army moved to South China, however, there was rioting among some of the ethnic Koreans; they demanded to be sent home [to Korea]. Nevertheless, the majority of these men continued to follow orders and unwaveringly pushed southward. At present the war is almost over. In the interests of the Korean people we should send these trained cadres back to Korea (those wishing to stay may stay). </span></p><p class="cs366E2583"><span class="cs566403DE">Would the Central Committee please discuss and relay to the Korean Workers&#39; Party as to if they may or may not be sent home at this time. If the answer is affirmative, we will assemble them into one standard division or four or five standard regiments and, after a brief period of training, will send them home.</span></p><p class="cs9D9298F5"><span class="cs566403DE">Please give instructions.</span></p><p class="cs9D9298F5"><span class="cs566403DE">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs7C1F8B9D"><span class="cs566403DE">Lin Biao</span></p><p class="cs7C1F8B9D"><span class="cs566403DE">Deng Zihui</span></p><p class="cs7C1F8B9D"><span class="cs566403DE">Tan Zhen.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs2654AE3A"><span class="cs566403DE">25 December 1949</span></p></span>
