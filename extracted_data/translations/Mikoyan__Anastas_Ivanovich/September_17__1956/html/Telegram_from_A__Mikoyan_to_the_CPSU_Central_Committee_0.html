The Korean delegates limited themselves to several obviously previously memorized phrases to explain what had happened there at the KWP plenum.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">It was evident that they are avoiding going beyond the bounds of the instructions they have received and it is essentially useless to discuss the situation in the Party with them. A record of the conversation with the Korean delegation is being sent separately via VCh.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Therefore it will not be possible to fulfill the CC instruction concerning the issues relating to the Korean Worker&#39;s Party in Peking. Summoning Kim Il Sung and the other Politburo members here might turn out to be impractical.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">It is not excluded that Kim Il Sung does not want to come there, especially since there is information that he has declared himself sick. The Koreans might consider departure of other Politburo members from the country difficult.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Therefore, essentially the only means for a discussion of the situation in the Korean Worker&#39;s Party is to go to Pyongyang for a day or two with representatives of the CC of the Communist Party of China after an exchange of opinions with the Chinese comrades and discuss this issue there.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F"><br>If there are no other instructions from the CC, we will act accordingly.</span></p><p class="cs1157FFE2"><span class="cs5EFED22F">A.
