In Brazil I met with President [João] Goulart, Prime Minister [Tancredo] Neves, Minister of International [Foreign] Affairs [San Tiago] Dantos, and a few other officials. In Mexico I had a short conversation with President [Adolfo] Lopez Mateos. Telegrams were dispatched to Moscow from these countries in which the character of these conversations was reported. I would like to report to the Central Committee a few more details and circumstances about the meetings and conversations which occurred in the USA which will help to complete the picture.</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">Firstly, what surprised American journalists and journalists of other Western nations accredited to Washington was the heightened interest of American society in the very fact, as [columnist Walter] Lippmann expressed it, of the contact between the USA and the USSR on various levels. When I was in the United States this concerned M. Kharlamov’s meeting with [White House press secretary] P[ierre]. Salinger. The newspapers made a lot of noise about the possibility of J. Kennedy making a trip to the USSR. Finally there was talk of the president’s inviting me to breakfast. There were a number of conjectures on this account and many direct questions at the time of the reception at the embassy, at which many notable American journalists were present: Lippmann, [St. Louis Post-Dispatch correspondent Marquis] Childs, [New York Times reporter James] Reston, [New York Herald-Tribune correspondent Marguerite] Higgins, directors of television and radio companies, etc. It was possible to understand from the conversations with these journalists, from the announcements of the services, that in the United States there is now a heightened nervousness and extraordinary interest in taking any step, which could occur in one way or another, that from the point of view of Americans promotes the possibility of reconciling American-Soviet differences. Much has happened to me in America, but I have never seen such agitated anticipation for the improvement of relations between our countries as exists now.</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev said that the hour has come—the American nation is beginning to wake up and Americans are ceasing to be lazy seals that warm themselves on warm shores. It is clear that the time is approaching. In any case, as the most experienced American journalists say frankly, in many respects they can’t figure Americans out. Thus Childs has said about the persecution of the Communist party in the USA: “If it was not for this occurring, it is possible that in the past thousands of Americans, especially the youth, would not have demonstrated a large interest towards Marxism and your ideas. Even now when I [visit] universities, because I am familiar with Russia in a way, they don’t ask me about my travels in other countries but what I think about communism.” When I told Lippmann that there is a very positive atmosphere at the Soviet embassy, he laughed and rejoined:</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">“And how! You’ve signed the German peace treaty, established a border in Berlin, put a gate there, and since you signed the agreement a war hasn’t started, and now everything is settling normally.”</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">I gave the appearance that I did not understand Lippmann, and said to him:</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">“The agreement is still not signed. You are clearly getting ahead of events.”</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">“No, it is you who have gotten ahead of events,” Lippmann remarked, “you understand everything wonderfully, and most importantly, your premier understands this.”</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">At this very moment a few other American journalists approached us, including Childs and Reston. Hearing what was being said, one of them remarked:</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">“I am sure that you will not sign the German peace treaty for a long time yet.”</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">“Why?” I asked.</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">“Because it is very convenient to have a callus on the foot of your neighbor who you don’t particularly like. There is always the possibility in such cases of unintentionally disturbing this callus and doing your neighbor harm, but then [you can] excuse yourself and say that it was an accident.”</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">At the time of the conversation about Germany and the problem of West Berlin it was perceived that the American journalists lacked the level of interest they had only a few months ago.</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">Violating all norms of protocol, a few dozen American journalists and Kennedy advisers stayed at the Soviet embassy until almost midnight. If I were to summarize the conversation that occurred that night it would go something like this. Eisenhower became president of the USA at first because in the eyes of the American people he was considered to be a hero of the Second World War. But the second time, in this very capacity, Eisenhower came forward like a peacemaker in the Korean War. His announcement that if elected he would succeed in achieving a Korean peace practically won him the presidency. Kennedy did not have many of Eisenhower’s advantages with regard to popularity. Kennedy’s administration, and the journalists and newspapers which supported Kennedy, including a number of prominent newspapers like the New York Times, tried to do his political business for him. The newspapers were full of various articles telling the story of the ascent of John Kennedy. They talked about his service in the navy during the war, and there were big advertisements on the occasion of his various appearances and speeches; there was [also] the story about the Kennedy family as being the ideal American family. One of the journalists even said to me as a joke: “We know that the Soviet Union struggles with the cult of personality. It is clear that we have begun our own cult of Kennedy and it may be that at some point we will have to struggle with this cult.”</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">It goes without saying that Kennedy was often worried and was preoccupied with the idea that it would be difficult for him to win the votes [needed] for a second term. Kennedy had already announced his candidacy and his administration was ready to actively cultivate public opinion; of that there could be no doubt. However, Kennedy himself, his brother, and those people closest to him until that time were extremely alarmed that Kennedy had not won the election with a very large advantage over the Republicans. Now they are making every effort to start a new election campaign and gain a firmer position from which to go to the polls against the Republicans more boldly. This circumstance is forcing Kennedy and his closest people to take various measures in connection with all of the following methods. I’ve already spoken about one of these, the Cult of Kennedy. A second is to present the affair in this manner – Kennedy has gathered around himself the most intelligent Americans and that he organized a dynamic administration. Not without obvious pleasure, journalists announced that Kennedy himself and those closest to him openly mocked Eisenhower who was now openly called the Golf President. In connection with this, Reston told me a joke, which as he expressed it, he tried not to tell to foreigners during the reign of Eisenhower: “When Ike planned to go to meet you, the Soviet Union, there were rumors in America that Mister Khrushchev prepared a field to play golf somewhere in Moscow.</span><sup><span class=\"cs6D6FB01F\">[1]</span></sup><span class=\"cs566403DE\"> In that connection we said: “When Ike plays golf in the USA that is only half the trouble. When he wins or loses in America it concerns only us Americans in the end. Premier Khrushchev will surely lose to Eisenhower at golf in the Soviet Union, and along with this victory, the old man will lose to Khrushchev in completely different terms.”</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">This was one extremely important thing for Kennedy and any other future American president. The President of the United States must be able to speak, so they say, with Soviet leaders. In the end, this advantage seemed to be the most important. With good reason, so they say, during agitation at meetings many voices really rallied around Kennedy, saying: “[Eisenhower’s vice president, Richard M.] Nixon cannot talk with Premier Khrushchev, and if he can it is only in the kitchen (in that way, the conversation between Nixon and N. S. Khrushchev in the kitchen of a typical American household during the American exhibition in Moscow [in July 1959] was ironically ridiculed.) Kennedy knows how to speak with Premier Khrushchev.”</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">The Kennedy administration has persistently influenced the American people in the manner described above. Kennedy himself and his circle, however, are worried that he will not be able to prove to Americans in time his ability to make agreements and reconcile the continuous questions about the Soviet Union. When Childs and I said goodbye to one another (Childs and I have been acquainted for a long time. We participated together in the New Year’s discussion in 1959 in Paris), he frankly said: “We came to the Soviet embassy today [and] spent so much time here because we supposed that Kennedy had obviously decided to show that he is seriously beginning a serious dialogue with Khrushchev.” I answered that I could not vouch for Kennedy but that as concerns the Soviet government it is always prepared for serious conversations regarding the resolution of differences. Childs added: “As you know, I sympathize with the Democrats and am worried about Kennedy. He maintains approximately 125,000 reservists in the army. This is 125,000 votes against him, plus their wives, fiancés, mothers, and fathers, that is, around half a million votes. In November 1962, elections will be held for the House of Representatives and one-third of the seats in the Senate. Although in the United States the president can do without a majority in either the Senate or the House, it is better to nevertheless have this majority. In this fashion, the November 1962 elections,” continued Childs, “will be a kind of rehearsal before his re-election campaign, which Kennedy will begin sometime in 1963.”</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">The day after my trip to Washington the president had me over for breakfast [on 30 January 1962], at which his wife, her sister and [Georgi] Bolshakov and his wife were in attendance.</span><sup><span class=\"cs6D6FB01F\">[2]</span></sup><span class=\"cs566403DE\"> This detail drew my attention. When I exchanged greetings with Kennedy he almost immediately directed the conversation towards Cuba and how I liked it there. Receiving a suitable answer, he paused a little and said:</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">“How is Che Guevara?”</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">I answered that he didn’t seem to look bad, although I didn’t see him often, and asked him in turn, why was the president suddenly interested in one of the participants of the Cuban revolution?</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">“I read some dispatches to the press,” answered Kennedy.</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">In turn I remarked: “You are interested in the events in Cuba, that is your right. But when we read that the USA plans to invade Cuba, we don’t think that this is your right.”</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">“We are not planning an invasion of Cuba,” Kennedy answered.</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">I reminded him: “And what of the mercenaries from Guantanamo and those other countries? You already changed your opinion regarding the landing in April 1961, that it was a mistake for America?”</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">Kennedy hit his fist on the table and said:</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">“Once I summoned [then CIA director] Allen Dulles and rebuked him. I said to him: ‘learn from the Russians. When they had a tough situation in Hungary [in 1956], they put an end to the conflict in just three days. When they didn’t like the events in Finland, the president of that country went to meet with the Soviet premier in Siberia, and everything was worked out. And you, Dulles, couldn’t do a thing.’”</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">I answered the President:</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">“With regard to Hungary, your analogy with Cuba is entirely untenable. With regard to Finland, well maybe this is the case, which should make the United States aware that they need to learn to respect Cuba. After all, we respect Finland. Even though Capitalist elements exist within it, the president of a bourgeois government retains good relations with the Soviet Union.”</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">Kennedy became quiet, and then with earnestness said:</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">“From a psychological point of view, it is very hard for the American people to agree with what is going on in Cuba. After all it is only 90 miles from our coast. It is very hard,” he repeated, and then added, “Cuba fell from within.”</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">“It is necessary to become reconciled with a great many things,” I remarked to the President. “And there are a great many things to become accustomed to, and it is clear that there are a great number of new things that the American people must get used to. Only do not meddle in events in Cuba, this is most important. But your people understand this.”</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">Kennedy remarked sharply:</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">“We will not meddle with events in Cuba.”</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">“It’s a very big shame, Mister President,” I said to him, “that your words are not allowed to be published in the newspapers.”</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">Kennedy asked the question: “How would Castro react to the fact that you were invited to Washington from Havana?”</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">I said that Castro was very happy about this, he has an appreciation for peaceful coexistence which would include an improvement in US relations.</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">“We can talk more about this after breakfast, if you permit it.”</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">Then, as I have already written, Kennedy sent Salinger and [US interpreter Alexander A.] Akalovsky away, and asked Bolshakov to be the interpreter. The conversation continued for almost two hours. The content of the conversation has already been announced from Washington.</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">In the course of the conversation, Kennedy said that he was going to a press conference the following day, one which was usually held at the State Department. At the press conference there were more than 400 journalists present. There was a heightened sense of interest towards it. Although this conference occurred immediately after the completion of the conference in Punta-del-Este, Kennedy was, however, literally tongue-tied and uttered only a few words about the inter-American conference.</span><sup><span class=\"cs6D6FB01F\">[3]</span></sup></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">He was not asked one question in connection with this conference. In the corridors American journalists asked: “What is there to ask the president, when the United States has failed? Brazil, Mexico and other nations gave us a slap in the face.”</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">There was one question asked which frustrated Kennedy. One of the journalists asked: “In connection with the conclusion of the conference at Punta-del-Este, did the United States return to normal trade relations with Cuba, or will it still not be possible to buy cigars there?” In a malcontented tone, [Kennedy responded] “I am not involved in the proceedings of that event. It seems that there is some talk about the sale of some medical supplies. Maybe we will receive cigars in return.” And that prompted an explosion of laughter in the hall.</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">A few questions about Soviet-American relations were asked, which included one question about whether Kennedy is planning to visit the Soviet Union and whether or not he has some kind of invitation to do so. Kennedy was troubled by this question, and was feeling particularly clumsy because of the presence of Soviet journalists. His answer was evasive, meaning approximately that he would like to [visit the Soviet Union], but he was not invited.</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">At that time the theme of Kennedy traveling to the Soviet Union and meeting with N. S. Khrushchev appeared continuously in American newspapers. Americans with whom I have had the opportunity to speak ask this question if they are in some way interested in political questions.</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">I would also like to point out one more fact in connection with Kennedy’s press conference. He was asked many empty, overtly demagogic questions on third-rate problems. This created the impression that this “waste of time” is a very “American tradition” created by the imperial propaganda machine for the befuddlement of the people.</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">After the press conference, Kennedy asked about one more meeting, which as he expressed it would be of a strictly confidential character. This has already been reported to Moscow.</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">Mind you, the president has a fear of being simple and open before Soviet journalists. Through Bolshakov, Salinger agreed that at 6:00 that evening he would send a car for me from the White House, in which I would ride around the city so that journalists would not discover the president’s new meeting with a Soviet editor. And sure enough, the car carried us down some long streets, and at last we arrived at the White House at the president’s private entrance. The gate opened quickly, we were asked for no documents, and the car went immediately through the entrance.</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">Kennedy was waiting and walking around the corridor. He immediately came into the room and in a nervous tone began the conversation. Gesticulating, he said: “Your armies are in Europe. I know the strength and potential of your military machine. Khrushchev can, of course”—and Kennedy made a gesture with his hands—“can take West Berlin. But then this would possibly provoke a rupture of relations between the Western nations and your nation and lead to tension.”</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">“I want to emphasize to you again with all seriousness that it is my plan to find some [mutually] beneficial solution to this problem, which does not encroach on the positions that you cannot give up, as well as those positions, from which we cannot retreat. I ask you to report, and if possible, to do it [only] orally, that the US, England, and France are opposed to German reunification. Such a dynamic and powerful state would be a cause of concern for us. We realize that unification is unrealistic; however, [publicly] I must speak about unification. And because of this there could be no talk about recognizing the GDR [German Democratic Republic; East Germany], and nor the border on the Elbe [i.e. the border between the two Germanys]. With respect to other border questions, it is completely possible that steps intended to regulate our disputes will lead to an announcement of the recognition of borders on the Oder and Neisse.”</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">Kennedy very insistently, as in the first conversation, harped on the idea that in the next several years it will be necessary to work out some mutually-agreeable relations that will lead to some softening of the general world situation and permit, as he expressed it, a more composed perspective from which to observe the state of affairs in the world. In connection with this he said that in Laos he will “tie Boun Oum’s arms” if for our part we guarantee him the Pathet Lao’s equanimity.</span><sup><span class=\"cs6D6FB01F\">[4]</span></sup></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">Kennedy is clearly worried about the situation in Southeast Asia and particularly, of course, in South Vietnam. He did not answer any questions about South Vietnam and the position of the United States in South Korea and did not want to continue the conversation on this theme, uttering the general phrase that neither the USSR nor the USA had any major interests in that region and we have to keep this in mind before all other things. He once again repeated the idea previously addressed that the United States of America and the Soviet Union send many weapons there, but these weapons and these complications can be used by a third power more interested in a conflict between the USA and the USSR.</span><sup><span class=\"cs6D6FB01F\">[5]</span></sup></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">Then Kennedy long-windedly talked about how he emphasized with utmost urgency the Berlin problem. Continuing the previous conversation, he said that he would like a more constructive and, as he stated it more precisely, a more personal dialogue between [Soviet Foreign] Minister [Andrei] Gromyko and [US Ambassador in Moscow Llewellyn E.] Thompson insofar as they now only exchange general declarations. “We would like,” Kennedy said, “for them to sit at a table, have in their hands the map of Germany and begin to look for possibilities for a settlement, which would be equally agreeable to the Soviet Union and the United States of America. I want your government to understand: it is impossible for us to leave West Berlin or to permit a Soviet military presence there.” In connection with my question, Why can’t the question of a guarantee come from the United Nations or the neutral nations[?], he said that this is also not possible, that it would lead to the total collapse of the Western Bloc. “You understand,” he began to say in a concerned way, “the more complex our relations become in Berlin and Germany, the more insistent [West German Chancellor Konrad] Adenauer becomes. For the time being I am restraining him and have sufficient arguments for not giving him atomic weapons. However, these high-level complications that are arising between us are prompting retaliatory forces in West Berlin.” Kennedy was obviously calculating that this phrase on some level would, if not frighten us per se, intimidate us.</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">Kennedy answered: “It is not that we are afraid of West Germany and the president understands this perfectly.” Maybe this is a delicate question – I asked Kennedy whether the United States was afraid of West Germany, or still more whether England and France were afraid of West Germany.</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">“It is possible to be afraid of the Germans,” Kennedy answered. Then he said: “I understand that you and your allies can’t use the words ‘occupation force.’ But with regard to a small contingent of soldiers, it would be possible to find a different name. Now about the access,” Kennedy continued. “I see things realistically. Insofar as you object to international control of the highway [between West Berlin and West Germany], it is senseless for us to insist on it. After all the officers of the GDR are already (I thanked the president for pronouncing the full name, the German Democratic Republic, before me for the first time) putting their stamps [in documents]. The important thing is not who is affixing the stamps. Could you and I fantasize a bit (this is exactly what he said) about some compromise steps regarding Western powers’ access to West Berlin? We are ready to meet the Soviet Union halfway and we will not have political ties with the FRG [Federal Republic of Germany; West Germany]. Maybe you too could meet us halfway in terms of some softening on the Western positions in the issue of access.</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">Then the president developed this idea: the situation could arise that the Soviet fleet was carried by storm into the waters of [Francisco] Franco’s Spain. “In such a case you would not be able to make contact with Franco, but would you not ask that a third power somehow intercede on your behalf?”</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">“We already tried to do this, when the question arose about the Soviet tanker Tuapse, which was seized in a bandit fashion by your friend Chiang Kai Shek [Jiang Jieshi] and nothing came of out it.”</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">“Let’s not talk about the past,” the president said. “We also have friends we don’t like. So, if an American caravan of freight cars gets into a conflict on a highway, we cannot – and don’t not try forcing us to do —do it – beginning a dialogue with [GDR leader Walter] Ulbricht. It would clearly mean being pulled into recognizing the GDR. To whom would we turn in such a case to deescalate, to untie this crisis?”</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">I answered that if it was defined by this simple analogy, it was obvious [that the US would turn] to some sort of third power.</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">Kennedy said: “Now maybe it will be worthwhile to fantasize around this.” Once again he emphasized: “We understand we cannot win international control, and of course it is foolish to cling to that which will not be put in writing.”</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">Then Kennedy spoke about how they worked out with [British Prime Minister Harold] Macmillan a new pretext for disarmament, which he considers would meet with a constructive response from the Soviet government side.</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">(One can imagine how stunned Kennedy was when he heard about our plan to convene the Eighteen Nation Disarmament Committee at the highest level. This undoubtedly struck out Kennedy and Macmillan’s hopes to [have the] initiative.) Then Kennedy said that he personally welcomes the contact which existed between Bolshakov and Robert Kennedy, insofar as it gives him the possibility to manage without the services of a translator from the State Department. These observations show that surely in the presence of Akolovsky and even Salinger – a person closer to him the president speaks with a completely different tongue and is visibly more tense.</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">He asked: “Was your conversation with Robert Kennedy after breakfast interesting?”</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">I answered that his brother was quiet and said almost nothing about international problems. Then I matter-of-factly asked the president:</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">“I recently saw in Life magazine a big portrait of your brother, Robert Kennedy, below which was a passage: ‘The number 2 man. The hard-line, unrelenting, younger brother.’ Is this accurate that Robert Kennedy has become the #2 man in the USA?”</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">Kennedy was surprised:</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">“Even you turned your attention to this? I spoke with my brother on this subject and said to him that if he is planning to become No. 1 this would not be so easy for him, and that he would sooner become No. 3, No. 4, No. 5, No. 6.”</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">“By the way – remarked Kennedy – there was quite a scandal with regard to [my] brother’s [proposed] trip to the Soviet Union. We are now trying to find a person in the State Department, who [could] make it public that Robert might visit the Soviet Union as a private citizen. I very much wanted him to meet with Chairman Khrushchev. But when the American press created a scandal, we were forced to deny it. Clearly, here we need to arrange all these things more simply,” remarked Kennedy. “Look here, you invited Salinger to Moscow and the Republicans are already attacking Salinger and me.”</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">Saying goodbye after the conversation, he asked me to give his greetings to N. S. Khrushchev in the hopes, as he said smiling “of the possibility of a calmer meeting than in Vienna, where I was more concerned about how to behave in front of a whole pack of journalists.”</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">Then Kennedy asked me how I spent my day in Washington. I answered that Washington is always boring because there is nowhere to go here: there are no theaters, no good concert hall. “But tomorrow you will have a violin concert —I noted—it will be quite interesting to attend.”</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">“Yes,” Kennedy confirmed, “Washington is certainly a capital without theaters. As you know, we plan to build a large cultural center in Washington, but this would require nearly 30 million dollars. Right now my wife and I are occupied with writing letters to various parties to give donations for the construction. But it is going very slowly. People don’t want to part with the money.”</span><sup><span class=\"cs6D6FB01F\">[6]</span></sup></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">“But why wouldn’t you, Mr. President,” I asked Kennedy, “give the money from your own private means? After all your family is very rich, and if you made such a grand gesture you would probably obtain a good many kind words for your own household.”</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">Kennedy smiled and said completely frankly:</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">“Yes, but here we are talking about my own money.”</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">The next morning when I was intending to leave for New York to board my flight for Mexico, [former US ambassador to Moscow and now State Department official W. Averell] Harriman unexpectedly called me and said that he was prepared to go to the Soviet Embassy to see me for a few minutes or, if it was more convenient, asked me to see him. I answered that it would be better if I dropped in on Mr. Harriman. The conversation with Harriman took 15 or 20 minutes and was of a general character. Harriman was concerned with Laos, and reiterated Kennedy’s idea a few times that it would be good to agree about Laos. Then he asked me to send Khrushchev a big hello and said that he remembered the meeting with Nikita Sergeevich and was happy to welcome him at his home.</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">“All our family remembers this visit and remembers that the Chairman carried the conversation lightly and nonchalantly,” Harriman said. “I am an old man but I dream about a new meeting with Khrushchev and am sure we will certainly speak about US-Soviet relations.”</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">Harriman asked permission for several journalists and photographers to come into his office and repeat his greeting for N. S. Khrushchev and to say again in the presence of the press that he would like to meet with N. S. Khrushchev to discuss many important problems. This was all obviously done with the consideration that Harriman’s name would once again appear in print, especially in connection with [the fact] that he is acquainted with and has spoken to N. S. Khrushchev.</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs566403DE\">Adzhubei</span></p><p class=\"cs2D0A5422\"><span class=\"cs9A2F8768\">[1] Ed.

      "TOP SECRETDuring my visit to Washington, Brazil, and passing through Mexico, I had a few meetings with US President John Kennedy, his brother, Robert Kennedy, and a few other figures from the President’s circle. In Brazil I met with President [João] Goulart, Prime Minister [Tancredo] Neves, Minister of International [Foreign] Affairs [San Tiago] Dantos, and a few other officials. In Mexico I had a short conversation with President [Adolfo] Lopez Mateos. Telegrams were dispatched to Moscow from these countries in which the character of these conversations was reported. I would like to report to the Central Committee a few more details and circumstances about the meetings and conversations which occurred in the USA which will help to complete the picture.Firstly, what surprised American journalists and journalists of other Western nations accredited to Washington was the heightened interest of American society in the very fact, as [columnist Walter] Lippmann expressed it, of the contact between the USA and the USSR on various levels. When I was in the United States this concerned M. Kharlamov’s meeting with [White House press secretary] P[ierre]. Salinger. The newspapers made a lot of noise about the possibility of J. Kennedy making a trip to the USSR. Finally there was talk of the president’s inviting me to breakfast. There were a number of conjectures on this account and many direct questions at the time of the reception at the embassy, at which many notable American journalists were present: Lippmann, [St. Louis Post-Dispatch correspondent Marquis] Childs, [New York Times reporter James] Reston, [New York Herald-Tribune correspondent Marguerite] Higgins, directors of television and radio companies, etc. It was possible to understand from the conversations with these journalists, from the announcements of the services, that in the United States there is now a heightened nervousness and extraordinary interest in taking any step, which could occur in one way or another, that from the point of view of Americans promotes the possibility of reconciling American-Soviet differences. Much has happened to me in America, but I have never seen such agitated anticipation for the improvement of relations between our countries as exists now.Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev said that the hour has come—the American nation is beginning to wake up and Americans are ceasing to be lazy seals that warm themselves on warm shores. It is clear that the time is approaching. In any case, as the most experienced American journalists say frankly, in many respects they can’t figure Americans out. Thus Childs has said about the persecution of the Communist party in the USA: “If it was not for this occurring, it is possible that in the past thousands of Americans, especially the youth, would not have demonstrated a large interest towards Marxism and your ideas. Even now when I [visit] universities, because I am familiar with Russia in a way, they don’t ask me about my travels in other countries but what I think about communism.” When I told Lippmann that there is a very positive atmosphere at the Soviet embassy, he laughed and rejoined:“And how! You’ve signed the German peace treaty, established a border in Berlin, put a gate there, and since you signed the agreement a war hasn’t started, and now everything is settling normally.”I gave the appearance that I did not understand Lippmann, and said to him:“The agreement is still not signed. You are clearly getting ahead of events.”“No, it is you who have gotten ahead of events,” Lippmann remarked, “you understand everything wonderfully, and most importantly, your premier understands this.”At this very moment a few other American journalists approached us, including Childs and Reston. Hearing what was being said, one of them remarked:“I am sure that you will not sign the German peace treaty for a long time yet.”“Why?” I asked.“Because it is very convenient to have a callus on the foot of your neighbor who you don’t particularly like. There is always the possibility in such cases of unintentionally disturbing this callus and doing your neighbor harm, but then [you can] excuse yourself and say that it was an accident.”At the time of the conversation about Germany and the problem of West Berlin it was perceived that the American journalists lacked the level of interest they had only a few months ago.Violating all norms of protocol, a few dozen American journalists and Kennedy advisers stayed at the Soviet embassy until almost midnight. If I were to summarize the conversation that occurred that night it would go something like this. Eisenhower became president of the USA at first because in the eyes of the American people he was considered to be a hero of the Second World War. But the second time, in this very capacity, Eisenhower came forward like a peacemaker in the Korean War. His announcement that if elected he would succeed in achieving a Korean peace practically won him the presidency. Kennedy did not have many of Eisenhower’s advantages with regard to popularity. Kennedy’s administration, and the journalists and newspapers which supported Kennedy, including a number of prominent newspapers like the New York Times, tried to do his political business for him. The newspapers were full of various articles telling the story of the ascent of John Kennedy. They talked about his service in the navy during the war, and there were big advertisements on the occasion of his various appearances and speeches; there was [also] the story about the Kennedy family as being the ideal American family. One of the journalists even said to me as a joke: “We know that the Soviet Union struggles with the cult of personality. It is clear that we have begun our own cult of Kennedy and it may be that at some point we will have to struggle with this cult.”It goes without saying that Kennedy was often worried and was preoccupied with the idea that it would be difficult for him to win the votes [needed] for a second term. Kennedy had already announced his candidacy and his administration was ready to actively cultivate public opinion; of that there could be no doubt. However, Kennedy himself, his brother, and those people closest to him until that time were extremely alarmed that Kennedy had not won the election with a very large advantage over the Republicans. Now they are making every effort to start a new election campaign and gain a firmer position from which to go to the polls against the Republicans more boldly. This circumstance is forcing Kennedy and his closest people to take various measures in connection with all of the following methods. I’ve already spoken about one of these, the Cult of Kennedy. A second is to present the affair in this manner – Kennedy has gathered around himself the most intelligent Americans and that he organized a dynamic administration. Not without obvious pleasure, journalists announced that Kennedy himself and those closest to him openly mocked Eisenhower who was now openly called the Golf President. In connection with this, Reston told me a joke, which as he expressed it, he tried not to tell to foreigners during the reign of Eisenhower: “When Ike planned to go to meet you, the Soviet Union, there were rumors in America that Mister Khrushchev prepared a field to play golf somewhere in Moscow.[1] In that connection we said: “When Ike plays golf in the USA that is only half the trouble. When he wins or loses in America it concerns only us Americans in the end. Premier Khrushchev will surely lose to Eisenhower at golf in the Soviet Union, and along with this victory, the old man will lose to Khrushchev in completely different terms.”This was one extremely important thing for Kennedy and any other future American president. The President of the United States must be able to speak, so they say, with Soviet leaders. In the end, this advantage seemed to be the most important. With good reason, so they say, during agitation at meetings many voices really rallied around Kennedy, saying: “[Eisenhower’s vice president, Richard M.] Nixon cannot talk with Premier Khrushchev, and if he can it is only in the kitchen (in that way, the conversation between Nixon and N. S. Khrushchev in the kitchen of a typical American household during the American exhibition in Moscow [in July 1959] was ironically ridiculed.) Kennedy knows how to speak with Premier Khrushchev.”The Kennedy administration has persistently influenced the American people in the manner described above. Kennedy himself and his circle, however, are worried that he will not be able to prove to Americans in time his ability to make agreements and reconcile the continuous questions about the Soviet Union. When Childs and I said goodbye to one another (Childs and I have been acquainted for a long time. We participated together in the New Year’s discussion in 1959 in Paris), he frankly said: “We came to the Soviet embassy today [and] spent so much time here because we supposed that Kennedy had obviously decided to show that he is seriously beginning a serious dialogue with Khrushchev.” I answered that I could not vouch for Kennedy but that as concerns the Soviet government it is always prepared for serious conversations regarding the resolution of differences. Childs added: “As you know, I sympathize with the Democrats and am worried about Kennedy. He maintains approximately 125,000 reservists in the army. This is 125,000 votes against him, plus their wives, fiancés, mothers, and fathers, that is, around half a million votes. In November 1962, elections will be held for the House of Representatives and one-third of the seats in the Senate. Although in the United States the president can do without a majority in either the Senate or the House, it is better to nevertheless have this majority. In this fashion, the November 1962 elections,” continued Childs, “will be a kind of rehearsal before his re-election campaign, which Kennedy will begin sometime in 1963.”The day after my trip to Washington the president had me over for breakfast [on 30 January 1962], at which his wife, her sister and [Georgi] Bolshakov and his wife were in attendance.[2] This detail drew my attention. When I exchanged greetings with Kennedy he almost immediately directed the conversation towards Cuba and how I liked it there. Receiving a suitable answer, he paused a little and said:“How is Che Guevara?”I answered that he didn’t seem to look bad, although I didn’t see him often, and asked him in turn, why was the president suddenly interested in one of the participants of the Cuban revolution?“I read some dispatches to the press,” answered Kennedy.In turn I remarked: “You are interested in the events in Cuba, that is your right. But when we read that the USA plans to invade Cuba, we don’t think that this is your right.”“We are not planning an invasion of Cuba,” Kennedy answered.I reminded him: “And what of the mercenaries from Guantanamo and those other countries? You already changed your opinion regarding the landing in April 1961, that it was a mistake for America?”Kennedy hit his fist on the table and said:“Once I summoned [then CIA director] Allen Dulles and rebuked him. I said to him: ‘learn from the Russians. When they had a tough situation in Hungary [in 1956], they put an end to the conflict in just three days. When they didn’t like the events in Finland, the president of that country went to meet with the Soviet premier in Siberia, and everything was worked out. And you, Dulles, couldn’t do a thing.’”I answered the President:“With regard to Hungary, your analogy with Cuba is entirely untenable. With regard to Finland, well maybe this is the case, which should make the United States aware that they need to learn to respect Cuba. After all, we respect Finland. Even though Capitalist elements exist within it, the president of a bourgeois government retains good relations with the Soviet Union.”Kennedy became quiet, and then with earnestness said:“From a psychological point of view, it is very hard for the American people to agree with what is going on in Cuba. After all it is only 90 miles from our coast. It is very hard,” he repeated, and then added, “Cuba fell from within.”“It is necessary to become reconciled with a great many things,” I remarked to the President. “And there are a great many things to become accustomed to, and it is clear that there are a great number of new things that the American people must get used to. Only do not meddle in events in Cuba, this is most important. But your people understand this.”Kennedy remarked sharply:“We will not meddle with events in Cuba.”“It’s a very big shame, Mister President,” I said to him, “that your words are not allowed to be published in the newspapers.”Kennedy asked the question: “How would Castro react to the fact that you were invited to Washington from Havana?”I said that Castro was very happy about this, he has an appreciation for peaceful coexistence which would include an improvement in US relations.“We can talk more about this after breakfast, if you permit it.”Then, as I have already written, Kennedy sent Salinger and [US interpreter Alexander A.] Akalovsky away, and asked Bolshakov to be the interpreter. The conversation continued for almost two hours. The content of the conversation has already been announced from Washington.In the course of the conversation, Kennedy said that he was going to a press conference the following day, one which was usually held at the State Department. At the press conference there were more than 400 journalists present. There was a heightened sense of interest towards it. Although this conference occurred immediately after the completion of the conference in Punta-del-Este, Kennedy was, however, literally tongue-tied and uttered only a few words about the inter-American conference.[3]He was not asked one question in connection with this conference. In the corridors American journalists asked: “What is there to ask the president, when the United States has failed? Brazil, Mexico and other nations gave us a slap in the face.”There was one question asked which frustrated Kennedy. One of the journalists asked: “In connection with the conclusion of the conference at Punta-del-Este, did the United States return to normal trade relations with Cuba, or will it still not be possible to buy cigars there?” In a malcontented tone, [Kennedy responded] “I am not involved in the proceedings of that event. It seems that there is some talk about the sale of some medical supplies. Maybe we will receive cigars in return.” And that prompted an explosion of laughter in the hall.A few questions about Soviet-American relations were asked, which included one question about whether Kennedy is planning to visit the Soviet Union and whether or not he has some kind of invitation to do so. Kennedy was troubled by this question, and was feeling particularly clumsy because of the presence of Soviet journalists. His answer was evasive, meaning approximately that he would like to [visit the Soviet Union], but he was not invited.At that time the theme of Kennedy traveling to the Soviet Union and meeting with N. S. Khrushchev appeared continuously in American newspapers. Americans with whom I have had the opportunity to speak ask this question if they are in some way interested in political questions.I would also like to point out one more fact in connection with Kennedy’s press conference. He was asked many empty, overtly demagogic questions on third-rate problems. This created the impression that this “waste of time” is a very “American tradition” created by the imperial propaganda machine for the befuddlement of the people.After the press conference, Kennedy asked about one more meeting, which as he expressed it would be of a strictly confidential character. This has already been reported to Moscow.Mind you, the president has a fear of being simple and open before Soviet journalists. Through Bolshakov, Salinger agreed that at 6:00 that evening he would send a car for me from the White House, in which I would ride around the city so that journalists would not discover the president’s new meeting with a Soviet editor. And sure enough, the car carried us down some long streets, and at last we arrived at the White House at the president’s private entrance. The gate opened quickly, we were asked for no documents, and the car went immediately through the entrance.Kennedy was waiting and walking around the corridor. He immediately came into the room and in a nervous tone began the conversation. Gesticulating, he said: “Your armies are in Europe. I know the strength and potential of your military machine. Khrushchev can, of course”—and Kennedy made a gesture with his hands—“can take West Berlin. But then this would possibly provoke a rupture of relations between the Western nations and your nation and lead to tension.”“I want to emphasize to you again with all seriousness that it is my plan to find some [mutually] beneficial solution to this problem, which does not encroach on the positions that you cannot give up, as well as those positions, from which we cannot retreat. I ask you to report, and if possible, to do it [only] orally, that the US, England, and France are opposed to German reunification. Such a dynamic and powerful state would be a cause of concern for us. We realize that unification is unrealistic; however, [publicly] I must speak about unification. And because of this there could be no talk about recognizing the GDR [German Democratic Republic; East Germany], and nor the border on the Elbe [i.e. the border between the two Germanys]. With respect to other border questions, it is completely possible that steps intended to regulate our disputes will lead to an announcement of the recognition of borders on the Oder and Neisse.”Kennedy very insistently, as in the first conversation, harped on the idea that in the next several years it will be necessary to work out some mutually-agreeable relations that will lead to some softening of the general world situation and permit, as he expressed it, a more composed perspective from which to observe the state of affairs in the world. In connection with this he said that in Laos he will “tie Boun Oum’s arms” if for our part we guarantee him the Pathet Lao’s equanimity.[4]Kennedy is clearly worried about the situation in Southeast Asia and particularly, of course, in South Vietnam. He did not answer any questions about South Vietnam and the position of the United States in South Korea and did not want to continue the conversation on this theme, uttering the general phrase that neither the USSR nor the USA had any major interests in that region and we have to keep this in mind before all other things. He once again repeated the idea previously addressed that the United States of America and the Soviet Union send many weapons there, but these weapons and these complications can be used by a third power more interested in a conflict between the USA and the USSR.[5]Then Kennedy long-windedly talked about how he emphasized with utmost urgency the Berlin problem. Continuing the previous conversation, he said that he would like a more constructive and, as he stated it more precisely, a more personal dialogue between [Soviet Foreign] Minister [Andrei] Gromyko and [US Ambassador in Moscow Llewellyn E.] Thompson insofar as they now only exchange general declarations. “We would like,” Kennedy said, “for them to sit at a table, have in their hands the map of Germany and begin to look for possibilities for a settlement, which would be equally agreeable to the Soviet Union and the United States of America. I want your government to understand: it is impossible for us to leave West Berlin or to permit a Soviet military presence there.” In connection with my question, Why can’t the question of a guarantee come from the United Nations or the neutral nations[?], he said that this is also not possible, that it would lead to the total collapse of the Western Bloc. “You understand,” he began to say in a concerned way, “the more complex our relations become in Berlin and Germany, the more insistent [West German Chancellor Konrad] Adenauer becomes. For the time being I am restraining him and have sufficient arguments for not giving him atomic weapons. However, these high-level complications that are arising between us are prompting retaliatory forces in West Berlin.” Kennedy was obviously calculating that this phrase on some level would, if not frighten us per se, intimidate us.Kennedy answered: “It is not that we are afraid of West Germany and the president understands this perfectly.” Maybe this is a delicate question – I asked Kennedy whether the United States was afraid of West Germany, or still more whether England and France were afraid of West Germany.“It is possible to be afraid of the Germans,” Kennedy answered. Then he said: “I understand that you and your allies can’t use the words ‘occupation force.’ But with regard to a small contingent of soldiers, it would be possible to find a different name. Now about the access,” Kennedy continued. “I see things realistically. Insofar as you object to international control of the highway [between West Berlin and West Germany], it is senseless for us to insist on it. After all the officers of the GDR are already (I thanked the president for pronouncing the full name, the German Democratic Republic, before me for the first time) putting their stamps [in documents]. The important thing is not who is affixing the stamps. Could you and I fantasize a bit (this is exactly what he said) about some compromise steps regarding Western powers’ access to West Berlin? We are ready to meet the Soviet Union halfway and we will not have political ties with the FRG [Federal Republic of Germany; West Germany]. Maybe you too could meet us halfway in terms of some softening on the Western positions in the issue of access.Then the president developed this idea: the situation could arise that the Soviet fleet was carried by storm into the waters of [Francisco] Franco’s Spain. “In such a case you would not be able to make contact with Franco, but would you not ask that a third power somehow intercede on your behalf?”“We already tried to do this, when the question arose about the Soviet tanker Tuapse, which was seized in a bandit fashion by your friend Chiang Kai Shek [Jiang Jieshi] and nothing came of out it.”“Let’s not talk about the past,” the president said. “We also have friends we don’t like. So, if an American caravan of freight cars gets into a conflict on a highway, we cannot – and don’t not try forcing us to do —do it – beginning a dialogue with [GDR leader Walter] Ulbricht. It would clearly mean being pulled into recognizing the GDR. To whom would we turn in such a case to deescalate, to untie this crisis?”I answered that if it was defined by this simple analogy, it was obvious [that the US would turn] to some sort of third power.Kennedy said: “Now maybe it will be worthwhile to fantasize around this.” Once again he emphasized: “We understand we cannot win international control, and of course it is foolish to cling to that which will not be put in writing.”Then Kennedy spoke about how they worked out with [British Prime Minister Harold] Macmillan a new pretext for disarmament, which he considers would meet with a constructive response from the Soviet government side.(One can imagine how stunned Kennedy was when he heard about our plan to convene the Eighteen Nation Disarmament Committee at the highest level. This undoubtedly struck out Kennedy and Macmillan’s hopes to [have the] initiative.) Then Kennedy said that he personally welcomes the contact which existed between Bolshakov and Robert Kennedy, insofar as it gives him the possibility to manage without the services of a translator from the State Department. These observations show that surely in the presence of Akolovsky and even Salinger – a person closer to him the president speaks with a completely different tongue and is visibly more tense.He asked: “Was your conversation with Robert Kennedy after breakfast interesting?”I answered that his brother was quiet and said almost nothing about international problems. Then I matter-of-factly asked the president:“I recently saw in Life magazine a big portrait of your brother, Robert Kennedy, below which was a passage: ‘The number 2 man. The hard-line, unrelenting, younger brother.’ Is this accurate that Robert Kennedy has become the #2 man in the USA?”Kennedy was surprised:“Even you turned your attention to this? I spoke with my brother on this subject and said to him that if he is planning to become No. 1 this would not be so easy for him, and that he would sooner become No. 3, No. 4, No. 5, No. 6.”“By the way – remarked Kennedy – there was quite a scandal with regard to [my] brother’s [proposed] trip to the Soviet Union. We are now trying to find a person in the State Department, who [could] make it public that Robert might visit the Soviet Union as a private citizen. I very much wanted him to meet with Chairman Khrushchev. But when the American press created a scandal, we were forced to deny it. Clearly, here we need to arrange all these things more simply,” remarked Kennedy. “Look here, you invited Salinger to Moscow and the Republicans are already attacking Salinger and me.”Saying goodbye after the conversation, he asked me to give his greetings to N. S. Khrushchev in the hopes, as he said smiling “of the possibility of a calmer meeting than in Vienna, where I was more concerned about how to behave in front of a whole pack of journalists.”Then Kennedy asked me how I spent my day in Washington. I answered that Washington is always boring because there is nowhere to go here: there are no theaters, no good concert hall. “But tomorrow you will have a violin concert —I noted—it will be quite interesting to attend.”“Yes,” Kennedy confirmed, “Washington is certainly a capital without theaters. As you know, we plan to build a large cultural center in Washington, but this would require nearly 30 million dollars. Right now my wife and I are occupied with writing letters to various parties to give donations for the construction. But it is going very slowly. People don’t want to part with the money.”[6]“But why wouldn’t you, Mr. President,” I asked Kennedy, “give the money from your own private means? After all your family is very rich, and if you made such a grand gesture you would probably obtain a good many kind words for your own household.”Kennedy smiled and said completely frankly:“Yes, but here we are talking about my own money.”The next morning when I was intending to leave for New York to board my flight for Mexico, [former US ambassador to Moscow and now State Department official W. Averell] Harriman unexpectedly called me and said that he was prepared to go to the Soviet Embassy to see me for a few minutes or, if it was more convenient, asked me to see him. I answered that it would be better if I dropped in on Mr. Harriman. The conversation with Harriman took 15 or 20 minutes and was of a general character. Harriman was concerned with Laos, and reiterated Kennedy’s idea a few times that it would be good to agree about Laos. Then he asked me to send Khrushchev a big hello and said that he remembered the meeting with Nikita Sergeevich and was happy to welcome him at his home.“All our family remembers this visit and remembers that the Chairman carried the conversation lightly and nonchalantly,” Harriman said. “I am an old man but I dream about a new meeting with Khrushchev and am sure we will certainly speak about US-Soviet relations.”Harriman asked permission for several journalists and photographers to come into his office and repeat his greeting for N. S. Khrushchev and to say again in the presence of the press that he would like to meet with N. S. Khrushchev to discuss many important problems. This was all obviously done with the consideration that Harriman’s name would once again appear in print, especially in connection with [the fact] that he is acquainted with and has spoken to N. S. Khrushchev.Adzhubei[1] Ed. Note: An Eisenhower visit to the Soviet Union was planned for the summer of 1960—reciprocating Khrushchev’s visit to the United States in September 1959—but the trip was cancelled after the collapse of the May 1960 East-West summit in Paris as a result of the Soviet downing of a US U-2 reconnaissance plane and Eisenhower’s refusal to apologize for sending it.  [2] Ed. note: Bolshakov, a Soviet military intelligence (GRU) officer at the Soviet Embassy in Washington, had established a cordial liaison to JFK through the president’s brother, Robert F. Kennedy.  The link ruptured later in 1962, at the time of the missile crisis, when US officials concluded that Khrushchev had used him to mislead the Kennedy Administration the secret deployment of nuclear missiles to Cuba, thereby destroying his credibility and ending his usefulness.  His place was, in effect, taken by the Soviet ambassador, Anatoly F. Dobrynin, who met with RFK during the crisis and became a new back-channel conduit between Kennedy and Khrushchev. [3] Ed. note: This refers to the meeting of Organization of American States (OAS) foreign ministers in Punta del Este, Uruguay, from 22-31 January 1962, at which US Secretary of State Dean Rusk pushed for measures to further isolate and sanction Cuba, achieving some limited success.[4] Ed. note: The reference here is to the opposite sides in the Laotian civil war that the United States and the Soviet Union were, respectively, supporting; in a rare sign of agreement, Washington and Moscow were able to reach agreement in Geneva in July 1962 on a pact to neutralize Laos, which failed to end the simmering conflict there but for the most part removed it from the superpower agenda.[5] Ed. note: Amid signs of a Sino-Soviet schism, Kennedy is here making an evident allusion to the People’s Republic of China.[6] Ed. note: A reference to what would become known as the Kennedy Center after its namesake’s assassination.\n"

      "TOP SECRETDuring my visit to Washington, Brazil, and passing through Mexico, I had a few meetings with US President John Kennedy, his brother, Robert Kennedy, and a few other figures from the President’s circle. In Brazil I met with President [João] Goulart, Prime Minister [Tancredo] Neves, Minister of International [Foreign] Affairs [San Tiago] Dantos, and a few other officials. In Mexico I had a short conversation with President [Adolfo] Lopez Mateos. Telegrams were dispatched to Moscow from these countries in which the character of these conversations was reported. I would like to report to the Central Committee a few more details and circumstances about the meetings and conversations which occurred in the USA which will help to complete the picture.Firstly, what surprised American journalists and journalists of other Western nations accredited to Washington was the heightened interest of American society in the very fact, as [columnist Walter] Lippmann expressed it, of the contact between the USA and the USSR on various levels. When I was in the United States this concerned M. Kharlamov’s meeting with [White House press secretary] P[ierre]. Salinger. The newspapers made a lot of noise about the possibility of J. Kennedy making a trip to the USSR. Finally there was talk of the president’s inviting me to breakfast. There were a number of conjectures on this account and many direct questions at the time of the reception at the embassy, at which many notable American journalists were present: Lippmann, [St. Louis Post-Dispatch correspondent Marquis] Childs, [New York Times reporter James] Reston, [New York Herald-Tribune correspondent Marguerite] Higgins, directors of television and radio companies, etc. It was possible to understand from the conversations with these journalists, from the announcements of the services, that in the United States there is now a heightened nervousness and extraordinary interest in taking any step, which could occur in one way or another, that from the point of view of Americans promotes the possibility of reconciling American-Soviet differences. Much has happened to me in America, but I have never seen such agitated anticipation for the improvement of relations between our countries as exists now.Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev said that the hour has come—the American nation is beginning to wake up and Americans are ceasing to be lazy seals that warm themselves on warm shores. It is clear that the time is approaching. In any case, as the most experienced American journalists say frankly, in many respects they can’t figure Americans out. Thus Childs has said about the persecution of the Communist party in the USA: “If it was not for this occurring, it is possible that in the past thousands of Americans, especially the youth, would not have demonstrated a large interest towards Marxism and your ideas. Even now when I [visit] universities, because I am familiar with Russia in a way, they don’t ask me about my travels in other countries but what I think about communism.” When I told Lippmann that there is a very positive atmosphere at the Soviet embassy, he laughed and rejoined:“And how! You’ve signed the German peace treaty, established a border in Berlin, put a gate there, and since you signed the agreement a war hasn’t started, and now everything is settling normally.”I gave the appearance that I did not understand Lippmann, and said to him:“The agreement is still not signed. You are clearly getting ahead of events.”“No, it is you who have gotten ahead of events,” Lippmann remarked, “you understand everything wonderfully, and most importantly, your premier understands this.”At this very moment a few other American journalists approached us, including Childs and Reston. Hearing what was being said, one of them remarked:“I am sure that you will not sign the German peace treaty for a long time yet.”“Why?” I asked.“Because it is very convenient to have a callus on the foot of your neighbor who you don’t particularly like. There is always the possibility in such cases of unintentionally disturbing this callus and doing your neighbor harm, but then [you can] excuse yourself and say that it was an accident.”At the time of the conversation about Germany and the problem of West Berlin it was perceived that the American journalists lacked the level of interest they had only a few months ago.Violating all norms of protocol, a few dozen American journalists and Kennedy advisers stayed at the Soviet embassy until almost midnight. If I were to summarize the conversation that occurred that night it would go something like this. Eisenhower became president of the USA at first because in the eyes of the American people he was considered to be a hero of the Second World War. But the second time, in this very capacity, Eisenhower came forward like a peacemaker in the Korean War. His announcement that if elected he would succeed in achieving a Korean peace practically won him the presidency. Kennedy did not have many of Eisenhower’s advantages with regard to popularity. Kennedy’s administration, and the journalists and newspapers which supported Kennedy, including a number of prominent newspapers like the New York Times, tried to do his political business for him. The newspapers were full of various articles telling the story of the ascent of John Kennedy. They talked about his service in the navy during the war, and there were big advertisements on the occasion of his various appearances and speeches; there was [also] the story about the Kennedy family as being the ideal American family. One of the journalists even said to me as a joke: “We know that the Soviet Union struggles with the cult of personality. It is clear that we have begun our own cult of Kennedy and it may be that at some point we will have to struggle with this cult.”It goes without saying that Kennedy was often worried and was preoccupied with the idea that it would be difficult for him to win the votes [needed] for a second term. Kennedy had already announced his candidacy and his administration was ready to actively cultivate public opinion; of that there could be no doubt. However, Kennedy himself, his brother, and those people closest to him until that time were extremely alarmed that Kennedy had not won the election with a very large advantage over the Republicans. Now they are making every effort to start a new election campaign and gain a firmer position from which to go to the polls against the Republicans more boldly. This circumstance is forcing Kennedy and his closest people to take various measures in connection with all of the following methods. I’ve already spoken about one of these, the Cult of Kennedy. A second is to present the affair in this manner – Kennedy has gathered around himself the most intelligent Americans and that he organized a dynamic administration. Not without obvious pleasure, journalists announced that Kennedy himself and those closest to him openly mocked Eisenhower who was now openly called the Golf President. In connection with this, Reston told me a joke, which as he expressed it, he tried not to tell to foreigners during the reign of Eisenhower: “When Ike planned to go to meet you, the Soviet Union, there were rumors in America that Mister Khrushchev prepared a field to play golf somewhere in Moscow.[1] In that connection we said: “When Ike plays golf in the USA that is only half the trouble. When he wins or loses in America it concerns only us Americans in the end. Premier Khrushchev will surely lose to Eisenhower at golf in the Soviet Union, and along with this victory, the old man will lose to Khrushchev in completely different terms.”This was one extremely important thing for Kennedy and any other future American president. The President of the United States must be able to speak, so they say, with Soviet leaders. In the end, this advantage seemed to be the most important. With good reason, so they say, during agitation at meetings many voices really rallied around Kennedy, saying: “[Eisenhower’s vice president, Richard M.] Nixon cannot talk with Premier Khrushchev, and if he can it is only in the kitchen (in that way, the conversation between Nixon and N. S. Khrushchev in the kitchen of a typical American household during the American exhibition in Moscow [in July 1959] was ironically ridiculed.) Kennedy knows how to speak with Premier Khrushchev.”The Kennedy administration has persistently influenced the American people in the manner described above. Kennedy himself and his circle, however, are worried that he will not be able to prove to Americans in time his ability to make agreements and reconcile the continuous questions about the Soviet Union. When Childs and I said goodbye to one another (Childs and I have been acquainted for a long time. We participated together in the New Year’s discussion in 1959 in Paris), he frankly said: “We came to the Soviet embassy today [and] spent so much time here because we supposed that Kennedy had obviously decided to show that he is seriously beginning a serious dialogue with Khrushchev.” I answered that I could not vouch for Kennedy but that as concerns the Soviet government it is always prepared for serious conversations regarding the resolution of differences. Childs added: “As you know, I sympathize with the Democrats and am worried about Kennedy. He maintains approximately 125,000 reservists in the army. This is 125,000 votes against him, plus their wives, fiancés, mothers, and fathers, that is, around half a million votes. In November 1962, elections will be held for the House of Representatives and one-third of the seats in the Senate. Although in the United States the president can do without a majority in either the Senate or the House, it is better to nevertheless have this majority. In this fashion, the November 1962 elections,” continued Childs, “will be a kind of rehearsal before his re-election campaign, which Kennedy will begin sometime in 1963.”The day after my trip to Washington the president had me over for breakfast [on 30 January 1962], at which his wife, her sister and [Georgi] Bolshakov and his wife were in attendance.[2] This detail drew my attention. When I exchanged greetings with Kennedy he almost immediately directed the conversation towards Cuba and how I liked it there. Receiving a suitable answer, he paused a little and said:“How is Che Guevara?”I answered that he didn’t seem to look bad, although I didn’t see him often, and asked him in turn, why was the president suddenly interested in one of the participants of the Cuban revolution?“I read some dispatches to the press,” answered Kennedy.In turn I remarked: “You are interested in the events in Cuba, that is your right. But when we read that the USA plans to invade Cuba, we don’t think that this is your right.”“We are not planning an invasion of Cuba,” Kennedy answered.I reminded him: “And what of the mercenaries from Guantanamo and those other countries? You already changed your opinion regarding the landing in April 1961, that it was a mistake for America?”Kennedy hit his fist on the table and said:“Once I summoned [then CIA director] Allen Dulles and rebuked him. I said to him: ‘learn from the Russians. When they had a tough situation in Hungary [in 1956], they put an end to the conflict in just three days. When they didn’t like the events in Finland, the president of that country went to meet with the Soviet premier in Siberia, and everything was worked out. And you, Dulles, couldn’t do a thing.’”I answered the President:“With regard to Hungary, your analogy with Cuba is entirely untenable. With regard to Finland, well maybe this is the case, which should make the United States aware that they need to learn to respect Cuba. After all, we respect Finland. Even though Capitalist elements exist within it, the president of a bourgeois government retains good relations with the Soviet Union.”Kennedy became quiet, and then with earnestness said:“From a psychological point of view, it is very hard for the American people to agree with what is going on in Cuba. After all it is only 90 miles from our coast. It is very hard,” he repeated, and then added, “Cuba fell from within.”“It is necessary to become reconciled with a great many things,” I remarked to the President. “And there are a great many things to become accustomed to, and it is clear that there are a great number of new things that the American people must get used to. Only do not meddle in events in Cuba, this is most important. But your people understand this.”Kennedy remarked sharply:“We will not meddle with events in Cuba.”“It’s a very big shame, Mister President,” I said to him, “that your words are not allowed to be published in the newspapers.”Kennedy asked the question: “How would Castro react to the fact that you were invited to Washington from Havana?”I said that Castro was very happy about this, he has an appreciation for peaceful coexistence which would include an improvement in US relations.“We can talk more about this after breakfast, if you permit it.”Then, as I have already written, Kennedy sent Salinger and [US interpreter Alexander A.] Akalovsky away, and asked Bolshakov to be the interpreter. The conversation continued for almost two hours. The content of the conversation has already been announced from Washington.In the course of the conversation, Kennedy said that he was going to a press conference the following day, one which was usually held at the State Department. At the press conference there were more than 400 journalists present. There was a heightened sense of interest towards it. Although this conference occurred immediately after the completion of the conference in Punta-del-Este, Kennedy was, however, literally tongue-tied and uttered only a few words about the inter-American conference.[3]He was not asked one question in connection with this conference. In the corridors American journalists asked: “What is there to ask the president, when the United States has failed? Brazil, Mexico and other nations gave us a slap in the face.”There was one question asked which frustrated Kennedy. One of the journalists asked: “In connection with the conclusion of the conference at Punta-del-Este, did the United States return to normal trade relations with Cuba, or will it still not be possible to buy cigars there?” In a malcontented tone, [Kennedy responded] “I am not involved in the proceedings of that event. It seems that there is some talk about the sale of some medical supplies. Maybe we will receive cigars in return.” And that prompted an explosion of laughter in the hall.A few questions about Soviet-American relations were asked, which included one question about whether Kennedy is planning to visit the Soviet Union and whether or not he has some kind of invitation to do so. Kennedy was troubled by this question, and was feeling particularly clumsy because of the presence of Soviet journalists. His answer was evasive, meaning approximately that he would like to [visit the Soviet Union], but he was not invited.At that time the theme of Kennedy traveling to the Soviet Union and meeting with N. S. Khrushchev appeared continuously in American newspapers. Americans with whom I have had the opportunity to speak ask this question if they are in some way interested in political questions.I would also like to point out one more fact in connection with Kennedy’s press conference. He was asked many empty, overtly demagogic questions on third-rate problems. This created the impression that this “waste of time” is a very “American tradition” created by the imperial propaganda machine for the befuddlement of the people.After the press conference, Kennedy asked about one more meeting, which as he expressed it would be of a strictly confidential character. This has already been reported to Moscow.Mind you, the president has a fear of being simple and open before Soviet journalists. Through Bolshakov, Salinger agreed that at 6:00 that evening he would send a car for me from the White House, in which I would ride around the city so that journalists would not discover the president’s new meeting with a Soviet editor. And sure enough, the car carried us down some long streets, and at last we arrived at the White House at the president’s private entrance. The gate opened quickly, we were asked for no documents, and the car went immediately through the entrance.Kennedy was waiting and walking around the corridor. He immediately came into the room and in a nervous tone began the conversation. Gesticulating, he said: “Your armies are in Europe. I know the strength and potential of your military machine. Khrushchev can, of course”—and Kennedy made a gesture with his hands—“can take West Berlin. But then this would possibly provoke a rupture of relations between the Western nations and your nation and lead to tension.”“I want to emphasize to you again with all seriousness that it is my plan to find some [mutually] beneficial solution to this problem, which does not encroach on the positions that you cannot give up, as well as those positions, from which we cannot retreat. I ask you to report, and if possible, to do it [only] orally, that the US, England, and France are opposed to German reunification. Such a dynamic and powerful state would be a cause of concern for us. We realize that unification is unrealistic; however, [publicly] I must speak about unification. And because of this there could be no talk about recognizing the GDR [German Democratic Republic; East Germany], and nor the border on the Elbe [i.e. the border between the two Germanys]. With respect to other border questions, it is completely possible that steps intended to regulate our disputes will lead to an announcement of the recognition of borders on the Oder and Neisse.”Kennedy very insistently, as in the first conversation, harped on the idea that in the next several years it will be necessary to work out some mutually-agreeable relations that will lead to some softening of the general world situation and permit, as he expressed it, a more composed perspective from which to observe the state of affairs in the world. In connection with this he said that in Laos he will “tie Boun Oum’s arms” if for our part we guarantee him the Pathet Lao’s equanimity.[4]Kennedy is clearly worried about the situation in Southeast Asia and particularly, of course, in South Vietnam. He did not answer any questions about South Vietnam and the position of the United States in South Korea and did not want to continue the conversation on this theme, uttering the general phrase that neither the USSR nor the USA had any major interests in that region and we have to keep this in mind before all other things. He once again repeated the idea previously addressed that the United States of America and the Soviet Union send many weapons there, but these weapons and these complications can be used by a third power more interested in a conflict between the USA and the USSR.[5]Then Kennedy long-windedly talked about how he emphasized with utmost urgency the Berlin problem. Continuing the previous conversation, he said that he would like a more constructive and, as he stated it more precisely, a more personal dialogue between [Soviet Foreign] Minister [Andrei] Gromyko and [US Ambassador in Moscow Llewellyn E.] Thompson insofar as they now only exchange general declarations. “We would like,” Kennedy said, “for them to sit at a table, have in their hands the map of Germany and begin to look for possibilities for a settlement, which would be equally agreeable to the Soviet Union and the United States of America. I want your government to understand: it is impossible for us to leave West Berlin or to permit a Soviet military presence there.” In connection with my question, Why can’t the question of a guarantee come from the United Nations or the neutral nations[?], he said that this is also not possible, that it would lead to the total collapse of the Western Bloc. “You understand,” he began to say in a concerned way, “the more complex our relations become in Berlin and Germany, the more insistent [West German Chancellor Konrad] Adenauer becomes. For the time being I am restraining him and have sufficient arguments for not giving him atomic weapons. However, these high-level complications that are arising between us are prompting retaliatory forces in West Berlin.” Kennedy was obviously calculating that this phrase on some level would, if not frighten us per se, intimidate us.Kennedy answered: “It is not that we are afraid of West Germany and the president understands this perfectly.” Maybe this is a delicate question – I asked Kennedy whether the United States was afraid of West Germany, or still more whether England and France were afraid of West Germany.“It is possible to be afraid of the Germans,” Kennedy answered. Then he said: “I understand that you and your allies can’t use the words ‘occupation force.’ But with regard to a small contingent of soldiers, it would be possible to find a different name. Now about the access,” Kennedy continued. “I see things realistically. Insofar as you object to international control of the highway [between West Berlin and West Germany], it is senseless for us to insist on it. After all the officers of the GDR are already (I thanked the president for pronouncing the full name, the German Democratic Republic, before me for the first time) putting their stamps [in documents]. The important thing is not who is affixing the stamps. Could you and I fantasize a bit (this is exactly what he said) about some compromise steps regarding Western powers’ access to West Berlin? We are ready to meet the Soviet Union halfway and we will not have political ties with the FRG [Federal Republic of Germany; West Germany]. Maybe you too could meet us halfway in terms of some softening on the Western positions in the issue of access.Then the president developed this idea: the situation could arise that the Soviet fleet was carried by storm into the waters of [Francisco] Franco’s Spain. “In such a case you would not be able to make contact with Franco, but would you not ask that a third power somehow intercede on your behalf?”“We already tried to do this, when the question arose about the Soviet tanker Tuapse, which was seized in a bandit fashion by your friend Chiang Kai Shek [Jiang Jieshi] and nothing came of out it.”“Let’s not talk about the past,” the president said. “We also have friends we don’t like. So, if an American caravan of freight cars gets into a conflict on a highway, we cannot – and don’t not try forcing us to do —do it – beginning a dialogue with [GDR leader Walter] Ulbricht. It would clearly mean being pulled into recognizing the GDR. To whom would we turn in such a case to deescalate, to untie this crisis?”I answered that if it was defined by this simple analogy, it was obvious [that the US would turn] to some sort of third power.Kennedy said: “Now maybe it will be worthwhile to fantasize around this.” Once again he emphasized: “We understand we cannot win international control, and of course it is foolish to cling to that which will not be put in writing.”Then Kennedy spoke about how they worked out with [British Prime Minister Harold] Macmillan a new pretext for disarmament, which he considers would meet with a constructive response from the Soviet government side.(One can imagine how stunned Kennedy was when he heard about our plan to convene the Eighteen Nation Disarmament Committee at the highest level. This undoubtedly struck out Kennedy and Macmillan’s hopes to [have the] initiative.) Then Kennedy said that he personally welcomes the contact which existed between Bolshakov and Robert Kennedy, insofar as it gives him the possibility to manage without the services of a translator from the State Department. These observations show that surely in the presence of Akolovsky and even Salinger – a person closer to him the president speaks with a completely different tongue and is visibly more tense.He asked: “Was your conversation with Robert Kennedy after breakfast interesting?”I answered that his brother was quiet and said almost nothing about international problems. Then I matter-of-factly asked the president:“I recently saw in Life magazine a big portrait of your brother, Robert Kennedy, below which was a passage: ‘The number 2 man. The hard-line, unrelenting, younger brother.’ Is this accurate that Robert Kennedy has become the #2 man in the USA?”Kennedy was surprised:“Even you turned your attention to this? I spoke with my brother on this subject and said to him that if he is planning to become No. 1 this would not be so easy for him, and that he would sooner become No. 3, No. 4, No. 5, No. 6.”“By the way – remarked Kennedy – there was quite a scandal with regard to [my] brother’s [proposed] trip to the Soviet Union. We are now trying to find a person in the State Department, who [could] make it public that Robert might visit the Soviet Union as a private citizen. I very much wanted him to meet with Chairman Khrushchev. But when the American press created a scandal, we were forced to deny it. Clearly, here we need to arrange all these things more simply,” remarked Kennedy. “Look here, you invited Salinger to Moscow and the Republicans are already attacking Salinger and me.”Saying goodbye after the conversation, he asked me to give his greetings to N. S. Khrushchev in the hopes, as he said smiling “of the possibility of a calmer meeting than in Vienna, where I was more concerned about how to behave in front of a whole pack of journalists.”Then Kennedy asked me how I spent my day in Washington. I answered that Washington is always boring because there is nowhere to go here: there are no theaters, no good concert hall. “But tomorrow you will have a violin concert —I noted—it will be quite interesting to attend.”“Yes,” Kennedy confirmed, “Washington is certainly a capital without theaters. As you know, we plan to build a large cultural center in Washington, but this would require nearly 30 million dollars. Right now my wife and I are occupied with writing letters to various parties to give donations for the construction. But it is going very slowly. People don’t want to part with the money.”[6]“But why wouldn’t you, Mr. President,” I asked Kennedy, “give the money from your own private means? After all your family is very rich, and if you made such a grand gesture you would probably obtain a good many kind words for your own household.”Kennedy smiled and said completely frankly:“Yes, but here we are talking about my own money.”The next morning when I was intending to leave for New York to board my flight for Mexico, [former US ambassador to Moscow and now State Department official W. Averell] Harriman unexpectedly called me and said that he was prepared to go to the Soviet Embassy to see me for a few minutes or, if it was more convenient, asked me to see him. I answered that it would be better if I dropped in on Mr. Harriman. The conversation with Harriman took 15 or 20 minutes and was of a general character. Harriman was concerned with Laos, and reiterated Kennedy’s idea a few times that it would be good to agree about Laos. Then he asked me to send Khrushchev a big hello and said that he remembered the meeting with Nikita Sergeevich and was happy to welcome him at his home.“All our family remembers this visit and remembers that the Chairman carried the conversation lightly and nonchalantly,” Harriman said. “I am an old man but I dream about a new meeting with Khrushchev and am sure we will certainly speak about US-Soviet relations.”Harriman asked permission for several journalists and photographers to come into his office and repeat his greeting for N. S. Khrushchev and to say again in the presence of the press that he would like to meet with N. S. Khrushchev to discuss many important problems. This was all obviously done with the consideration that Harriman’s name would once again appear in print, especially in connection with [the fact] that he is acquainted with and has spoken to N. S. Khrushchev.Adzhubei[1] Ed. Note: An Eisenhower visit to the Soviet Union was planned for the summer of 1960—reciprocating Khrushchev’s visit to the United States in September 1959—but the trip was cancelled after the collapse of the May 1960 East-West summit in Paris as a result of the Soviet downing of a US U-2 reconnaissance plane and Eisenhower’s refusal to apologize for sending it.  [2] Ed. note: Bolshakov, a Soviet military intelligence (GRU) officer at the Soviet Embassy in Washington, had established a cordial liaison to JFK through the president’s brother, Robert F. Kennedy.  The link ruptured later in 1962, at the time of the missile crisis, when US officials concluded that Khrushchev had used him to mislead the Kennedy Administration the secret deployment of nuclear missiles to Cuba, thereby destroying his credibility and ending his usefulness.  His place was, in effect, taken by the Soviet ambassador, Anatoly F. Dobrynin, who met with RFK during the crisis and became a new back-channel conduit between Kennedy and Khrushchev. [3] Ed. note: This refers to the meeting of Organization of American States (OAS) foreign ministers in Punta del Este, Uruguay, from 22-31 January 1962, at which US Secretary of State Dean Rusk pushed for measures to further isolate and sanction Cuba, achieving some limited success.[4] Ed. note: The reference here is to the opposite sides in the Laotian civil war that the United States and the Soviet Union were, respectively, supporting; in a rare sign of agreement, Washington and Moscow were able to reach agreement in Geneva in July 1962 on a pact to neutralize Laos, which failed to end the simmering conflict there but for the most part removed it from the superpower agenda.[5] Ed. note: Amid signs of a Sino-Soviet schism, Kennedy is here making an evident allusion to the People’s Republic of China.[6] Ed. note: A reference to what would become known as the Kennedy Center after its namesake’s assassination.\n",

North Korea’s Ambassador [Hyeon Jun-geuk (Hyun Jun Guk)] requested a meeting today and informed [me] of the following:The North Korean Embassy in Beijing was just informed of the events in Oslo. He wished to inform the embassy of his views, and asked for consultations and cooperation on the issue. He opened by stating that because of my function as Ambassador to North Korea, it was natural to consult me. He was aware of the decision by the Norwegian Government to order the diplomats to leave the country as a result of their illegal activities. This was entirely new information to the Ambassador, and he expressed doubts about the validity of the claims. He then said that the wish to improve the relationship between our two countries was the reason why North Korea had established diplomatic relations with Norway in the first place. In accordance with the policies of North Korea, they had worked hard to ensure good relations with Norway. Their embassy in Oslo had displayed utmost respect for Norwegian law, and carried out their work within Norwegian legal boundaries. He could hardly believe that members of North Korea’s Embassy had been engaged in illegal activities. Despite the improbable nature of the issue, Norwegian authorities had taken unilateral action and ordered the North Korean embassy personnel to leave the country without consulting North Korean authorities. This was most regrettable to the North Koreans.He went on to say that the North Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs would take measures to clarify whether or not the diplomats had been involved in illegal activities. If this turned out to be the case, it would constitute a violation of government policy, and the involved staff would be punished.He again expressed his regrets that the Norwegian government had taken the unexpected step to expel the embassy personnel without consultation or negotiation with the North Korean government without considering how this may be detrimental to relations between the two countries. He hoped our two countries could resolve the issue so as to prevent a deterioration of our good relationship as a result of this issue. The Ambassador went on to suggest that if the claims of illegal activities turns out to be true, it may very well be that individuals acting against the will of the North Korean government are to blame. Finally, he expressed hopes that a negotiated settlement of the issue may be reached.I referred to the contents of 84 dated 18.10.76 and made clear that because Norwegian police had decided to take action it was highly unlikely that it did not have incriminating evidence. Furthermore, I told him that I could not engage in neither consultations or negotiations relating to the issue without orders from Oslo, but I promised to inform the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs of his request.Finally, I informed him that he would be notified promptly if such an order was issued from Oslo.[Ambassador Torleiv] Anda-----I am scheduled to travel to Canton [Guangzhou] tomorrow, 22. October, at 9pm local time. I may stay in Beijing if necessary. Please advise on this per telex. [Torleiv] Anda\n",

      "전보문발신자: 모스크바분류: 기밀일자: 1975년 5월 1925일제050.572호조선의 통일 가능성과 관련하여, [1975년] 5월 19일 회담에서 조선민주주의인민공화국 대사 권희경은 미국과 박정희 일당 간의 약속으로 인해 남조선에 미군이 주둔하게 된 것을 장애물로 강조하였다. 우리의 소식통이 말하기를, 이러한 상황에서 조선민주주의인민공화국은 유엔과 기타 국제기구 및 양자관계 전략에서 미국이 그들의 군대를 남조선에서 철수시키도록 투쟁하는 노력을 강화할 것이라고 언급했다. 권희경 대사는 조국의 통일을 추구하고 이의 성취를 위해 조선민주주의인민공화국의 지도층이 [다음의] 세가지 방안을 모색하고 있다고 한다:ㄱ. 평화적 방안. 이 접근법은 잘 알려진 북조선 정부의 제안 등으로부터 계속하여 추구되었다. 그러나 통일의 반대세력인 박정희가 남조선 권력의 중심에 존재하는 한, 인민들의 의지는 충족되지 못할 것이다. 이 평화적 방안은 서울에서 민주주의 정부가 권력을 되찾을 때에야 만 성공할 수 있을 것이다. ㄴ. 군사적 방안. 미국의 지원을 받은 남조선 군대와 조선민주주의인민공화국 군대와의 빈번한 마찰과 양 측이 단지 휴전협정만을 체결했음을 감안한다면, 군사적 충돌이 발생하는 것은 언제라도 가능하다. 그러나 이런 경우 조선민주주의인민공화국에 그 책임이 물어질 것이다. [북조선] 대사는 비무장지대 양쪽에 군력과 무기가 대단히 많이 비축되어 있음을 지적했다. 양측간에는 포격이 빈번이 발생하기도 한다. 자동식 무기로 포격이 가해질 때는 북조선군 또한 자동식 무기로 반격하며, 다른 종류의 무기를 사용한 공격에도 마찬가지이다. 반면 남조선측은 다음과 같은 방법으로 북측에 반격한다: 기계식총에는 자동식 무기로, 기계식총에 지뢰로, 지뢰에는 대포로 대응한다.만약 양측 사이에 전쟁이 일어난다면 조선민주주의인민공화국은 이러한 [군사적] 방법으로 조국의 통일을 이룩할 준비가 되어있다. 그러나 이것으로 전쟁을 시작하지는 않을 것이다. 조선민주주의인민공화국은 미국 또한 그들이 베트남에서 얻은 “경험”에 비추어, 전쟁을 원치 않는다고 믿고 있다. ㄷ. 반동적 방안. 남조선에서, 반란 또는 대규모 반동활동을 초래하여 민주적인 정부의 정권 찬탈을 가져올 수 있는 반동적 기운이 강화되고 있다. 이러한 민주적인 정부는 조선민주주의인민공화국에 북측과 남측을 통일하는 데에 도움을 요청할 수도 있다. 이러한 시나리오 하에서, 조선민주주의인민공화국은 긍정적으로 반응할 것이다. 권희경 대사의 말에 따르면, 이러한 시나리오 하에서 해방절차와 그 후에 이루어질 국가통일은 베트남에서보다 훨씬 빠르게 전개될 수도 있다고 한다. 북조선 대사는 북조선 지도층이 이러한 세가지 방안에 밀접히 관련된 세가지 과제를 다음과 같이 결정했다고 한다:ㄱ. 조선 북측 부분에서의 강력하고 급격한 사회주의의 건설.ㄴ. 남조선에서의 반동 및 민주화 운동의 지지 및 추구.ㄷ. 세계의 모든 반동적 세력과 민주적 우방국과의 군사적 관계 강화를 통해, 위의 세가지 시나리오 모두에서 조선민주주의인민공화국이 국가통일에 지원을 얻을 수 있도록 함.서명: Gheorghe Badrus\n",

He was accompanied by the minister of education, the deputy foreign minister, and the deputy foreign trade minister.The North Korean Vice-President was received by the Shah. [The North Korean official] transmitted a message from President Kim Il Sung and had a conversation with the Shah. No joint communique was released; no documents were signed.According to the North Korean diplomats, the aim of the visit was to refresh North Korea’s friendly relations with Iran, and, at the same time, to counter-balance South Korea’s efforts in this country.Before arriving in Iran, the delegation made official visits to Nigeria, Togo, Benin and Zaire. In Zaire, the delegation witnessed the events [we have already mentioned to you].Note: South Korea is very active in Iran, both in terms of economic and political relations. About 5000 South Korean qualified workers and technicians were hired in Iran and they work in various economic facilities: building harbors, drivers on trucks etc. The two countries agreed to cooperate in the field of fishing, food canning, agriculture, etc.From the information we have, construction work on a refinery in Seoul, with a capacity of 60,000 barrels/day has started; the raw materials for this [refinery] will be provided by Iran for a 15-year period. Last year, the South Korean Prime Minister, Choe Gyu-ha, paid an official visit to Iran.Meanwhile, North Korea’s trade with Iran is almost equal to zero; North Korea’s presence in Iran is not felt in any way. Iran is striving to maintain the appearance of a balance in its relations with the two Koreas, but its sympathy is obviously tilted towards South Korea.SignedAgop Bezerian\n",

The situation in the Korean Peninsula remains possibly the most explosive one in Asia, with real possibilities to get the big powers involved in the eventuality of a conflict breaking out. 2. Lately the political tensions in South Korea are rising. The intensification of anti-government demonstrations contributes to maintain this state of tension and the possibility to have the South Korean administration lose control over the situation, which would bring about an even tougher attitude towards the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, descending into an armed conflict. In addition to the fact that Seoul has a better economic situation, a better trained and better equipped army (the rapport would be 2 to 1 compared to the North Korean army), South Korea is amongst those countries which are capable of producing nuclear weapons, with all the restrictions and preventive measures imposed by the United States of America. All these could compel the Seoul authorities to undertake a military venture.3. Judging from the data of the Department of State, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea asked for a postponement of its foreign debt repayment, which indicates a bad economic situation. That, combined with an inaccurate understanding of the situation in South Korea (where anti-government demonstrations could be interpreted as a sign of the administration’s weakness), could be a reason to accelerate [North Korea’s] attacks on South Korea.4. The Department of State believes that action must be taken with respect to both states to make them abstain from measures or actions which would lead to an increase in the tension on the Korean Peninsula. Therefore, they believe that if the Korean matter cannot be taken off the agenda of the UN General Assembly session, debates should in any case be limited to realities, and sensitive areas which may trigger undesired effects should not be exacerbated.Signed: Corneliu Bogdan\n",

The Japanese delegation, comprising 6 ministers, was led by Sunao Sonoda – the Minister of Foreign Affairs. The main point of the discussions was the peace treaty signed between Japan and People’s Republic of China, about which the South Koreans, led by the Minister of Foreign affairs Pak Dong-jin, expressed its concern regarding the possible influences over the situation on the Korean peninsula. Moreover, in this context, the Japanese minister Sonoda assured that signing the treaty with the People’s Republic of China will not change Japan’s position on the Korean question, but it will contribute to the stability in Asia. At the same time, he hinted that the perspective of establishing relations between Japan with the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is in the attention of the Japanese government. During a meeting of the committee for foreign affairs of the House of Representatives, one week ago Sonoda declared that the issue of relations with the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea can no longer be ignored. The ministerial reunion has not brought anything new to the issues of reducing the deficit in the balance of trade with South Korea which currently amounts to 3 billion US dollars. Moreover, the Takeshima island matter was not mentioned, both sides being aware that there is no mutually convenient solution for the time being. A new element in the current relations between the two countries was the proposal of the Japanese Prime Minister, Takeo Fukuda, transmitted to the minister of foreign affairs S. Sonoda, to meet with the president of South Korea, Park Chung Hee. The proposal was accepted, and the date is going to be decided by the [two ministries of foreign affairs]. It is worth mentioning that the last meeting of this kind took place in 1967 when the Japanese ex-prime-minister, Saku Sato, visited Seoul.Even though a concrete outcome on bilateral relations was not reached, the Ministerial Conference was considered a success by the Japanese because the South Korean officials expressed their interest regarding the treaty signed by Japan with the People’s Republic of China.

Relations are carried on the basis of direct ties, established between different institutions of the two countries, in the economic and cultural domains, as well as at the level of mass organizations.The Korean ambassador added that it could be noticed that the attitude of the Japanese government is more flexible about granting Korean residents the right to visit their relatives in Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. Regarding the matter of establishing diplomatic relations, the Korean ambassador said that the Japanese government continues to maintain its known position of conditioning the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and Japan on similar steps undertaken by other socialist countries to establish diplomatic relations with South Korea. This wish basically represents the wish to maintain the separation of Korea, and represents the concept of the existence of two Koreas, which is unacceptable.Japan also aims, and is being encouraged, to take the place of the American forces in case they are gradually withdrawn from South Korea. There are some cues in this sense, such as the participation of the Japanese armed forces, the so called defense forces, in joint American-South Korean-Japanese military drills.The Korean ambassador added that their concern about the unification of Korea is incessant. In the speech offered by Comrade Kim Il Sung on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the proclamation of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, new proposals were made regarding the withdrawal of the US forces from South Korea, cutting the support offered to the Park Chung Hee’s faction, which would allow the internal democratic forces to achieve the national desideratum, the unification of the country. Such conditions would offer an opportunity to negotiate not only with Japan but also with United States.SignedVictor Bolojan\n",

On the occasion of his arrival, the minister of foreign affairs informed him that, basically, the Cypriot government agreed to establish diplomatic relations with the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.However, before the decision is adopted some formalities that require 2-3 months must be met. The Cypriot minister promised that he would discuss this problem again with his Korean counterpart, on the occasion of the Conference of the Non-Aligned Movement in Belgrade, after which he hoped that diplomatic relations would have been established between the two countries.The Cypriot minister of foreign affairs informed the Korean diplomat that the government of South Korea had proposed to establish diplomatic relations with Cyprus four times in the last years but the proposals had been refused by the government of Cyprus. Counselor Han [sic] said that the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s Embassy in Cairo talked to the Moroccan authorities about the problem of establishing diplomatic relations between the two countries, and the Moroccan government agreed to establish diplomatic relations with Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.The relations between Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and Egypt have been developing well in the last years, in all fields of activity; however the Egyptian government is allowing the development of relations with South Korea, including at the political level. Recently, the president of the South Korean parliament made an official visit in Cairo, even though in the discussions [I have had] with officials at the People’s Assembly, it was denied that such visit could take place in Egypt.After the visit, the Egyptian officials did not want to inform the North Korean diplomats about the problems that were discussed with the president of the South Korean government, however, it is not likely that the Egyptian government intends to establish diplomatic relations with South Korea.SignedPetre Burlacu\n",

In the past month and a half, provocations along the DMZ intensified and a large volume of military equipment and weapons were concentrated in the area.As usual, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea government showed a maximum of patience and calm, but the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is ready to face any situation imaginable.The North Korean ambassador made a point out of underlining that Romania supported and continues to support, with all the means available, the just cause of the Korean people, its aspiration for reunification, but the same thing cannot be said of other socialist countries.Signed: Virgil Cazacu\n",

      "Top Secret[To] Ambassador Wang Bingnan:1. Summary account on the 2nd meeting on 2 August received.Our act of releasing eleven US spies before their sentence times expired has aroused broad responses among Asian countries, making the US position more passive. The US does not have many cards in its hand. As expected, the US seized the opportunity to ask us to release more civilians and plans to raise the issue of 500 missing US servicemen from the Korean War. Nonetheless, in his talk with journalists on 2 August, Dulles had to leave the door open for even higher-level talks. This demonstrates how hard the pressure [on the US] is from various sides. As to our policy, we decided in our cabled instructions on 31 July: only after the first agenda has achieved a certain result can we approve the exit and release of civilians. At present, our target of struggle is to win US concessions on the return of our nationals and students. The focus of this issue is to have India take care of the affairs of our nationals and students. In view of the inaccurate information at hand, it may be passive for us to propose a list of names. The best way to deal with this is to propose a total number (about 400 people) and some typical cases of the detained students. As to the other party’s complaints against us, you may give him a dose of his own medicine. Should the other party hand over a list of missing US military personnel, we may tell them honestly that these are old accounts which will not aid in settling issues. We have the issue of more than 14,000 Chinese People’s Volunteers who were captured. These people have actually been detained. We are not afraid of discussing this issue, but we think this kind of discussion will not aid in the settlement of current matters.At the meeting on the 2nd [of August], the other party spoke first. Our speeches addressed their issues. On the contrary, the other party failed to respond to our questions. Thus, at the meeting on the 4th [of August], we may invite the other party to speak first. If the other party declines to speak first, we may speak about the so-called issue of ill-feeling and ask the other party to state its attitude about our four proposals. Attached is an outline on the issue of “ill-feeling” and live examples of our students being prevented from returning for your proper use at the meeting.2. Telegraph dated 12:00 noon, 3 August received. Agree to your evaluation and manner of handling it. When reprimanding the other party as unreasonable for demanding the release of all US nationals, be careful. [It might appear as though] we are not going to release one more or everyone in any case. We should stress the importance of the efforts on both sides. As for the other party’s claim that there is no longer [a] hindrance for [Chinese] students to leave the US, and there is no need to entrust a third party, we should point out that we know there are many students who are willing to return. They dare not express their wishes, however, under various pressures. They may also be forced to change their minds after expressing their wishes to return. Many of them have financial difficulties. Thus, only after entrusting a satisfactory third party to look after their affairs could this matter be handled reasonably.Foreign Ministry3:30 a.m., 3 August\n",

      "Top Secret[To] Comrade [Wang] Bingnan:[…][We] agree to your telegram of 3:00 p.m., 8 August, regarding the US willingness to reach an agreement and resolve some concrete issues.Western journalists have published many speculative reports about the Sino-American talks. The US Army fabricated stories about how we mistreated eleven US fliers and the US and [South Korean President Syngman] Rhee intentionally created tension over the Korean issue. But people all over the world, including American people, demanded results from the Sino-American talks. This puts pressure on the US, who has been forced to reach some agreements [with us] during the talk. The US has consented that India may investigate and aid in the return of Chinese nationals. This is a sign that the US is preparing to sign an agreement with us. If the US walks one step further, agreeing to provide a complete list of Chinese nationals in the US and agrees that India looks after Chinese nationals in the US, it is equal to the recognition of the People’s Republic of China. This is unlikely at present. In addition to offering an explanation to our proposal IV, as to proposal II, the US side also repeatedly claims to have lifted restrictions on the return of Chinese nationals, which applies to Qian Xuesen. Regarding proposal III, the US side also re-supplied a list of seventy-six Chinese students. Thus, we have nearly achieved our goals regarding our four proposals. Yesterday, we proposed to delay the fifth meeting for a day. This is because we need sufficient time in order to telegraph to you the text of the speech. [We hope] that an agreement will be reached on Agenda I on 11 August.The following items should be included in a possible agreement of 11 August.1. Both sides declare that nationals residing in the other’s countries, who desire to return, are entitled to depart [for their respective country] unless they have unfinished civil or criminal cases.2. To implement the aforementioned agreement, China entrusts India and the US entrusts the UK to aid their nationals in the other country on the issue of returning to their respective countries. The countries thus entrusted shall perform the following duties:(a) Upon the request of a civilian of one side residing in the other’s country who desires to return or upon the request of his government made on his behalf, the entrusted country shall make representations with the government of the country in which the civilian is residing with a view to settling his difficulty in departure;(b) In the event of a civilian of one side residing in the other who desires to return and who is being prevented from doing so, the entrusted country shall, upon his personal request or the request on his behalf by his government, conduct investigations and make representations with the government of the country in which the civilian concerned is residing, in accordance with the findings of the investigation with a view of arriving at a settlement;(c) In the event that a civilian of one side residing in the other desires to return and finds difficulty in paying for the return journey, the entrusted country shall render him assistance on behalf of his government.3. Upon the acceptance of the trusteeship described above by India and the UK in response to the requests of China and the US respectively, both sides shall give wide publicity to the details of this agreement by means of all available news media. India and the UK may also give similar publicity which they consider appropriate on the US and China respectively (This doesn’t exclude the publication of the complete text after today’s meeting).We’ll send to you the formal text of this agreement in another telegram.Before proposing this draft agreement on 11 August, [you should] make a speech, pointing out that the US has repeatedly promised the elimination of restrictions in accordance with our second proposal. The US also re-supplied a list of seventy-six Chinese students in accordance with our third proposal. We are satisfied with the arrangements. We have provided a complete list of all US nationals in China. But the US has not provided a list of all Chinese nationals in accordance with our first proposal. We express regret over that matter and declare to reserve our right to put forward this demand in the future (we would raise this matter again if the US bothers us on Agenda II issues).We should also point out that we are not satisfied with the US excuse of prolonged deliberation of our fourth proposal. But for the purpose of reaching an agreement on Agenda I, on the whole, we agree to US arrangements. We propose this draft agreement based on the positions of both sides presented in previous talks. At the end of your speech, you may say that once the draft agreement is reached, we should notify the US side of our decision on those US nationals who have applied to leave China.We will send to you the text of the speech in another telegram.Should the other party agree basically to our proposed draft agreement (You can make a decision without further instructions from the FM if the other party only asks for cosmetic revisions). At that point, you can notify the other party that you have received orders to notify the US side that nine US nationals who applied for departure have been approved to leave. If the other party delays in responding to our draft agreement, then don’t notify them of the granting of departure for nine US nationals (Don’t announce the three convicted US nationals mentioned in the previous plan and the one expelled from China for now). It is likely that the US side might propose a name list of about 470 American POWs and ask us to find out their whereabouts. We should reject such a name list. You may propose that if the other party agrees to transmit our demand to the US government and provide us with a complete list of Chinese nationals in the United States, we will accept a list of American POWs and transmit it to the Korean Military Ceasefire Commission. Otherwise, [you should] decline to accept it.   Foreign Ministry10 August 1955\n",

      "Vice Ministers Zhang [Hanfu] and Huang [Hua], after reading and verifying, send to the Foreign Office for approval (Zhang and Huang have read the document)Han Nianlong23 March [1962]On March 5, [North] Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs Pak Seong-cheol [Pak Song Chol] met with [Chinese] Ambassador Hao Deqing and discussed the issue of ethnic Koreans crossing the border into [North Korea]. He [Pak] said those who crossed the border into [North] Korea are unwilling to return [to China], and therefore the [North] Korean side could only work on settling [the immigrants]. However, most of them cannot settle down and work because they still have family [in China] who could not come to [North] Korea or because they still have property left in China. He [Pak] said there are more and more people crossing the border, and deaths have occurred [in the process]. [This trend] is having a negative political influence and is also affecting social order in [North] Korea. Lastly, Pak proposed that the two governments conduct negotiations in order for Koreans to come and go [between China and Korea] legally. He even accused our country of not properly implementing the relevant bilateral agreement concerning the movement of people [between China and Korea], stating that [North] Korea had issued many “authorization letters” but that [China] approves very few people to actually go to [North] Korea.Before this, the Chief of the [North] Korean Foreign Affairs Consular Bureau twice requested that the Chinese Embassy assist in reuniting some [North] Korean leaders and cadres with 35 family members in China (Chinese nationals) wanting to go to Korea. Through our arrangements, most of them have traveled to [North] Korea, but some of them have not yet left. The [North] Korean side has expressed some dissatisfaction with our sluggish handling of [this issue].Regarding this issue, [Chinese] Comrade Ma Lie orally informed the Premier [Zhou Enlai] of the instruction that if our side has made mistakes, then we should admit to our mistakes and apologize to the [North] Korean side.According to our initial understanding, the situation of ethnic Koreans crossing the border to [North] Korea is particularly severe in Jilin Province. According to the report of the Jilin Provincial Public Security Department, last year our border defense guards discovered 28,028 people crossing the border. Of these, 7,939 people were convinced to return [to China]; there were also 7,528 people who returned [to China] on their own initiative after they went to [North] Korea. The [North] Korean side also sent back 2,361 people, but presently there are still 7,034 people in [North] Korea. In January of this year, 2,323 people crossed the border, which is basically the same as last year. Within one year, we found 243 corpses in the Yalu River and the Tumen River; of these, 82 corpses are Chinese nationals, 11 corpses are [North] Korean nationals, and 150 corpses are still unidentified. In Liaoning Province, a total of 8,237 people crossed the border to [North] Korea from January 1961 to March of this year [1962]. Of these, 1,266 people returned while the [North] Korean side sent back 213 people. We found nine people who drowned while trying to cross the border.Regarding the issue of “authorization letters,” according to statistics from the Yanbian [Korean] Autonomous Prefecture, last year they received 2,667 “authorization letters” from [North] Korea. Out of this number, there have been about 1,778 applications to travel to [North] Korea; 1,053 applications have already been approved, while 735 applications were not approved.According to our understanding, the border crossing phenomenon has not eased mainly because we lack a process to resolve the temporary difficulties [facing China]. The density of urban populations is also a factor at play [in the problem]. In October 1961, the Northeast Bureau of the CCP received a forwarded report from local work units entitled “the Jilin Provincial Committee Report on Handling the Outflow of Ethnic Koreans.” There have been problems and shortcomings, however, in implementing the measures offered in the report [to resolve this problem]. For example, we originally stipulated that each ethnic Korean should receive 360 catties of grain each year, but some production brigades can only provide 200 catties. Additionally, local authorities tend to be too strict, overly restrictive, and sluggish when processing the applications of ethnic Koreans wanting to go to [North] Korea. The main reason behind the border crossings of ethnic Koreans, then, does not have much to do with the implementation of the [Sino-Korean] bilateral agreement on “authorization letters.”As we recently held a meeting to specifically study [this issue], we believe that resolving the issue of [illegal] border crossing requires us to complete our internal work properly, make proper living arrangements for ethnic Koreans and improve production. In order to resolve these issues, we recommend sending a three man team from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Public Security, and the State Ethnic Affairs Commission to the Northeast. Apart from resolving some specific issues that the [North] Korean side has raised, they will work with the provincial committees to further understand the situation and the existing issues. [The group] will then write a report to the Central Committee and [recommend] measures for improvement. Regarding the issues raised by the [North] Korean side, we will ask [Chinese] Ambassador Hao [Deqing] to meet with the [North] Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs, and with a cooperative and truthful attitude, explain to the [North] Korean side the situation, the causes, and the measures we have adopted toward the [illegal] border crossings. We will thank the [North] Korean side for their past assistance and will express our regrets for the difficulties which our ethnic Koreans have caused as well as the deaths that have occurred during border crossings. We will apologize [to the North Korean side] for having been too strict in implementing [our agreements], for poorly handling [issues], and for other shortcomings in our business [conduct]. At the same time, we should also appropriately explain our present difficulties and ask that the [North] Korean side understands the difficulty in halting the border crossing phenomenon. Using the above [information], write telegrams to the [Chinese] Embassy in [North] Korea and, under the name of the State Council, to Liaoning, Jilin and Heilongjiang Provinces. Approve both [telegrams] together. Ministry of Foreign AffairsMinistry of Public SecurityMarch 1962\n",

      "Top Secret[To] Ambassador Wang Bingnan,1. Your telegram dated 9:30 a.m., 8 September [1955], was received. After agreeing to the wording of the agreed announcement at the twelfth talk, the US side handed in the written agreement, in which the words “now” and “any such incident” were added. When accepting it, you did not carefully examine it and failed to notice [these changes] afterwards. Neither did you mention this in your report, nor did you telegram back the US amendment. This is negligence and a mistake. You are not allowed to commit this error in the future.2. Based on all circumstances, it is possible that an accord could be reached on the return of civilians at the fourteenth talk. At the next meeting, we should first of all try to finalize the text of the agreed announcement. In view of the different nature of nationals of both countries, it is to our advantage to use different wordings for the notification to the other side…3. After finalizing the text of the agreed announcement, we should take initiatives to suggest that both sides promulgate the agreed announcement simultaneously at 15:00 p.m. Geneva time (11:00 p.m. Beijing time, 24 September). You can also state that we will notify the US side of the results of the remaining US cases reviewed…If an accord could be reached, Beijing will promulgate the agreed announcement and announce the remaining US cases at an agreed time. We should also distribute the text of the agreed announcement to journalists at Geneva. But do not distribute notification of the results of the US cases.4. Regarding the text of the agreed announcement, we should take the initiative to suggest that both sides proofread and exchange the text. But do not ask the other side to sign. We may give the text in Chinese to the other side, and ask the other side to give us the text in English. If the text is not ready at the talk, you may request a one-hour recess for proofreading and exchanging the text. You should carefully proofread the text in English submitted by the other party to guarantee that it is identical to our text in Chinese. You must know that the US side is cunning in these details and treat it with caution. Don’t be neglectful and careless. 5. After confirming that the other side has given up on its request on the issue of the time limit and consented to the condition for promulgation of the agreed announcement, you may notify the results of the US cases reviewed: three convicted US nationals will be released before their sentences expire and seven will be deported. 6. […]7. If the US side raises the issue of the name list of US POWs from the Korean War and asks us to find out their whereabouts, you should deal with this in accordance with the telegram to you dated 10 August 1955. If the US side refuses to submit a complete list of Chinese nationals in the US, we absolutely cannot accept it nor promise to transmit it to the Korean Military Armistice Commission.[i] 8. Whether or not an accord can be reached on 10 September, we should take initiatives to suggest the next talk be on 14 September. We may also consent to a longer recess.

      "Report: 1951 June 26 from the International DepartmentComprehensive report on the Soviet Representative [Yakov] Malik proposal of peaceful resolution of the Korea issue: (One) June 23 During a broadcast statement Soviet Representative Malik said that he once again suggested the peaceful resolution of the Korea issue and specifically proposed the first step: 1. The warring sides should negotiate a ceasefire and an armistice; 2. The two sides should remove their armies from the 38th parallel.One. The spirit of the Soviet Union’s suggestion this time is the same as the previous times. In the previous times the Soviet Union did not list the Korea issue together with the Taiwan issue and the issue of [Chinese] representation. In terms of method of resolution, the Soviet Union once mentioned in the past: “[Resolution] by immediate ceasefire on both sides”Two. The special characteristics of the [new] Soviet suggestion are:1. Specifically mention steps towards peaceful resolution; the warring sides should negotiate and ceasefire.2. Very clearly mentioned the 38th parallel as the demarcation line between the withdrawing two armies. It is not the first time the Soviet Union formally mentioned the 38th parallel.3. It is not certain if peaceful resolution must be through the United Nations.(Two) Description of proposed solutions from the Soviet Union, our country and other countries related to the peaceful resolution of the Korea issue, the issue of the 38th parallel and other issues:One. In the past, towards the peaceful resolution of the Korea issue, the Soviet Union has proposed:1. Ever since the armed intervention of the United States government, the Soviet Union officially suggested four times to peacefully resolve the Korea issue within the range of the United Nations. The first was when Stalin telegraphed Nehru on 1950 July 15. The same year on August 4th, the Soviet representative in the Security Council provided a proposal to peacefully resolve the Korea issue. [The Soviet representative] again provided the proposal twice in the General Assembly on October 2nd and December 9th. Between the time when a proposal was provided by 12 countries and prior to Malik’s broadcast on June 23rd, the Soviet Union itself did not provide resolutions; [the Soviets] mostly support our suggestions.2. In sum, within the four [Soviet] suggestions, ultimately they all address the Korea issue:1. They have never mentioned the Taiwan issue or the issue of our country’s representation in the United Nations: Throughout [their] four suggestions, only in Stalin’s telegram to Nehru and the August Security Council proposal did they ever mention [supporting] the participation of the People’s Republic of China representative in the Security Council.2. The content of the proposal from August 4th and the two proposals from the General Assembly – namely the five-nation proposal of October 2nd and the counter proposal of December 9th which refutes the six-nation proposal – their basic contents were [all about] withdrawing foreign armies from Korea and having the Korean people themselves resolve the Korea issue. (The latter was mentioned in a General Assembly proposal)3. Regarding ceasefire, it was only generally mentioned. In the August 4th proposal it said: “stopping hostilities within Korea”. In the October 2nd proposal it said: “have the two warring sides ceasefire immediately”.4. All four [proposals] have been provided to the United Nations organization: [one proposal] agreed to have the Security Council handle the issue, [one proposal] was a draft resolution to the Security Council, the other two [proposals] were draft resolutions to the General Assembly.Two. Our previous proposals towards the peaceful resolution of the Korea issue1. Our first expression towards the peaceful resolution of the Korea issue was on 1950 August 20 when our Foreign Minister Zhou [Enlai] telegraphed the Security Council in complete support of the Soviet August 4 proposal on peaceful mediation of the Korea issue. Between then and Foreign Minister Zhou’s 1950 December 22nd statement, we have made numerous statements (including Deputy Minister Wu’s speech at the Security Council); the main contents of which are: (One) withdrawal of all foreign armies from Korea; (Two) Korean internal affairs should be decided by the Korean people themselves. We have not listed the Taiwan issue and the issue of our representation within the United Nations with the Korea issue [prior to 1950 December 22nd].2. On 1950 December 22, we first connected the Korea issue with the Taiwan issue and the issue of our [lack of] representation when Foreign Minister Zhou issued a statement regarding the illegal passage of a United Nations General Assembly resolution that established a “Korea Armistice Triumvirate Committee”. This year on January 17th when Foreign Minister Zhou proposed to hold a seven country conference, we officially proposed to resolve these three issues together.Three. Regarding current situation within the United Nations related to connecting the Korea issue with the Taiwan issue and the issue of our [lack of] representation:1. Twelve Asian United Nations countries first mentioned dealing with the Korea issue together with the Taiwan issue and the issue of China’s representation within the United Nations. On 1950 December 12, thirteen countries in Asia proposed to form the so called Triumvirate committee to arrange a ceasefire within Korea. At the same time twelve countries proposed to convoke a seven country meeting to formulate suggestions on the peaceful resolution of various existing disputes in the Far East. January 10th this year, the United Nations so called Triumvirate committee provided a five step proposal. This proposal proposed to first ceasefire then negotiate, the range of negotiation apart from the Korea issue also official includes resolving [other] issues of the Far East. After our Foreign Minister Zhou replied to the [United Nations] political committee on January 17 to propose four suggestions on the peaceful resolution of the issues of the Far East, on January 25th twelve countries again proposed to convoke a seven country conference so to make “all necessary measures towards peacefully resolution of the Korea issue, other issues of the Far East and secondary issues…”2. After the United Nations illegally passed a resolution which slanders our country on February 1st, the United States and Britain no longer list the Korea issue with the Taiwan issue or the issue of China’s [lack of] representation. On March 18th Associated Press leaked a discussion between [Trygve] Lie and the representatives of the United States, Britain, France and the three committee members of the “Mediation committee” to [establish a] plan to separate the ceasefire in Korea from other issues of the Far East. Since then, talks from the United States and Britain only mention issues related to a ceasefire in Korea. Four. Regarding the issue of the 38th parallel1. On December 22nd Foreign Minister Zhou provided a statement to the “Triumvirate Armistice Committee” and said, due to the fact that the United States and [Syngman] Rhee blatantly crossed the 38th parallel, this “political geographical border has been destroyed and forever wiped away.”2. The Soviet Union has never directly affirmed or denied the 38th parallel. The only [mention] was when [Andrei] Vyshinsky rebutted [Warren] Austin on 1950 October 2nd during the political committee of the General Assembly, he said: “There is no so called 38th parallel, it is an imagined non-existent border.” While he satirized the United States he claimed: “Without the existence of any border, there would be no border separating the two countries, and therefore there was no invasion.”3. In official recommendations of the past, only the United States officially mentioned the 38th parallel. Last year in the June 25th proposal of the United States, they mentioned having “North Korean forces withdraw to the 38th parallel”4. The United States, Britain and India all have their own opinion regarding the 38th parallel: (1) United States, since March this year, the idea of stopping the war along the 38th parallel has been widely speculated. [General Matthew] Ridgway claimed on March 12 that if the Korean War can end on the 38th parallel, then it would be a great victory for the United Nations. Press and observers in Washington reported that the United Nations and American armistice plans would be: to establish a 20 mile buffer zone (southern border at the 38th parallel) from east to west across Korea; under the ceasefire, all forces are to withdraw from the buffer zone; ceasefire will be monitored by the United Nations committee. On March 16 the New York Times claimed: “If the United Nations forces can stop the Korean War upon reaching the 38th parallel then that is great, but it is doubtful whether or not Beijing would also [stop at the 38th parallel].” India has always been attentive to the 38th parallel. On 1950 September 30th the Indian Information Agency reported that the Indian government stated if American forces crossed the 38th parallel then it would be a violation of the June 25th Security Council resolution that had condemned North Korea as the “aggressor”.\n",

      "Ministry of Foreign Affairs DocumentRecord of Conversation from Chairman Mao’s Reception of the Algerian Ambassador to China Mohamed Yala(Not reviewed by the chairman)Time: August 17, 1964 afternoonLocation: BeidaiheAttendance: Vice Minister Qiao Guanhua, Vice Minister Ma ZhenwuInterpreter: Huang QiNotetaker: Li TengzhiChairman Mao's Main Points:1. Imperialism is a paper tiger. The enemy has more troops and better equipment. The people's army is smaller and has poor equipment but it can nonetheless overcome difficulties and defeat the enemy. Don't be afraid to lose a lot of people, the population will grow rapidly after liberation.2. Two intermediate zones.3. Strive to win the moderate faction and suppress counter-revolution.4. Knowledge: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs can organize visits with friendly and Foreign Affairs can organize tours for the envoys of friendly foreign nations, not necessarily together with other envoys. We need to help the Embassy of Algeria.Algerian Ambassador to China Mohamed Yala's Main Points:1. The Algerian Party has not been well organized, and imperialists can take advantage of that.2. I hope to learn from China's experience in party building.The Main Points of Ben Bella's Letter:I hope that China will support Algeria's opposition to subversive imperialist plots and its efforts to build socialism.(Chairman Mao greets visitors outside the door)Yala: Thank you very much for receiving me.Chairman Mao: It is my duty.(After taking his seat, the Chairman asked the interpreter if he had been to Algeria. The interpreter responded that he had.)Chairman Mao: Do you know him? (pointing to the interpreter)Yala: Yes, I know him. We are old friends. I already have many Chinese friends. Your ambassador in Cairo, Chen Jiakang, has been my friend since the War of Resistance. I also know Mao Dun.Chairman Mao: He is a writer.Yala: I met him in 1958 at the World Peace Council and at the Asian-African Writers Conference. I have met Mao Dun many times. I worked with him during the 1962 Moscow Disarmament Conference.Chairman Mao: We didn't do well that time. Our policy was wrong and it offended many friends, especially African friends.Yala: Already from 1958 and 59, we began to oppose the French representative on the Peace Council and at the Peace Conference. We stressed the importance of national liberation movements and we cooperated with China. Every time Chinese friends want to cooperate with us, we must stress the liberation movements. We never refuse and always cooperate.At the 1959 meeting of the World Peace Council, we got into an argument with the French representative Casanova of the French Communist Party.I believe that Africa always praises China's position.Chairman Mao: We should emphasize and support those who stand against imperialism and colonialism and for national liberation.Your eight-year-long struggle was worthwhile. You won liberation. You made great sacrifices. Some people say that it was too big a sacrifice. It is said that you had a population of just nine million people. If you lose one million people and one million of the people in the country were foreigners, that leaves you with just seven million people. I tell those people revolution always involves sacrifices. The population will grow rapidly after liberation. How many people do you have now?Yala: To be honest, we haven't had a census since 1953. The French said that we had a population of ten million. We think it was higher than that. Now we are organizing a census committee so we will have a census. A census is a must for planning. Setting a plan without knowing how large the population isn't practical. The census work has not yet been completed. This work is very complicated. The population is very mobile. During the war, 400,000 refugees went to Morocco and Tunisia. The French even drove away the entire populations of some villages.Chairman Mao: How many Algerians live in France?Yala: 500,000 people.Chairman Mao: That's a lot!Yala: Yes. We want to build industry in Algeria. They can come back when they have employment opportunities as skilled labor. They also made contributions during the war. But at the time, French democratic elements as well as the French Communists refused to cooperate with us. We suggested to them that we form a united front against fascism but they wouldn't do it.Chairman Mao: We don't like the French Communist Party. We also don't like the Communist Party in your country. They are not satisfied with us either. They also oppose us. We don't know what made them hate us. The French Communist Party and the Algerian Communist Party of China both oppose us.Yala: That is because the Chinese party is a revolutionary party. After the ceasefire, the French Communist Party and the Communist Party of Algeria issued a joint communique claiming that they had supported us and that the liberation of Algeria was mainly due to the efforts of the French Communist Party and the Algerian Communist Party.Chairman Mao: This is called a Johnny-Come-Lately. They say this because you won. They didn't help you when you were in trouble.Your revolution has proved two things. A small army and not many guerrillas, just a few tens of thousands. There were a lot of enemies, and their numbers were gradually increasing. At most they were eight or nine hundred thousand people? I remember hearing former Prime Minister Abbas say that.Yala: Yes.Chairman Mao: You had so many enemies! He was not very cheerful then. I said, first of all, don't be afraid of casualties and sacrifices. Your population will increase after liberation; second, although there are many enemies you can defeat them.Your guerrillas later developed into regular troops. In the end, there were only a few tens of thousands of them. They had no planes, no tanks, and no heavy artillery. All they had were small arms. France has a navy, a powerful army, and an air force. In the end, who won and who lost? Was French imperialism a real tiger, an iron tiger, a fake tiger, or a paper tiger? France didn't have any support. You all oppose it, except for a small number of French running dogs. That is to say, the people were on your side. International public opinion and all the people of the world who want revolution were on your side.Yala: The example of the Vietnamese people too helped us win. Their enemies at that time were even stronger than ours. At Dien Bien Phu they struck a much heavier blow against the enemy than we did. This was not only an historic day for Vietnam but for the entire world as well. Now the Vietnamese people can also defeat the United States in the same way.Chairman Mao: Now the United States is in a difficult situation. They fear that the Vietnamese people will get stronger. The struggle of the people of southern Vietnam continues to develop month-by-month. Americans too aren't winning popular support. There are also 500,000 strong puppet troops in southern Vietnam. There were very few or perhaps no puppet troops in your country. The French were completely isolated at the time.Yala: Just as the Chairman said, only a few Algerians worked for the Emperor, but really it was a very small number. This group is still carrying out counter-revolutionary activities. They are causing problems in nationalized enterprises with the support of the United States and France.There is a colonel in the Sahara who led a rebellion. His activities are linked with imperialists who control an oil company.Chairman Mao: Didn't this colonel fight the French before? Someone who was once your comrade-in-arms?Yala: Yes. But he has feudal ideas. He was arrested not long ago.Chairman Mao: I heard that there other ministers were arrested. Is this true?Yala: The Minister of the Interior has resigned, but he is still a party member and a member of the Politburo. Abbas was placed under house arrest.Chairman Mao: Is Abbas opposed to you?Yala: He opposes our nationalization and everything else that we do.Chairman Mao: There is a Benda. What is he like?Yala: He presided over a drug cooperative. Of course he had his own opinions but did not engage in opposition activities.Chairman Mao: He did not work underground? He didn't engage in subversive activities?Yala: No, he didn't.Chairman Mao: There is also a Belle Kasem.Yala: Belle Kasem and Busuf have opposed the government before and are now working with us.Chairman Mao: Your policy is good. If you can win over the moderates, you should fight for their support as long as they do not carry out counter-revolutionary activities. Only suppress the counter-revolutionaries.Yala: Algeria is now implementing that policy. We only fight those who those take up weapons to engage in jungle warfare. We can't cooperate with them. We know that they are colluding with imperialism and colonialism. Some of them were trained in Portugal. They are also smuggling weapons along our coast. Portugal hates us because we support the struggle of the people of the Portuguese colonies. Portugal and South Africa openly opposes us. The United States secretly opposes us.Chairman Mao: Are the French taking advantage of the chaos in your country?Yala: So far, the French have not been found to be funding counter-revolution.Chairman Mao: Is France happy that you removed Abbas and put him under house arrest?Yala: Of course not they are not happy. Of course France is not happy with what we are doing now. De Gaulle is smart, but he is a reactionary too.Chairman Mao: Yes. He is an imperialist!Yala: De Gaulle is engaged in a lot of theater in his activities in underdeveloped countries. He is in open competition with the United States. Americans in Africa are like Asia in the past, as in Saigon, wanting to squeeze France out of Ivory Coast, Gabon, Senegal and other places. De Gaulle is more liberal than the United States and the former French colonialists.Chairman Mao: We use Charles de Gaulle to fight the United States. At this point we have something in common with Charles de Gaulle. He also sees that we have this point in common. In the opposite, he also needs us to help oppose U.S. imperialism. So we divide the middle camp into two parts. The middle camp is the so-called Third World. The first Third World is Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The second Third World includes countries like France, Japan, Canada and Europe. They all have some conflicts with the United States. This is not clear yet in some countries such as Japan and West Germany. With five or ten years, they will have to stand up. The monopoly groups in these countries and their big capitalists will not be willing to be controlled by the United States. There have been some signs of this already. Even some people in the British Conservative Party don't want to work so closely with the United States.Yala: Yes. What you are saying is exactly right. The reactionary governments that have stood side-by-side with the United States also having their problems with the United States. They take American money but also oppose the United States. No matter whether they are progressives or reactionaries, they result is the same: opposition to the United States.Chairman Mao: Why did the Americans kill the South Vietnamese Diem brothers? It seems incomprehensible. The Diem brothers opposed the Communists, opposed the people, opposed Ho Chi Minh, and opposed us. Why should they be physically eliminated? It is because sometimes they didn't obey. Therefore they need to be killed. The mastermind was Kennedy. But Kennedy leads us to the question: who killed Kennedy? Wasn't it an American? There are several groups among the American capitalist class. The interests of this group were damaged and so the head of the group was wiped out.Yala: Americans are assassinating people everywhere. Last August, when the foreign ministers of the countries of the Organization of African Unity were meeting in Senegal, the Americans wanted to kill Senegal’s President Senghor. They used a colonel in the Senegalese military. Later he was arrested. This is a contradiction within imperialism. Senghor is a reactionary, but he is pro-French. Americans everywhere want to drive out the French influence.A few days ago, it seemed like something similar was going on in Mali. Malian President Modibo Keïta says that the imperialists are always hatching plots.Chairman Mao: (Asks Vice Minister Qiao) Is that right?Qiao [Guanhua]: Yes. Modibo Keïta will soon come to China to participate in our National Day.Chairman Mao: How many people are there in Mali?Yala: Four million people. They are well organized and brave, wise leaders.Mali is not afraid of imperialist plots. They are well-organized. This is what Algeria lacks. Therefore, we are working hard to build our party.There are two countries in Africa who are not afraid of imperialist disturbances, namely Guinea and Mali. They are well-organized.Chairman Mao: How many people are there in Guinea?Yala: Three million.The party in Guinea is the best party in Africa. If the United States does not dare to hatch plots there, it is because the party organization in Guinea is good. In some places, Americans there are gaps that the Americans can take advantage of. For example, in Algeria and Ghana.Chairman Mao: When Ghanaian President Kwame Nkrumah visited China, I warned him about this. He should do business with us and the Soviet Union. He should withdraw from the British market and turn to the East. I said that the United Kingdom will give you trouble. At that time, the Ghanaian army was still commanded by the British army. As soon as he went back, someone tried to kill him but did not succeed. That may have been organized by the United Kingdom. In January of this year, there was another assassination attempt. I don’t know which country organized it. It may have been the United Kingdom. These countries used to be British colonies.Yala: But it could have been the United States as well. Afterwards, the masses went to the door of the U.S. Embassy to demonstrate and throw stones.Chairman Mao: It may have been the United States as well.Yala: Every assassination and conspiracy is a kind of anti-imperialist education for the people.Chairman Mao: Right. After the first assassination attempt, Nkrumah removed the British officers and sent them away.Yala: That is a good thing that came out of it.The Ghanaian army in the Congo is under British command. British officers are engaged in activities against Africans and Congolese. African troops commanded by Europeans military officers are being used against Africans. In Morocco, the army is also commanded by Frenchmen.Chairman Mao: What is the situation now?Yala: A former French general is still in the Moroccan army. Some Africans also bear responsibility for what the Europeans are doing in Africa.African troops are fighting Africans. As I said earlier, British command Ghanaian troops in the Congo and Ghanaian troops in the Congo and a Frenchman commands Moroccan troops.Chairman Mao: I told Ferhat Abbas that Patrice Lumumba’s difficulty was that he did not have his own army. He couldn't control the airport. The army was controlled by the reactionaries. Both Mombato and Casaboubu were pro-American.Yala: Completely pro-American.Now the United States cannot hide their objective. It was to put Moïse Tshombe in power. Some Africans were also responsible for this. Some people were involved in the plot. Some others did not object at the time but opposed it later.Chairman Mao: I am gradually coming to understand.Yala: He failed to be sufficiently vigilant. For example, when he returned to Congo, he crossed Mali. Mali's capital was revolutionary. Modibo Keïta would not have invited a Moïse Tshombe to Mali. Then there is the suspicion that the Americans directed things behind the scenes. Let Moïse Tshombe go to the capital of the revolution to look around and perhaps be touched by the light of the revolution.Chairman Mao: I heard that Keita refused to see him. Moïse Tshombe asked several times and only saw him once. Let's take a break now and enjoy a light meal.Yala: Please allow me to take this opportunity to pass to you a letter from President Ben Bella. (Yala hands Bella's letter to Chairman Mao.)Chairman Mao: Thank you. Is President Ben Bella also the general secretary of the party?(The guest and the hosts are seated at the table.)Yala: Yes. It was in his capacity as general secretary that he wrote this letter. We want to learn from your party building experience. During Premier Zhou’s visit to Algeria, he exchanged views with the leaders of the party. I hope that we will continue to exchange views in the future.Chairman Mao: We can share our experiences with each other.Yala: We can't talk an exchange. We are learning from you.Chairman Mao: No. Your party is a new party and has youthful vigor. It has now been established. Are you still building it?Yala: The Party Congress opened in April. Strictly speaking, the National Liberation Front is not a party but is like a parliamentary grouping.Chairman Mao: Is it a united front?Yala: Yes. The organization has just been established and a Central Committee set up for the first time. Now we need to build the party in the countryside. The peasants participated in the war. The vast majority of the population are peasants.Chairman Mao: Most of the people are peasants.Yala: Fifty percent of the people in Algeria are under twenty years of age.Chairman Mao: What is the ratio of urban population to rural population?Yala: About 75% of the people live in the countryside and 25% in cities0. After independence, the population has been flowing to the city. The government tried to block the flow but failed. These people don't have jobs in the cities but they badly wanted to live urban lives. One million French people left so now people live in French houses but do not work. These problems can only be solved one the party becomes well organized. We will have a lot of explaining to do. Now we need to focus our attention on organizational work. Regardless of how we fought the war in the past or today our struggle to build the party and oppose counter-revolution, none of this can succeed without the support of the people.Chairman Mao: The question is whether to build a party for the exploited or to build a party for the exploiters. No matter what country you are talking about, the exploiters are always in the minority.Yala: The same is true of Algeria. But they have friends. Their friends, the imperialists, can create trouble at any time.Chairman Mao: The most exploited workers together with the workers who are not exploited but who do not exploit others account for more than 90%.Yala: Yes, it is. There are different situations in Algeria and Morocco. A total of 22,000 people took French citizenship. They are people whose property has been nationalized and who had previously served in the French government. They can get compensation after they obtain French nationality. (Laughter)Chairman Mao: It is not bad thing that those people went to France. Chiang Kai-shek brought many people with him when he fled to Taiwan. The army has a total of about two hundred thousand. This is not bad. We suspect that he took less. It would be better if he had taken more. Take a few more, and you some good people will emerge from that group who will do good work for you in the future. However, there is no saying whether good people will emerge from your 200,000.Yala: I am afraid there won't be any good ones.(The chairman asked the interpreter what language is being spoken. The answer is French. The chairman asked Qiao Guanhua, is there a shortage of French speakers now? Qiao answered yes. The Chairman said: We don't have enough interpreters at our Embassy in Burundi. There is only one interpreter there.)Chairman Mao: We have just said that there are too few people who speak French. There is only one interpreter for our Embassy in Burundi.Yala: There is a Chinese in Burundi who was enticed away by the United States.(The chairman asked Qian Guanhua: What did that man do, was it the interpreter? Qiao said that it was the interpreter.)Chairman Mao: It was the interpreter. We are one person short (laughs).Yala: The Burundian government reacted very strongly on this matter. It was very brave.Chairman Mao: This is a good country.Yala: It is a kingdom, but it is better than some other countries. We have a good relationship with them. There is also Congo (Brazzaville). During his visit to Algeria, President of the Congo (Brazzaville) told us that he would send an ambassador to Beijing.Chairman Mao: Africa really has woken up and is determined to oppose imperialism. Shortly after you were liberated, you supported others’ struggle against imperialism. This shows that the people of your country are being led by a revolutionary party.Yala: We received Chinese assistance during the war. Our revolution could not have won without your assistance.Chairman Mao: First of all, the UAE helped you, not us. If it were not for the United Arab Emirates, our weapons would not have been shipped. We have established diplomatic relations with you. That was also done at the suggestion of the Arab League. They said that we should establish diplomatic relations with you. We agreed. That diplomacy was all done in Cairo.Yala: It could not have been done without the help of the United Arab Emirates. The committee that launched the armed struggle was established in Cairo. Originally known as the Maghreb Committee. People from Morocco and Tunisia attended. Later, because some opposed violence, the opposition to armed struggle, the organization split up. There was also an armed struggle in Tunisia in 1954, but it was not done by Bourguiba, since he was in prison at the time. Libya had a US military base. The base there is the largest base outside the Americas.Chairman Mao: Libya has also helped you during the war.Yala: Yes, Libya was Algeria's arsenal.Chairman Mao: Light weapons are still useful. The imperialists are afraid of rifles, machine guns, mortars, and explosives.Yala: Those are the best weapons for guerrilla warfare.Chairman Mao: 300 meters down to 200 meters is close combat. In close combat as well as in night warfare, aircraft are useless. There are no planes, heavy artillery, or navy in southern Vietnam.Yala: I heard that our southern Vietnamese friends use guns to knock down helicopters and small planes.Chairman Mao: They do that a lot.Yala: Yesterday in Beijing, the representative of southern Vietnam in Algeria told me that they had a hero who had shot down three helicopters with his gun in just one day.Chairman Mao: You could get into closer touch with them. Do you have diplomatic relations with Vietnam?Yala: Yes. The Vietnamese ambassador to Algeria was still in Beijing two days ago. I have to go to Vietnam in two days. I am also the Algerian ambassador to Vietnam. We will build our embassy there in four or five months and then send a charge d’affaires. We have some work to do in Vietnam. The French sent a group of Algerians to fight in Vietnam. When they arrived in Vietnam, they went over to the Vietnamese side, got married, and had children. Now they want to repatriate.Chairman (toast): Congratulations on your development! Congratulations on your victory! I wish President Ben Bella good health!Yala: A toast to friendship between China and Algeria and health to the Chairman!(After the meal, the interpreter read Ben Bella's letter to the Chairman. See the attachment below.)Chairman Mao: Thank you very much. You have had a lot to say. We will ask for your advice and exchange experiences with you. For example we have a lot to learn from the experience of Vietnam. We can't just rely on our own past experiences. They have made a lot of innovations. You, Cuba, and Vietnam all have new creations. The same is a Vietnam, the experience of southern Vietnam is much different from that of the north. A delegation leader in Vietnam said that there were some fears and fears for the Air Force when fighting in the north. But due to years of experience in the Southern War, this problem has been solved. Cadres, the army, and the masses are not so afraid. You have this kind of experience as well. You didn't have an air force at the time, and France had a strong air force. The head of a Vietnamese delegation said that when they were fighting in the North they dreaded and had great fear of the Air Force. But now, thanks to years of experience in the South, they have been able to solve that problem. Now the cadres, troops and the masses are not as fearful as they were before. You also have that kind of experience. You didn't have an air force during your war but France had a powerful air force.We fought for twenty-three years without a single plane. There are many enemy planes, all supplied by the United States. The Japanese also used planes to blow us up. Now the Americans, learning from their experience in the Korean War, now acknowledge that that their air force cannot solve their problems. Bombing railways and highways with their air force did not stop us from transporting supplies. The attacks did nothing more than kill some people, collapsed some bridges and destroyed some roads and railways. But not many people died because they transported goods by night and not during the day. Bridges were blown apart and so we organized engineering troops to repair the bridges. Bombing and repair, again and again and again. The Americans dropped a three-pronged object to destroy the car's tires. We organized teams to sweep away those kinds of things. There is also a napalm bomb that not only injures, but also kills people by sticking to the body and not falling off. We can defeat all these things.We have been fighting with two foreign countries. We fought Japan for eight years. Not the Japan of today, but the Japan of 20 years ago. Japan today has no colonies and is controlled by the United States. In Korea, we fought the Americans for three more years. At that time, only 20% of the soldiers were willing to go; 20% were opposed, and not willing to go; and 60% obeyed orders when they were told to go. In the end everyone went. It turned out that the Americans were not exhausted. Because the Americans are still irritating. We will overcome the difficulties that we face. All difficulties can be overcome. You also face serious difficulties.Yala: As the Chairman said, difficulties can be overcome, as long as there is the courage to do so.Chairman Mao: We have reached a consensus. Send a telegram to the President and the General Secretary with my regards. Can we make today’s conversation public? Or should it be kept confidential? Shall we publish it or not?Yala: It is up to you.Chairman Mao: I think we can issue a news bulletin about what the Ambassador said to the Chairman along with the letter from the General Secretary. (To Qiao Guanhua and Ma Zhenwu: Ambassadors from other countries should not take this as a precedent that they can just ask and they can see me.)Yala: Our Algerian news agency also published a message and said that we had handed over the letter and talked.Chairman Mao: Well then, the content of our discussions will not be published then. (To Qiao Guanhua and Yala: You two can take care of that)This brings today's discussion to a close. How did our discussion go today? Was it good or not? The climate is good here and you can rest for a few days. You might want to visit the Qinhuangdao Glass Factory, Shanhaiguan and some other places.Ma: He will return to Beijing tomorrow.Yala: There are many delegations from Algeria now in Beijing.Chairman Mao: That's good. Go see them right away.Yala: I'll go to Vietnam for two or three days to present my credentials there.Chairman Mao: (To Ma Zhenwu) I should arrange for a plane to save you some time.Yala: I would like to see some sights from the train.Chairman Mao: Yes, for the sake of seeing some sights it would be good to take the train.Yala: Thank you, Chairman, for receiving me, speaking with me so kindly, so I felt I could speak completely freely. Please excuse me for taking up your time.Chairman Mao: We are fraternal peoples and fraternal parties.Yala: There couldn't be a better brother.Chairman Mao: If you need something, just ask them (To Qiao and Ma he said, give him any assistance he needs) He should to other parts of the country to understand the situation, and not necessarily with other envoys. Individual tours and visits can be arranged for ambassadors from friendly countries.Yala: They have already helped us to build our embassy.Chairman Mao: How long have you been here?Yala: Since July 24.Chairman Mao: Not even a month.Yala: But the embassy has already been built. We are getting better treatment than other countries.Chairman Mao: (To Jiao and Ma) You should help them.(Photo with host and guest. While the group photo was being taken, the Chairman asked, why do we have so few people? Why don't we have the interpreter in the photo? The Chairman said to the interpreter, your work is very important. If it weren't for you, we would not be able to do our work. After the group photo was taken, the Chairman escorted the guests to just outside the door. He shook hands with them on the stone steps and said goodbye.)Attachment:Letter from General Secretary of the National Liberation Front of Algeria and President Al-Ahmed Ben Bella of the Republic of Algeria to Chairman Mao ZedongGeneral Secretary of the National Liberation Front, President of the Democratic Republic of Algeria, Al-Ahmed Ben Bella, to the Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Chairman Mao ZedongDear friend, Chairman Mao:The opening of the Embassy of the People’s Republic of Algeria gives me the opportunity to reaffirm to you, Mr. Chairman and dear friends, the friendly ties established between the great Chinese people and the Algerian people during the difficult period of the Algerian people’s liberation struggle against colonialism. I am convinced that in the struggle against imperialism and against both old and neo- colonialism, in the development of the world’s progressive forces and in the consolidation of world peace based on the principles of the Bandung Conference, that these friendly ties will continue to link the Algerian people together with the brotherly Chinese people.We had planned to open our Embassy in China for a long time, but each time the Algerian Embassy in China was postponed because of the reasons for our transfer, and so could not be opened immediately after the establishment of the first independent government of Algeria. Dear brothers and friends, you have been most understanding of the difficulties that our young country has encountered.Dear brothers and friends, you have been most understanding of the real difficulties encountered by our young nation. These difficulties have prevented us from sending people to our friends in various regions.Today, we have fulfilled our most cherished wish.Algeria faces a reactionary plots and conspiracies by various imperialist countries, and it is determined to build a socialist society that will forever eliminate the system of unfairness and exploitation of human beings.Algeria firmly believes that in the process of accomplishing this task, it will be able, just as it has in the past, to obtain all the necessary support necessary for the consolidation of its revolutionary achievements from the great Chinese people.The People’s Republic of China and the Democratic People’s Republic of Algeria have a great responsibility to continue, through cooperation in the struggle against imperialism, to effectively defeat the conspiracies of their common enemies and to find suitable solutions to the problems of the two peoples.I am convinced that on the basis of these principles, the Chinese people and the Algerian people will work tirelessly for the peace and human friendship of all mankind.With profound respect to our brothers.Ahmed Ben Bella (signed) (Translator's Note: There is no date in the original letter.

      "Request for the Consular Department to handle.[illegible]May 11Public [Security Serial] (61) 21CC Ministry of Public Security Party Committee Report [To] Premier [Zhou Enlai] and Comrades [Deng] Xiaoping and Peng Zhen:On the night of 9 May [1961], the Public Security Department of Liaoning Province reported by telegram that since [the beginning of] this year, there has been an increase of ethnic Korean residents crossing the border through Gulouzi, Hushan, the suburbs of Jiulian City, Langtao, and Anning in Andong [Dandong] to [North] Korea. The illegal crossings have developed from individuals and single households crossing secretly at night to groups attempting to forcibly cross the border during the day. According to incomplete statistics, between January and April we have found 240 households and 1,471 people attempting to cross the border; of these, 715 people made it across the border to [North] Korea, but the rest were stopped. This trend has continued into May, and, as of 8 May, 350 people have been stopped [crossing the border]. On the night of 8 May and on the morning of 9 May, we discovered two groups of 50 people at Jiulian City, 30 of them armed with wooden clubs and iron cudgels. Most of the people crossing the border are peasants; there are, however, also small numbers of the five social elements and smugglers. These people are from Andong, Anshan, Fushun, Benxi, and Luda [Lüshun-Dalian]. It has been said that there are also people from Jilin, Heilongjiang, Beijing and Tianjin. Recently, we have also found people from Anshan, Shenyang, and the surrounding areas who are actively preparing to go to [North] Korea. There are also 1,843 ethnic Korean households in Andong which are preparing to move to [North] Korea, and, of these, 153 households have already sold all of their property and have attempted to illegally cross the border.The Public Security Department in Liaoning Province believes that the present increase in border crossings among ethnic Koreans is due to the following:1. An inadequate understanding of the temporary difficulties [in China], improper living arrangements, and the habit among ethnic Koreans to move around.2. [Ideological] education for ethnic Korean residents has not been kept up.3. The [North] Korean government has not returned border crossers as stipulated by the Sino-Korean Border Defense Agreement. [Furthermore,] individuals who have already crossed the border are influencing those who that have not by writing letters. The [North] Korean government has even established reception centers along border crossing routes; while single Han [Chinese] men have been returned in a timely manner, whole families that crossed the border were settled on agricultural communes. Every laborer was given 40 yuan as a settling-in allowance and a fixed amount of grain. These measures have had a great effect upon the Korean minority in China.4. Bad elements have been instigating [border crossings].The Liaoning Public Security Office proposed five measures [to resolve] this issue: 1. Under unified leadership at all Party committees, begin making living arrangements, strengthen [ideological] education, and calm the morale [of ethnic Koreans].2. Strengthen interception work [at the border].3. Monitor the activities of bad elements through investigations and studies; first resolve internal contradictions among the people, and then resolve the contradictions between us and the enemy.4. For those that were intercepted while crossing the border, make proper living arrangements, offer financial assistance to return home, and fix any problems they have in production or their livelihood.5. In accordance with the stipulations of the Sino-Korean Border Defense Agreement, open negotiations with the [North] Korean side to immediately settle the issue of returning residents who have crossed the border. According to reports of the Liaoning Public Security Department, border defense representatives from Andong traveled to Sinuiju twice in early March and late April to discuss the return of border crossers with the [North] Korean side. The [North] Korean side’s response was that “these people are currently receiving [ideological] education, but the Chinese side’s opinion will be reported to [North Korean] superiors.”We have already [instructed] the Liaoning Provincial Public Security Department to actively work on stabilizing people’s lives and strengthening [ideological] education work under the instruction of the Party Committee. [We are] still awaiting instructions on negotiations with the [North] Koreans. We are presently studying the matter with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The above is a briefing.Ministry of Public Security Party Committee10 May 1961\n",

      "Comrade Gao Gang, also to be passed on to Comrade Yu Guangsheng and Comrade Liu Yalou:  The Soviet Ambassador Roshchin came in for a talk.  Because of the current Korean situation, sea transport  from Vladivostok to Lüshun and Dalian is no longer suitable for transporting military supplies.  So the Soviet government requested that, besides the opening of the two lines of the Chinese Changchun Railway, i.e. via Manzhouli or the Suifen River to Haerbin, and Shenyang to Dalian and Lüshun, we also allow the Soviet side to use air transport from Voroshilov, via our Dongning, Mudan River and Shenyang, directly to Lüda. These two requests are in accord with the spirit of the Sino-Soviet treaty.  Our side has agreed.  As to the detailed means, after discussion with Roshchin, the following agreement was reached: concerning rail transport, no matter whether (they) enter the country from Manzhouli or the Suifen River via Haerbin, Changchun and Shenyang to Lüda, or to Andong and then to Korea, Yu Guangsheng will need to be informed in advance by either the Soviet side’s Vice-Chair of the Chinese Changchun Railway’s Administrative Committee or the Soviet side’s Chinese Changchun Railway Bureau Director so that vehicles can be dispatched in time to avoid holding things up.  Our side authorizes Yu Guangsheng to handle this and report to the Railway Department in a timely manner.  Concerning the air transport question, the Soviet side has decided to utilize the Shenyang Aviation Institute to augment Soviet personnel, strengthen ground-air communications and report on Soviet planes crossing the border, to avoid any misunderstanding.  On our side, the Military Commission has decided to transfer Duan Suquan to (the position) of Northeast Region Air Force Commander, and has instructed Duan Suquan to establish contact immediately with the Soviet advisor at the Shengyang Aviation Institute and to report in a timely manner to the Military Commission Air Force Headquarters.  [Chinese Communist] Party Central CommitteeJuly 11\n",

      "(Top Secret) Comrade [Zhou] Enlai:Received your telegram of 15 May. Regarding our next steps on the Korean issue, after discussion, we agree to your suggestions. Specifically, that we should let neutral nations supervise the elections, not the United Nations. In addition, that we should also emphasize two things: first, that although we agree to let the neutral nations supervise the elections, these must be held after the withdrawal of foreign troops. Second, that the NNSC [Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission] should be organized to supervise the elections and to prevent interference by domestic terror groups only after the all-Korean commission, in which both Koreas consult as equals, drafts an election law. If the Soviet and Korean sides believe that it is appropriate to let the Chinese delegation make this suggestion, then the Chinese side should do so.CCP Central Committee 17 May 1954\n",

      "TELEGRAM 031.589To: the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Comrade Cornel Pacoste)From: the Romanian Embassy in DhakaDate: March 14th, 1978 Classification: SecretSubject: the visit to Bangladesh of the Vice-President of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. The visit in Bangladesh of the Vice-President of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Gang Ryang-uk, who is currently undertaking a tour in the region , has recently ended.Regarding this action, the first [secretary] of the North Korean ambassador said the following to the comrade Valeriu Simion, Second Secretary:The visit was a major success for the Koreans, exceeding the expectations of both the North Korean delegation and the Korean Embassy in Dhaka; the Bangladeshi government expressed its support for solving the Korean problem and the unification of the country on the basis of the interests of the Korean people, without resorting to war and without external intervention, on the basis of the agreement signed between North and South signed in 1972, all these points belonging to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s position. Moreover the Bangladeshi government does not consider the presence of the American forces in South Korea to be normal. The Korean Vice-President renewed his invitation for President Rahman Ziaur to visit Korea – an invitation previously made by President Kim Il Sung. If in the past Rahman Ziaur only accepted the invitation in general terms, this time he said “inform President Kim Il Sung that I will arrive in Democratic People’s Republic of Korea on October 1st”. The date is not publicly available yet. The North Koreans were simply amazed by this change in attitude in favor of North Korea, but it sees it with a bit of reserve, as it expects reactions from South Korea and the United States vis-à-vis Bangladesh.The Korean diplomat showed that several socialist countries in Europe, which he did not name but hinted at all of them except for Yugoslavia and Romania, shared an unfavorable view of the visit of the Vice President of North Korea and its outcome. Diplomats of the respective socialist countries said that the North Koreans should have waited for the European socialist countries to make contact with the government of Bangladesh before having engaged in such high-level contacts.We believe that the attitude of the Bangladeshi government towards the resolution of the Korean question is not a change of position in its foreign policy which is generally pro-Western, but rather a circumstantial position determined by the actual political in-fighting in Bangladesh. The current Bangladeshi government is trying to prove that it adopts constructive positions on international problems and seeks to improve its relations with as many states as possible, including with socialist countries.SignedIosif Chivu\n",

The Democratic People's Republic of Korea is very concerned with the fact that the Americans are providing South Korea with weapons, including nuclear weapons, which, according to some Western military experts, can guarantee the occupation of North Korea in 5-7 days. In these conditions, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is trying to find someone to resort to in case of emergency. From amongst the two big socialist countries, not that much aid is expected from China, which keeps changing its attitude towards the Korean matter according to its own interests in its relations with the United States. The death of Zhou Enlai intensified the oscillatory position of China and even if Mao Zedong would like to adopt a position that would be more favorable to North Korea, he no longer has the necessary power to do so.The North Korean diplomats insinuated that [they] could have much more faith in the USSR.(This conversation occurred between the North Korean diplomats and Valeriu Simion, second secretary).Signed: Ambassador Iosif Chivu\n",

Rinchin – Thank you, I am well. Kim Il Sung – How is c. Tsedenbal?L. Rinchin – Thank you, c. Tsedenbal is well. Kim Il Sung – Warm congratulations on the Foreign Minister’s and the accompanying comrades’ visit to our country. L. Rinchin – Thank you. Kim Il Sung – Although our two countries are apart, their relationship is very close and they develop socialism. I am happy to have such close friends as you, comrades. Every time I meet Mongolian comrades, I remember that during the hardships of war, [Mongolia] took and brought up our orphaned children, and provided material and moral aid. During the war, when our transport situation was difficult, despite the difficult situation of your own country, you presented a large number of horses, which was great help. The MPRP is true to principles of proletarian internationalism, and when you go back to your homeland, please tell comrade Tsedenbal and the Mongolian people that we have not forgotten the internationalist help of the Mongolian people. During the most difficult time of the war, there was one c. Sambuu as the first [Mongolian] Ambassador in our country. After we received the news of c. Sambuu’s passing, we expressed our condolences. He was a fighter comrade who shared the difficulties of war with us, and will never be forgotten. The Korean people will never forget all kinds of aid provided by the Mongolian people. Even now [you] support our socialist construction and, on the international stage, support our struggle against the attempts to create two Koreas, and for the withdrawal of American forces from Korea. We understand that [Mongolia] this year has become one of the initiators of the discussion of the Korean question at the UN session. We would like you to pass our thanks to c. Tsedenbal, the Central Committee of the MPRP, the government, and the Mongolian people. Your, Foreign Minister, visit to our country this time, contributes to the development of friendship and relations between our two countries and inspires the Korean people to struggle for the unification of the motherland. Congratulations, Foreign Minister and the accompanying people. Recently [we] sent a congratulatory telegram on the 50th anniversary of the establishment of the MPR. On the occasion of meeting with you, comrades, let me again pass my congratulations through you. L. Rinchin – Dear comrade Chairman, I am happy that you have lent your attention to us by giving us this audience. This is a clear manifestation of the respect on the part of the KWP, the DPRK Government and the Korean people of the MPRP, MPR government and the Mongolian people. Kim Il Sung – Thank you. L. Rinchin – I am happy to convey to you that the First Secretary of the MPRP Central Committee, the Chairman of the Presidium of the People’s Great Khural c. Yu. Tsendebal told me that in case of meeting with you, I should pass to you his warm greetings. Kim Il Sung – Thank you. L. Rinchin – I would like to express gratitude to You for sending the recent well-wishing telegram to the MPRP, the government and the Mongolian people, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the 3rd Congress of the MPRP and the anniversary of the establishment of the MPR. Kim Il Sung – Thank you. L. Rinchin – I would like to express gratitude for your comments, in which you highly valued the modest aid from the Mongolian people to the Korean people during the war, and for saying good words about our former president the late Sambuu. I will pass your words to my own party and the government. I am carrying out a visit to the DPRK on the invitation of Foreign Minister Heo Dam, becoming acquainted with the many successes of the Korean people in socialist construction. Foreign Minister Heo Dam and other comrades have done everything possible to make our trip successful by being attentive since our arrival. Yesterday, we had a discussion and exchanged opinions on some questions of mutual interest regarding the situation in our two countries. I believe that our visit will make an appropriate contribution to the strengthening of fraternal friendship and cooperation between our two countries. When I was leaving for your country, c. Tsedenbal instructed me to convey the following to you. These instructions express warm greetings to you and through you to the Korean people, to praise, on behalf of the Mongolian people, the great success achieved by the Korean people under the leadership of the KWP in the construction of socialism, and to express continued firm support for the struggle of the Korean people to peacefully reunify their motherland. Also these instructions, guided by the firm aspiration to develop friendship and cooperation between the MPRP and the KWP and the two peoples, invited [you] on behalf of the Mongolian People’s Revolution Party and the government to visit the MPR officially at a convenient time. I think that your visit to the MPR will become a public deed to strengthen Asian and global peace, security and cooperation and an important contribution to the development of relations between the two countries. (Passed the message). Kim Il Sung – Thank you. We will translate it later. Please convey sincere gratitude on behalf of the KWP Central Committee, DPRK government, and the Korean people, to c. Tsedenbal, MPRP Central Committee and the MPR government, for sending a warm friendly message. Thank you for inviting me to visit the MPR. Please convey that I accept this invitation and that I believe it can be realized at an appropriate time. Also I would like to thank c. Tsedenbal and the Mongolian people for their firm support of the Korean people’s struggle for the unification of the motherland. How is the current situation in Mongolia with the cattle and the harvest?L. Rinchin – The plan to increase the number of cattle is being implemented well due to the attention from the party and the government, in order to implement the goals of the five year plan of development our country’s people’s economy and culture. This year, there was an addition of 9 million heads. At the end of the five year plan the number of cattle will reach 25 million. Because snow fell early this year, and it became cold, and because of many cases of drought, there was less harvest this year than last year but it is possible to satisfy the people’s needs. It is possible to implement the five year plan in industry and the agriculture. Today we saw your industrial and agricultural expo, and became acquainted with the city situation by visiting the metro. This is all apart of the socialist construction of the Korean people. The Mongolian people will support, as before, the question of the unification of the [Korean] motherland by peaceful means. This is our internationalist duty. Kim Il Sung – c. Heo Dam probably spoke about the six year development plan of the people’s economy. In the agricultural sphere, the plan was basically realized. The goals of the industrial sphere will be solved next year. From these, chemical and steel industries are achieving considerable success. Considerable time is needed for the realization of the goals of the electricity and mineral extraction industries. These will be solved in the first half of 1976. Because our country is divided, we spend a lot of money on army expenses. The enemies have 1 million troops, and we are with 500,000 troops. Because many young men are drafted by the army, [our] labor force is in shortage. At the time when mechanization and automation have not been fully introduced, there is great need for labor force. We hope to realize the six year plan one year ahead for all spheres but mining, coal, and electricity. One needs to employ young men in the coal mining. If the American imperialists did not occupy South Korea, it would be unnecessary to have 500,000 soldiers. If one employ 400,000 of these soldiers in the State’s economic spheres, one could accomplish great work. It is not an easy question for a small country like us to have so many soldiers. The American imperialists occupy half of our country and want to perpetuate the division. We cannot be OK with having half of the country occupied. We struggle. The South Korean people also struggle. Yesterday, South Korean opposition parties and students conducted a demonstration of protest. The American imperialists suppress the opposition movement by means of the Park Chung Hee clique, and are trying to say that they have nothing to do with it. In reality, these are not actions of the Park Chung Hee clique but actions o the American imperialists. If there were no American imperialists in South Korea, the South Korean people would overthrow the Park Chung Hee clique. We do not wish to make war. We put forward a proposal to conclude a peace treaty with America, and to reduce the number of troops between us and South Korea. They not only refused to accept [these proposals] but they are trying to own socialism, they are waiting for us to fall asleep [sic]. That is why we teaching and calling upon our youth and people to be conscious, and, holding a gun in one hand, and a scythe in the other, to construct socialism and to struggle with the imperialists. Comrade minister, please pass to c. Tsedenbal, the MPRP Central Committee and the MPR Government that the Korean people are achieving great success in the construction of socialism in the DPRK and in the struggle for the unification of the motherland. Our two countries do not have any disagreements on any issues.Friendship and relations between our parties and people, based on principles of support for the  people’s struggle against imperialism and colonialism, for national liberation, for construction of socialism and communism, [on principles of] mutual noninterference in internal affairs. Please convey to c. Tsedenbal that there are no obstacles to the friendship and relations of the people of our two countries, and relations are developing in every sphere. L. Rinchin – I will convey your comments to the MPRP Central Committee, Government, and c. Yu. Tsedenbal. Respected comrade Chairman, I would like to express gratitude once again for finding the time to receive [me].On the occasion of meeting you, I would like to present a small souvenir – having said that [L. Rinchin] presented a knife decorated in the national Mongolian pattern.Kim Il Sung – Thank you very much. The meeting ended at 18 hours 50 minutes having continued for 45 minutes. The conversation was carried on in Mongolian and Korean languages, and was translated, on the MPR side, D. Jamyandorj, an employee of the MPR Embassy in the DPRK, and, on the DPRK side, by the section head of the MFA Ho En Yon. Acquainted [Signature] L. RinchinRecoreded by [Signatures] Ya. Dashnyam / J.

      "The Record of Conversation between Foreign Minister of Mongolian People's Republicand President Kim Il Sung of North Korea at 21 Dec., 197421 December 1974 PyongyangOn a Visit by the MPR [Mongolian People's Republic] Foreign Minister Comrade L. Rinchin to the General Secretary of the Korean Workers’ Party, DPRK [Democratic People's Republic of Korea] President Comrade Kim Il SungOn the invitation of the Deputy Prime Minister of the Administrative Council of the DPRK, Foreign Minister cde. Heo Dam, in the course of his official friendly visit as a guest of the DPRK government, MPR Foreign Minister cde. L. Rinchin paid a visit on the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the KWP, President of the DPRK cde. Kim Il Sung on 21 December 1974, at 6:00 pm. Audience was attended by, on our side, the head of the press department of the MFA Ya. Dashnyam, acting head of the 3rd Department of the MFA L. Badamragchaa, the acting head of the MFA Planning and Documents department B. Navchaa, MPR Plenipotentiary Ambassador in the DPRK O. Tsend and referent of the 3rd Department of the MFA J.

Kim Il Sung : Warm congratulations on the Foreign Minister’s and the accompanying comrades’ visit to our country. L. Rinchin: Thank you. Kim Il Sung: Although our two countries are apart, their relationship is very close as they develop socialism. I am happy to have such close friends as you, comrades. Every time I meet Mongolian comrades, I remember that during the hardships of war, [Mongolia] took in and brought up our orphaned children, and provided material and moral aid. During the war, when our transport situation was difficult, despite the difficult situation of your own country, you presented a large number of horses, which was great help. The MPRP is true to principles of proletarian internationalism, and when you go back to your homeland, please tell comrade Tsedenbal and the Mongolian people that we have not forgotten the internationalist help of the Mongolian people. During the most difficult time of the war, there was one cde. Sambuu as the first [Mongolian] Ambassador in our country. After we received the news of cde. Sambuu’s passing, we expressed our condolences. He was a fighter comrade who shared the difficulties of war with us, and will never be forgotten. The Korean people will never forget all kinds of aid provided by the Mongolian people. Even now [you] support our socialist construction and, on the international stage, support our struggle against the attempts to create two Koreas, and for the withdrawal of American forces from Korea. We understand that [Mongolia] this year has become one of the initiators of the discussion of the Korean question at the UN session. We would like you to pass our thanks to cde. Tsedenbal, the Central Committee of the MPRP, the government, and the Mongolian people. Your [Mongolian Foreign Minister's] visit to our country this time contributes to the development of friendship and relations between our two countries and inspires the Korean people to struggle for the unification of the motherland. Congratulations, Foreign Minister and the accompanying people. Recently [we] sent a congratulatory telegram on the 50th anniversary of the establishment of the MPR.

      "Ministry of Foreign AffairsTELEGRAMSender: New YorkNo.: 052648Date: 01.07.1975North Korean diplomats at the UN consider the letter addressed on June 27 to the President of the Security Council concerning the dismantling of the UN headquarters in South Korea, a “tactical maneuver to create confusion at this year’s session of the General Assembly.” Ambassador Ri Yun-gyeom [Ri Yun Gyom] pointed out that the US is taking a step back from their traditional approach to the Korean issue, when agreeing to dismantle the UN headquarters only if the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People’s Republic China accept in exchange that American and South Korean troops will take over the responsibilities of the headquarters, as well as by keeping in place the conditions of the Armistice. Through the above-mentioned conditions, the US is actually seeking to force North Korea into accepting the presence of American troops in South Korea and accept the latter as a state. According to the North Korean diplomat, such an approach represents an obvious interference in the internal affairs of his country as well as in the Korean efforts at reunification. The North Korean Ambassador has received instructions from home concerning his future actions at the UN. I however believe they will act towards rejecting and revealing US maneuvers.The only means of settling the dispute is via bilateral negotiations between North Korea and the US on the one hand, as well as between North and South Korea, on the other, in view of signing the peace treaty.Such a solution would allow North Korea to decide the deadline of US withdrawal from the Korean territory, in order to make way for a real territorial reunification.The North Korean diplomat appeared dissatisfied by the passive attitude of the Soviet diplomats displayed in talks he had with them about the US letter. They avoided formulating their own opinions on the new US position in the Korean context.Signed: Ion Datcu\n",

      "TELEGRAMSender: New York No.: 052.467Date: 09.05.1975As it is known, in the resolution adopted last year concerning the Korean matter, at the initiative of Western countries, the General Assembly expressed the hope that the Security Council, in consultation with directly concerned parties, will formulate those aspects related to its mandate, the dissolution of the UN headquarters [in Korea] included, all within the framework of adequate arrangements meant to preserve the armistice in Korea. From an occasional conversation with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea ambassador to the UN, transpires that he had contacts with the American side, with the purpose of turning the above recommendation into reality.From those mentioned by the Korean ambassador, we conclude that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is considering the possibility of reaching an understanding with the US concerning the dismantling of UN headquarters in Korea, and in so doing, of by-passing a discussion in the UN Security Council. It is possible that the US, as a result of an implied understanding, will take measures towards de facto dissolving the UN headquarters.In such circumstances, the General Assembly or the Security Council shall solely take note of the UN headquarters [in Korea] dismantling, similar to 1973, when the UN Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea was dissolved.

      "Moscow, 7th December 1963Received on 7th at 18h05Diplomacy ParisTelegram number 7125/28I am referring to my telegram number 71081\tAt the moment when Pravda is repeating the call made several times by M. Khrushchev for an end to the disputes between parties and calls on Beijing to play by the rules by giving up on ‘factionism’, the attitude of the Chinese delegation at the peace council meeting in Warsaw shows to what extent the CCP is not in line with the behavior suggested by the Soviets. \tBy presenting information about the Warsaw meeting, to which it has given great publicity, the Soviet press mostly emphasized the fact that the work of the peace council highlighted the renewed vigor of the people to push forward the causes of disarmament and détente, and to foil the intrigues of the warmongers. It underlined the call made in Warsaw in favor of a complete ban of nuclear tests, a non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, the creation of nuclear-free zones and cuts in military budgets. It also made note of the adoption of resolutions on problems such as South Africa, Korea, South and North Vietnam, where it sees evidence of the close connection between the struggle for peace and the efforts of national liberation movements. \tThe reports of the Soviet press did their utmost to minimize the differences that emerged once again between the Chinese or pro-Chinese delegations and the majority of the peace movement. It is heartwarming to note, wrote member of the Soviet delegation in Warsaw M. Kotov, that the delegates spent more of their time on factors that united them than those that divided them. The attempts made to divide the champions of peace were condemned.\tThe Soviet press confined itself to pointing out that various resolutions were adopted with strong majorities. It noted that the Chinese, Albanian, North Korean, North Vietnamese delegations, as well as some Japanese delegates, had voted against the resolution for the convening of a world peace conference. It also mentioned that the draft Chinese motion condemning the Moscow Treaty had only received 38 votes, with 21 of those from the Chinese. \tFinally, the press completely ignored the incident caused by the Chinese refusal to take part in the homage to President Kennedy.Signed Maurice Dejean\n",

Deperasinski\t\t\t\t\t2nd secretary of the Embassy of the RP in Korea\t\t\t\t\tChargé d’Affaires ad in.\f\t\t\t\t\t\tKorea, Pyongyang 1 September 1951\t\t\t\tREPORT\t1.- The July-August reporting period in Korea was marked by waiting for the results of negotiations on a truce in Gaeseong, intensified bombardments by the American air force and increased efforts by the working class and peasantry to boost production.\tThe recently intensified bombing has caused very many victims, for instance, the bombing of Pyongyang and its area alone on 30 July had 10 thousand victims. On 31 July and 1 August they bombed non-stop, and on 1 August they used gas bombs in Yeonan. Also on 7 August they dropped gas bombs in Jin-an province. In both incidents there were 22 poisoned soldiers, of whom 8 died and their bodies turned black. On 14 August, i.e., on the eve of the celebrations of the 6th anniversary of the liberation of Korea from Japanese occupation, some 500 planes bombed Pyongyang nearly all day long. The last daytime air raid was at 17:00 hours. I was in Pyongyang at 19:00. A picture of despair that is impossible to describe. Even though I know the city well already, we could not find the street. It needs to be added that there are very few houses left in Pyongyang, only one-level ones are left, and ruins of one- and two-storey buildings are a rarity. The wounded and corpses were being carried out from under the rubble. We saw scenes of despair, for example, children who were pushing aside the rubble with their little hands in search of their mothers. The bombing of Pyongyang had nothing to do with strategic bombing. They bombed, for example, two bazaars and there were very many victims. They also intensified night air raids in such a way that a plane comes every dozen minutes, and if he notices a light somewhere he bombs or shoots. The Americans are also dropping saboteurs on the territory of the Republic. Here we were officially informed on 31 July that in the mountains that surround our valley there is a larger unit of saboteurs. They communicate by imitating the voices of birds and they give light signs to the air force. We have been forbidden to go outside in the evening without guards, and if we go out even with a guard then we are to have weapons on us. During the day we are also not allowed to go into the mountains without letting the guard unit know.\t2.- The beginning of talks in Gaeseong, intensified bombardments and sabotage have had no demobilizing influence on the Korean nation whatsoever. On the contrary, the effort and sacrifices of the nation are getting stronger. This example is characteristic: peasants who have no money, in response to numerous appeals on the radio calling for giving donations for airplanes and tanks bring rice and edible grasses they collect.\tProduction – the struggle to increase productivity to assist the front.\tWorkers in factories (the locations of all factories are being kept secret) are straining all their forces in order to increase production. Party Committees are constantly coming up with new methods that would explain as clearly as possible in order to intensify the effort during production. For example, the chief of a railway station, Kim Sun-bae [Kim Sun Bae], in close cooperation with the party organization and with workers increased the safety of transport on his segment. The railway workers of this station are working as they remember the slogan, “let’s quickly send arms and ammunition, which will destroy the enemy, to the front. Because of the bombardments they are working only at night, but during the day they inspect the tracks and the nearest railway bridges, and this way are working faster. With great vigilance, they guard the cars loaded with ammunition at the station from potential sabotage. In their free time, they clear the shattered cars off the tracks. Once a week, the skilled railway workers devote 5 hours per day to teach the unskilled. Once a week, the Party Committee of this station organizes production meetings with the goal of exchanging experiences at work and the experiences of leading workers, announcing their names in wall bulletins, urging competition and imitation of the leaders. This is how the railway workers are fighting the battle to improve transportation. The state, for its part, rewards the railway workers first. On 4 July 1950 railway workers, with the Minister of Railways at the lead, were decorated for their heroic deed and their tenacious work to improve transportation. Factory workers and miners are fighting similarly. A certain coal mine, where Kim Chun-yong [Kim Chun Yong] is the chairman of the Party Committee and Pak Seon-gi [Pak Son Gi] the manager, executed 101% of its plan of extracting coal in the month of May, and then they seriously raised and surpassed the pre-war levels despite unfavorable conditions. The Party Committee played a huge role in this work, it organized the workers and engineers for the joint overcoming of all difficulties. There were great difficulties stemming from a shortage of work force and the insufficient mastering of techniques. Before the war, 20% of the needed workforce was missing, and on the day the war began 40% of the needed workforce was missing. Currently, the missing workers have been replaced by women. At first, the new female miners, unused to this work and not understanding the necessity of this work, had an unwilling attitude toward it. The party took on the duty of increasing productivity. It took on the political and technical training of the new women workers. The secretary of the cell, Yi In-ok [Yi In Ok] organized meetings with women, explained the situation on the front, the importance of the mine to the front, and the duties of the working class toward the front. It taught them to think not only about their family and their husbands, but also with their soldier-husbands and soldier–sons to think of the victory as the most important task. And they all understood it, and since then they have been uneager to work above ground and were raring to work underground in the mine. The skilled miners taught techniques to the unskilled miners, women and men, so that now 41 new women-workers are working on an equal footing with the old miners on the machines. Despite the conditions of hardship, this mine’s Party Committee takes great care of all its workers. When one of the best workers reduced his output, the comrades from the cell visited him at home and it turned out that this worker was living in very bad conditions, which worsened in connection with the birth of yet another child. The comrades immediately organized assistance for his family, and the productivity of this worker’s work rose again. This fact elevated the Party’s authority among the new women-miners and the mine’s successes grew so that it executed 120% of the plan.\tIn one of the factories a department needed 6 women to perform certain work. The workers reorganized the work and currently only 4 women are needed for it. 2 workers went to different work. This brigade, headed by Jang Byeong-ok [Jang Byong Ok], every day fulfills 16% of the plan. As a result of production meetings, exchanges of experiences, critique and self-critique this factory has obtained a 35% increase in production.\t2.- Agriculture. The Secretary of the Party Committee of the Province (voivodship) of Pyeongan explained to me that the peasants who have land in the lowlands deliver 27% of their crops, those who have land on slopes up to 15 degrees give 10% of their crops, and those who have land on slopes of over 15 degrees give the state nothing. He explained to me further that some People’s Committees have not adhered to the principle of the peasants giving the state 27% of crops and took 27% from everyone, not honoring the difference in fertility of the soil. Such incidents were stamped out by the Party and the state and the difference was returned to the peasants. This stand by the Party and state strengthens the peasants’ attachment to the country and increases their effort at work.\tThe peasants are executing their most active work currently on the eve of the harvest, pulling up weeds. The Secretary of the Party Committee of [North] Pyeongan province told me that, for example, in the town of Goan (Jeongju district) the peasants pulled up 13 tons of weeds on the 6th anniversary of the liberation of Korea. In many localities, the population of cities, the army and Chinese volunteers are helping them in their work. The pulling up of weeds is the realization of the Party’s slogan about increasing harvests, about delivering food for the army and the population.\tThe peasants of Jagang province have given the state their villeinage of potatoes and barley 10 days earlier than before the war. As for the barely and potato harvest, I have news from some provinces that it was better than had been expected. But rice, corn, millet etc., which had promised to be very good because of the spring sowing campaign, are threatened by the rains that lasted 6 weeks, which at times took on the dimensions of a typhoon.\tThese rains were a real natural calamity, they destroyed roads, tore down bridges and seriously slowed down transportation. For example, on the Cheongcheon river, cars cross on barges as bombs are dropped. No wonder that there are serious losses. During such a crossing, Heo Heon [Ho Hon], chairman of the Supreme People’s Assembly, the father of the Minister of Propaganda and Agitation (a woman) perished. The roads have been damaged to such an extent that vehicular access to the Embassy, which lies on a side road, was impossible. The lake’s banks broke, the water tore up the road, in some places 2 meters deep, and made a channel for itself out of this road.\t3.- Women. Korean women are being broadly pulled into work in factories. During the month of July alone, 150 women were promoted to factory directors or upper-level factory workers. Women are also working as engine drivers on the railroads. According to data of the Korean Central Telegraph Agency, alone in the province of North Hamgyeong during the anniversary action, 19,000 women were pulled into industry. It needs to be added here that the Korean woman was exceptionally oppressed during the Japanese occupation, so the current pulling them into industry is a great achievement of the Korean woman and a gain of new forces to strengthen the rears. Women, as part of the anniversary action of the 5th anniversary of equal rights, in northern Pyeongan province created 2 creches. Women alone take care of the wounded and they work hard and selflessly. Walking to Pyongyang, one can see them carrying the wounded on their backs to ambulatory stations and from there by a variety of random means of transportation. The Korean nurses follow the example of the nurses of the Soviet Red Cross. Here is the latest fact of 2 August. An ambulance was driving from the front to Pyongyang, a Soviet nurse was in it with the wounded, and she did not abandon them when the car was attacked by an American airplane and she perished together with them. This fact was widely discussed. A monthly has been published entitled “Korean Women.”\t4.- Education and culture. The preparatory action to open schools on 1.IX.51 is being widely planned. A preparatory course for teachers of 5-grade people’s schools has been created, and it lasts from 1 March to 1 September, 4,600 teachers are training. In July a 2nd course of this type was opened for 3,200 teachers with a deadline of finishing in November. In Sinuiju, a Pedagogical Institute has been created, where 280 teachers are training for elementary middle schools (end of middle school exam). At the same time 590 professors are being prepared for high schools (end-of-high-school exam) and technical schools. Following a directive from the Ministry of Education, 25 thousand teachers and professor for different types of people’s schools, high schools and universities are undergoing 3-month training. They are old, professional teachers. The preparation of the buildings themselves is being performed by the population of cities, towns and villages. The slogan has been issued: “Our school that is built by us.” The peasants are building schools with their own efforts, thus they bring wood from the forest, offer smaller building materials, pioneers are collecting old nails, the peasants are working for free and often donate their last savings. During meetings and rallies, calls are issued to make an effort to build schools. The People’s Committee stated that one of the peasants offered materials, which he had saved for his adolescent son, for the construction of a 4-room school. Pioneers in the same province collected 50% of the needed nails, and thus by 20 July they had executed 90% of their commitments. Half of the rooms are being built underground in shelters, so that during alarms lessons can be conducted. Teams of Chinese volunteers are assisting in the construction of the schools, especially the shelter-schools, just as they are helping with harvests or with pulling up weeds, and so on. The Chinese-Korean brotherhood and friendship can be noticed everywhere. On the 24th anniversary of the existence of the Chinese People’s Army, workers and Korean women sent many letters and gifts to the Chinese volunteers.\tThe opening of schools on 1 September is a courageous and difficult undertaking of the DPRK Government. The Minister of Education has told me that the difficulties that are emerging in connection to the opening of the schools fill many people with pessimism. Later in our conversation, he implied that he is counting on Poland to help school youth of the DPRK materially. Then he presented the issue of education in numbers. Before 25 June 1950, 1.5 million children of 7-13 years of age went to school. Now, the register conducted by 1 July yielded the number of 1,080 thousand children. There are 7,600 orphans among children of school age. Minister Baek Nam-un [Paek Nam Un] said that they must immediately provide clothes and, what is most important, shoes for 450 thousand children, and apart from that he fears that during winter in freezing temperatures many children will have to interrupt school for lack of clothing. To print school text books, they immediately need 200 tons of paper. They also need 11,230 thousand notebooks, 2.5 million dip pens with nibs, 15 million pencils and the same number of erasers for pencils, chalk for writing on blackboards, school bags, ink. Korea itself can deliver only 50% of chalk, ink and school bags. Further, they need towels, handkerchiefs and medicines for first-aid cases. The minister also told me that supplementary feeding of children in schools needs to be organized, and for now no one knows where they can get the appropriate amounts of products for supplementary feeding.\tOn 2 July, a so-called war industrial school was opened in North Pyeongan province. It is called “war” because so far only war invalids or the sons of those who fell defending the motherland can go to it. Five military schools were recently opened in the territory of the DPRK.\t Kim Il Sung, in his speech directed to writers and artists, said that in their daily work they should in writing demonstrate numerous examples of the heroism of the Korean nation, demonstrate the manliness and heroism of the army. In writing about heroes to demonstrate their working class or peasant origins. To write and show the barbarism of the Americans and Syngman Rhee-ites. The writers’ and artists’ appearances and works should be characterized by sacred patriotism. Writers and artists should utilize criticism and self-criticism. As they write, they should model themselves on the works of the leading country, the Soviet Union, and the people’s democracies.\t5.- National Holidays and Celebrations/ The July-August reporting period was rich in numerous celebrations and national holidays. Taking into account that before the outbreak of the war there were only 3 diplomatic posts in Korea, and now there are 7, this was the first time that such populous and ceremonious commemorations took place for in Korea.\tOn 1 July, the Embassy of the People’s Republic of China organized a banquet on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the creation of the Chinese Communist Party. About 40 persons were present. Politburo member, minister of finance Choe Chang-ik [Choe Chang Ik] (he was in the delegation to Poland in the month of March of this year) spoke on behalf of the Workers’ Party. Present were representatives of all diplomatic posts. The DPRK government was represented by the vice-premier, minister of propaganda and minister of security. The Chinese ambassador gave a 15-minute speech, then representatives of the diplomatic posts in turn took the floor and raised toasts to honor Mao Zedong, Stalin and Kim Il Sung.\tOn 11 July at 21:00 hours, the Embassy of the Mongolian People’s Republic put on a ceremonious celebration of the 30th anniversary of the Republic. Some 200 people were present. The reception took place in the hall of the CC Workers’ Party. There was not a single speech, which looked a bit strange in view of the importance of the celebration. Present were: the whole Government, Pak Jeong-ae [Pak Jong Ae], a few members of the CC of the Party, representatives of the press, Lab[or] Un[ions], Women’s, Youth Un[ions] etc.\tOn 22 July, the Embassy of RP [Polish Republic] in the DPRK organized in the CC of the Party hall in Pyongyang, deep underground, a celebration of the National Holiday of the Rebirth of Poland. The room was decorated with: portraits of President Bierut, Stalin and Kim Il Sung, flowers, little flags of the countries of people’s democracy whose representatives are present in the DPRK, so the Soviet Union, the People’s Republic of China, the Mongolian People’s Republic, the People’s Republic of Hungary, People’s Republic of Romania and the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, stood on the main table. Little Polish flags and a lot of flowers stood on all the tables.\tOver a hundred people were present, including the whole Government with president Kim Du-bong [Kim Tu Bong] and vice-premier and minister of foreign affairs Pak Heon-yeong [Pak Hon Yong] in the lead, members of the CC of the Party, Pak Jeong-ae, members of the General Staff of the Korean People’s Army, Chinese volunteers, members of the Central Council of the Council of Lab[or] Un[ions], Un[ion] of Dem[ocratic]Wom[en], Youth, labor heroes, peasants’ delegates, artists, the press, the Korean Central Telegraphic Agency and the diplomatic corps. The presence of the Ambassador of the Soviet Un[ion], Razuvaev, who apart from our reception was present only at the celebration of the 30th anniversary of the Mongolian People’s Republic and the 6th anniversary of the liberation of Korea from Japanese occupation. Kim Il Sung was absent, as during all the celebrations, but his secretary, Mun Il, apologized twice for Kim Il Sung’s absence, adding that he had wanted very much to come especially to the Poles’, but the arrival of Gen. Nam Il from Gaeseong because of a [no number]-day break impeded him. I made a 10-minute speech in Russian to open the reception. In the middle of the reception, which lasted 4 hours (receptions last a long time here) the film “Wide Road” was shown. After the film I invited all the guests for black coffee, fruit liqueurs and sweets. Polish ham, vodka, cigarettes and sweets were greatly appreciated. The evening ended in a joyful mood with the singing of revolutionary and national songs.\tThe National Holiday of the Rebirth of Poland met with lively interest in the DPRK. The Korean press ran many articles in which it presents the history of the liberation of Poland as well as achievements in industry, agriculture, construction etc. to its readers. (We will include a translation into Russian of an article from the central organ of the Workers’ Party, Rodong.) Our film “Wide Road” won great recognition. A few days later, I was told that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs put on a special discussion evening devoted to this film.\tOn 1 August a celebration of the 24th anniversary of the creation of the Chinese People’s Army took place. About a hundred people were present, including numerous representatives of the Chinese volunteers and of the Korean People’s Army. Present were all diplomats, apart from the Chargé d’Affaires of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. On that day, Pyongyang and the surrounding area were powerfully bombarded. Because of the bombardments and the poor state of the roads, the reception began 1.5 hours late. The Chargé d’Affaires of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic did not come to the reception, explaining that one should not be late. The hall was decorated with a large number of photographs illustrating the fighting of the Chinese volunteers in Korea. During the reception, a documentary film about the celebration of the creation of the People’s Republic of China was shown. The Chinese Ambassador, and no one of the military people, was the host of the reception.\tOn 15 August, the 6th anniversary of the liberation of Korea from Japanese occupation, was celebrated solemnly.\tThe working class and the peasantry have documented with their anniversary actions that they are prepared for further fighting to defend the sovereignty of their country. The government gave numerous awards for service to raise the output of work, increasing assistance from the rears to the front and for various heroic deeds of the civilian population on the 6th anniversary of the liberation of Korea from Japanese occupation. Railway workers were decorated first of all, already on 4 July, then social workers, [industrial] workers, peasants, writers etc. 150 railway workers, 101 social workers and 1,251 others were decorated.\tThe decorations are as follows: (1) Order of the National Flag, I, II and III class, (2) Order of Labor, (3) Freedom and Independence Order, (4) Order of Heroic Fighter, (5) Medal for Heroic Deed, (6) Medal for Service.\tThe central celebration of the anniversary took place in Pyongyang. The celebration of the anniversary was to comprise 3 parts: an exhibition of the achievements and accomplishments of the DPRK, a celebration and a reception. The organization of the exhibition was begun formally and practically on 1 August. The exhibition was to have a section on the countries of people’s democracy. The Ambassador of the RP [Polish Republic] in Korea gave photographs, books in Polish about Korea, propaganda materials, 2 films (“Wide Road” and “Chronicle”), a state flag and portraits. For their part, the Koreans also gave examples of Polish gifts to Korea to the exhibition. The exhibition was to be opened on 14 August. On that day, Pyongyang experienced the most powerful bombing since the beginning of the war. The exhibition was bombed, and 13 people, employees of the Ministry of Propaganda and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who were busy preparing the opening of the exhibition, perished. The solemn commemoration took place on 14 August at 20:00, and 800 people were present. The commemoration took place in a newly built theater 40 meters underground. The roster of those present included: Kim Il Sung, [Kim] Du-bong, all members of the Government, representatives of the army, a numerous delegation of Chinese volunteers, representatives of social organizations, the diplomatic corps, and so on. Kim Du-bong opened, Kim Il Sung made the programmatic speech, all the representatives of diplomatic posts and army also spoke. The commander of the 4th Army spoke on behalf of the army. At the end of the official part, telegrams were sent to Stalin, Kim Il Sung and Mao Zedong. After the official part, artistic performances took place and the film “Young Partisan” was shown. On the 15th in the evening at 19:00 a reception took place. 400 persons were present. During the reception, telegrams from Stalin and Vishinsky arrived. The reception lasted until 4 in the morning.\tOn 13 August at 13:00 a solemn women’s Celebration took place in Pyongyang. All the women from the diplomatic corps were invited. Pak Jeong-ae was present. After the Celebration, a film about the 2nd World Peace Congress in Warsaw was shown, in Russian translation. Pak Jeong-ae said that she had received this film as a gift from the Soviet Embassy.\tOn 22 August a celebration of the 2nd anniversary of the constitution of the People’s Republic of Hungary took place in the hall of the CC of the Party. About 100 persons were present, including 25 Hungarians (18 doctors and 7 people from the dipl[omatic] mission.) The Hungarian envoy, Pastor, made a 3-minute speech. Of the most important personalities, present were: Kim Du-bong, Pak Heon-yeong and Pak Jeong-ae. The Hungarian health team formed a chorus and made the evening pleasant with the singing of national and revolutionary songs.\tThe Hungarians possess a hospital for 3,000 people in Korea with its own full equipment, ranging from bedroom slippers and dressing gowns to surgical tools and x-ray machines. The hospital is systematically supplied with necessary medicines by Hungary. A part of the hospital with 1,000 beds is located at a dozen or so kilometers from Pyongyang. They are closing down the hospital they have in Manchuria and developing the hospital they have near Pyongyang. The whole Government, party and state activists use the care provided by this hospital.\tRecently, a delegation of Hungarian women came from Hungary, and with them 2 journalists and one film operator. Apart from them, a Hungarian reporter arrived in Gaeseong.\t\tThe Hungarian Diplomatic Mission is richly supplied with means of transportation, gasoline, it also possesses an [?] and so on.\tOn 23 August in the hall of the CC of the Party a celebration of the national holiday of the People’s Republic of Romania took place. Over a hundred people were present, including the whole Government, President Kim Du-bong and many other personalities. In the middle of the reception, 2 Romanian documentary films were shown, one about an exhibition about Korea in Romania and the second about the celebration of the national holiday in 50 in Romania. Both films were received by those present with great interest.\tThe Romanians possess in Korea, in Sinuiju, a hospital for 3,800 people, fully equipped with their own inventory, drugs, operating rooms and so on, and staffed by a Romanian health crew of 22 people, including 8 surgeons. The hospital is supplied systematically with necessary medicines by Romania. According to a statement by a Romanian doctor, mortality in this hospital is 0.5%.6.- Activities of the RP Embassy in Korea. […]7.- Offers: a. They are again sending signals about the great need for clothing in Korea. The situation has worsened even more because of the typhoon which struck Korea. Thousands of people are being incessantly tormented by bombardments, which, apart from human losses, take away roofs over their heads and their whole, already miserable, belongings. Right now, the typhoon has taken the homes and total belongings away from more thousands of people. The typhoon destroyed many agricultural fields and brought huge losses in production because many factories, which are usually located underground, have been flooded. In Pyongyang, a bomb destroyed a dam and the water flooded parts of the city. The situation of the population is very difficult. Half-naked people and naked, haggard children are nesting in caves in the hills.\tb) I suggest that we take care of the school-age children, so help with clothing, shoes, writing materials, medicines and food.\tc) I suggest that because of the great shortage of transportation we send ambulances for the health service. I believe that we must continue to send all medicines, and especially vaccinations against tetanus.\td) I suggest sending spades, pickaxes and hoes because I have seen myself many times how in Pyongyang following bombardments people removed the rubble with their hands. The need for these tools also stems from conversations I have conducted with various employees of ministries. I also suggest sending pneumatic hammers and drills. Shelters are still being built in Korea for various goals and tools that they are using in construction are the hammer and steel cutter. Building a shelter with such tools requires a lot of time and many hands.\te) I believe that there should be a permanent ambassador in Korea. All the diplomatic posts, except for the Polish and Czechoslovak ones, are staffed by ambassadors or envoys. Comrades from the Soviet Union and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have questioned me whether an ambassador has been nominated yet.\t\t\t\t\tDeperasinski [signature]\t\t\t\t\tR.

      "From a discussion had by one of the members of our mission with a Chinese diplomat, the latter implied that the People’s Republic of China does not regard favorably, quite the contrary, is even worried by the possible withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea. In this vein, the Chinese diplomat mentioned that ‘some Western countries’ consider that withdrawal from South Korea would create a ‘vacuum,’ which, sooner or later, shall be filled by the U.S.S.R. with the approval of the DPRK. The Chinese diplomat expressed his ‘puzzlement’ regarding the refusal of the DPRK to accept a U.S. military presence in South Korea after the two states had been welcomed into the U.N. Referring to the possibility of debating ‘the Korean issue’ at the next U.N. General Assembly meeting, the Chinese diplomat expressed his opinion that the only possible results would be the dissolving of the U.N. commission for Korea and of the U.N. commandment for foreign troops stationed in South Korea. He suggested that the People’s Republic of China would not oppose the stationing of U.S. troops in South Korea, granted they are based on bilateral agreements.Signed: Chargé d’affaires Ion Duma\n",

      "EMBASSY OF THE HUNGARIAN PEOPLE’S REPUBLICSerial number: 299/80Produced in 3 copiesCentral: 2 copiesEmbassy: 1 copyPresenter: Schiff GyörgyTOP SECRET!Pyongyang,1980 November 11Subject: Foreign opinions regarding the KWP’s 6th CongressWe do not wish to evaluate the congress or its documents in this report, we are merely reporting a few typical opinions of the delegations who attended it. Primarily, we must mention the impressions of the delegations coming from closely cooperating socialist countries, which can be summarized briefly as follows:The KWP’s 6th Congress did not present essentially anything new; it only summarized the well-known Korean viewpoints that were formulated since the 5th Congress regarding subjects of ideology, politics, international life, and international efforts of the KWP and the DPRK. The characteristic attribute of these views is a pragmatic and nationalistic approach that is moving more and more away from Marxism-Leninism.From among the socialist countries’ accredited diplomats, we do not know the critical opinions of the delegates of Yugoslavia and Romania, we only heard of their comment stating, so to speak, that these are Korean internal political questions and no opinions will change their Korean policy. That Albanian diplomat’s remark is more noteworthy, the Albanians were not invited to the congress by the way (they informed us through other means), who said the following: “What kind of congress it is where not a single word mentions Marxism–Leninism, and parties with no connection to communist ideologies participate as well?”Based on reliable information from diplomats of friendly countries, many Marxist, or self-proclaimed Marxist party representatives and individuals have more or less the same idea about the 6th Congress of the KWP. Thus for example, according to the famous Australian journalist Wilfred Burchett, huge progress has been made in the DPRK’s life during the last 25 years. However, there has been a change in their political line as well, and they are moving further away from Marxist–Leninist ideologies. They are supporting that Pol Pot regime that committed one of the biggest crimes against humanity since World War II against the Cambodian people.A representative of the Communist Party of India, in addition to the above, also criticized that in a congress of a communist party, why did delegates from parties whose ideas are far from being Marxist–Leninist participate.The representative of the National Liberation Party of Costa Rica condemned the non-existent democratism in the KWP, and the fathomless cult of personality as its result.The delegates of the Socialist People’s Party of Denmark, the Social Democratic Labor Party of Norway, the People’s National Congress of Guyana, the Socialist Party of Lebanon, and others as well, advocated against the dynasty-founding efforts seen in the KWP, the method proposed by Kim Il Sung in eliminating the military blocks, which lacks elements of the Marxist classes, and against the renaissance of “Stalinism” in the DPRK. They also expressed their skepticism about the “glorious” economic achievements and the long-term economic objectives that were presented at the congress.At last, we have to talk about the opinions that praised the congress and the juche in superlatives. These made up the majority of the participating delegations: mostly African delegations, and representatives of various juche circles and institutes, for whom by the way, the travel expenses were financed by the DPRK, but there were some delegates from European self-proclaimed Marxist parties among them as well. Most of these people were interviewed on television and some of their laudatory comments were published in the press.A new aspect of the KWP’s politics is definitely worth to be noted. They are making efforts in approaching Western European social democratic parties. These efforts were already apparent during the congress, where the representatives of the attending six Western European social democratic parties, or simply members, as for example the Norwegian journalist, were given special attention.When travelling home, the representatives of these parties brought the greetings and best wishes of Kim Il Sung to their respective leaders, as well as his hope that they would liaise with the KWP in the future. We have to mention here the, otherwise non-public, travel of Kim Jong-nam to Austria, France, and Spain right after the end of the congress. According to Soviet diplomats, the purpose of his travel was to establish connections with the social democratic parties of these countries. This fact fits well the picture of the uniquely Korean pragmatic, nationalist political line, with which the Koreans, according to them, are trying to achieve the following:As the majority of the Western European social democratic parties are leading or ruling parties in their respective countries, establishing good connections with them not only could result in political support for their cause (e.g. reunification, isolating South Korea, mediation of negotiations with the United States, etc.), but it may also lead to forming economic and trade relations with them.According to our unconfirmed sources, the DPRK wishes to become a member of the Social Democratic International as well.In conclusion, as variegated and mixed the composition of the foreign delegations attending the 6th Congress of the KWP was, which once again reflects the unique Korean view that, as lacking in Marxist class elements, can only described as an endeavor for demonstration, the expressed opinions were more or less just as diverse. The representatives of the Marxist-Leninist workers’ parties however clearly, and this is the most important for us, expressed the aforementioned worries that the KWP is diverging more and more from their ideology.Etre SándorAmbassador\n",

Similarly to the 5th Congress in 1970 November, the document and the changes detailed in it have not been made public this time either.Last time our embassy sent home the translation of the Party Rules that we received via our friends in document 31/Szt/1971, and recently it did so with the new German translation as well in document 155/SzH/1980. In the meantime, we had the opportunity to look into the Korean version of the rules. I will detail the most important changes in the Party Rules in the following.The introduction part dealing with the Korean Worker’s Party determines that the “Korean Worker’s Party is a juche-type, revolutionary Marxist–Leninist party, which was founded by Comrade Kim Il Sung… The Korean Worker’s Party considers the teachings of the Great Leader Comrade Kim Il Sung: the juche ideology, as its sole guiding principle.” (In comparison, the relevant part of the previous Rules stated the following: “The Korean Worker’s Party considers Marxism–Leninism and Comrade Kim Il Sung’s constructive application of Marxism–Leninism, the grand “juche” ideology, as its only guiding principles in its activities.”)The new document marks the ultimate goal of the party in “…arming the entire society with the juche ideology and building the communist society”. Previously there was no mention of society’s “juchefication” in this form. The following sentence of the Party Rules was completely missing from the previous one: “The Korean Worker’s Party is incessantly fortifying the ideological and willpower unity and integrity of the whole party based on the juche ideology”.Based on the aforementioned, it is obvious why there was no reference to Marxism–Leninism during the congress, and why the “juche ideology” was emphasized more than ever before.There was an entirely new paragraph in the current rules. According to this, the Great Leader Comrade Kim Il Sung created the first communist organization of the country in 1926 (he was 14 then)… and later founded the Korean Worker’s Party. The referenced statement contradicts historical facts, and among others, conceals the existence of the Communist Party of Korea between 1925 and 1928.We could not avoid noticing that even though the current Party Rules talk about the dictatorship of the proletariat, but they do not mention strengthening it against anti-classification, they do not detail the “revolutionary spirit of self-reliant prosperity”.The Party Rules accepted ten years ago summarize the reunification policy of the party as follows: “The Korean Worker’s Party consistently follows the direction for the peaceful unification of the Nation; actively provides help and support for the South Korean people in their anti-American fight to expel the American imperialism – the sworn enemy of our country – from South Korea; against the resurging aggressions of Japanese militarism; to overthrow the landlords, and the puppet system of the comprador, reactionary bourgeoisie; to take over the power; and to finish the South Korean revolution”. In contrast, the corresponding part currently sounds like this: “The Korean Worker’s Party is fighting for the withdrawal of the aggressive troops of the American imperialists from South Korea, for eradicating their colonial system, for foiling the new aggressive plans of the Japanese militarism; it is providing active support and help in the fight of the South Korean people for democratizing society and for the basic rights; it is fighting for an independent, peaceful reunification based on the principles of great national unity, and for the unified development of the nation”. The obvious content change reflects the main points of the 1972 joint statement between the North and the South in its principles for reunification, the change that happened in the DPRK’s reunification policy in the meantime.The principles of the unique foreign political directions of the party are reflected in the corresponding part of the new Party Rules, which states that “The Korean Worker’s Party is fortifying unity with the socialist countries and the international movement based on principles of independence (previously Marxism–Leninism) and proletarian internationalism…”. In this paragraph, not only the fight against imperialism, but against dominationism is present as well.The first point of the chapter about the party members stated the criterion of party membership in the following: “A member of the Korean Worker’s Party is a conscious revolutionary fighter, who uses all their power to fight for the party, the Nation, and for the ultimate triumph of socialism and communism”. The corresponding part currently is: “A member of the Korean Worker’s Party is a juche-type communist revolutionary who devotedly fights for the party, the leader, the people, and the grand cause of socialism and communism”.A change in the central organization chapter of the party is that the party’s congress has to be convoked once in every 5 years now, whereas it had to be held once in every 4 years before. However, both the Party Rules from ten years ago, and the current one as well contains the possibility that “the Central Committee of the party can also convoke the congress earlier or later if necessary”.The constitution of the party enables it again to establish and elect members into the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau that was functioning until 1970. (This did happen during the congress.) The modified Party Rules do not determine, as before, that the Political Bureau has to hold a session no fewer than once a month.Compared to the previous practice when the Central Committee’s Military Committee was also elected – among others – during the Central Committee plenary session, a significant changes is that from now on they will “establish” and “organize” it. It is thus likely that determining the composition of the Military Committee was removed from the scope of the Central Committee, as there is no mention of future elections. It is also worthy to note that Kim Jong Il, the son of Kim Il Sung, is in second place among the members of the Military Committee. He became a member of all the most important leading organs of the party during the congress, or more accurately, his positions were made public during the congress.There are changes in the number of members in the organizational units of the party, and in the objectives awaiting various high ranked party organizations of the People’s Army. The regulations in the latter mostly became stricter.It is noteworthy that paragraphs about Labor Unions, the Alliance of the Agricultural Workers, the Alliance of the Socialist Working Youths, and the Women’s Alliance were completely omitted from the chapter detailing the organizations of the party and the workers.Finally I would like to mention that I have doubts regarding the originality of the previous and current Party Rules that the Koreans gave to our friends. I am assuming that the two Party Rules, which are the subject of this report, are not completely the same as the actual Party Rules that the KWP members who live in the DPRK received. It seems that the analyzed Rules were written for informing foreigners and the KWP members who do not reside in the DPRK. (Party members can be… Korean citizens, thus South Korean, Korean living abroad, etc. who are legally considered the citizens of the DPRK by its constitution.)This assumption seems to be supported by the opinions of our Soviet friends, and the fact that according to some party members whom we asked after the 6th Congress, they have not received the new Party Rules yet.Independently of whether the contents of the previous two paragraphs will be confirmed later or not, the following can be asserted: The Korean Worker’s party attempts to replace Marxism–Leninism with the “juche ideology” or – as quoting foreigners from the press or the Koreans living abroad – “Kimilsungism”. The maverick Korean political direction that derives from the unique mixture of revisionism and dogmatism may hold many surprises for us in the future. These could be – depending on the internal power relations – positive for us, or the opposite as well.Etre SándorAmbassador\n",

Celebrations were also held at the same time on the occasion of the 35th anniversary of the foundation of the Korean sister party. (1945 October 10)The agenda of the congress:1)  The report of the Central Committee;2)  The report of the Central Control Committee;3)  Report on the modification of the Party Rules;4)  Election of the leading organs of the party.The congress was attended by 3062 members with the right to vote, and 158 members with the right to debate. For this occasion, the Korean sister party sent out invitations not only to sister parties of socialist countries, but invited all parties from developing, non-aligned, and Western European countries that the KWP liaises with as well. Besides these, the representative of the International Juche Alliance, the DPRK-sympathizer Koreans living in Japan, etc. were also invited. Furthermore, representatives of other parties of the DPRK, certain South Korean organizations that operate abroad, and juche circles were also present. More than 170 delegations from some 120 countries were present at the event.The delegations of the socialist countries – aside from some exceptions – were led by Politburo members. Li Xiannian Chinese delegation leader, the Guinean president Sékou Touré, the Zimbabwean Prime Minister R. Mugabe, the leader of the Romanian delegation Ilie Verdeț, the leader of the Soviet delegation Comrade Grishin, and the Secretary General of the Spanish Central Committee S. Carillo were enjoying a distinguished reception.The Hungarian party delegation was led by Comrade Méhes Lajos, member of the HSWP (Hungarian Socialist Worker’s Party) Central Committee Political Bureau, and the first secretary of the Budapest Party Committee. Members of the delegation were: Comrade Varga István, the deputy department head of the HSWP Central Committee’s Foreign Division, and Etre Sándor, Hungary’s ambassador to Pyongyang.II. The Korean Worker’s Party’s 6th Congress differed from other congresses held by sister parties both in formalities and in regard to its contents.Formalities: This congress was not ruled by a work-oriented atmosphere, but rather by one with a festival nature almost always from the beginning until the end. Already weeks before the congress and the anniversary, procession practices stretching into late nights were taking place, in which hundreds of thousands were participating next to their exhausting jobs that they undertook as part of the production campaign offered in the frame of the congress. The festival nature was further underlined by the fact that foreign delegations only attended the opening ceremony, the report of the Central Committee, and the closing ceremony. (In spite of the specific request of the Hungarian delegation, attendance at the other work programs of the congress was not allowed. According to our knowledge, besides the KWP’s congress delegates, only the Koreans from Japan, and the foreign juche circles could participate on those.)The height of the festival was the procession in the spirit of the congress, with hundreds of thousands of participants. (According to the official Korean report, there were a million people marching, which means that for this occasion they also mobilized and transported hundreds of thousands of people from country towns to the capital!) Our sources told us that all essential question were discussed and decided on before the official opening of the congress.Content: In the history of the Korean Worker’s Party (and most probably in the history of the international communist movement as well), this was the first communist party congress where there was not even a single mention of Marxism–Leninism, unless we consider the half-sentenced references to the so far not modified (presumably due to pragmatic reasons) organization rules. They talked all the more however about the maverick philosophy of the KWP: the juche ideology (or as they were spoon-feeding it to foreigners: “Kimilsungism”)! We have to note here that ten years ago, during the 5th Congress, Kim Il Sung stated that the juche ideology is a version of Marxism–Leninism applied to Korean circumstances and that the KWP “views itself as Marxist–Leninist party”. During the last ten years in the DPRK however, there was a qualitative change in the interpretation of the juche ideology: the classics of Marxism–Leninism chose their answers correctly for the problems of the world in their time, but since then the world has changed – so to speak – and only the juche can answer correctly to today’s issues. This way the propaganda of the DPRK elevates the juche ideology above Marxism–Leninism and claims it to be the highest-level ideology of our, and of all times.The Central Committee report of the 6th Congress, and the approved decree describes the juche ideology as the only correct worldview. Using the words of Kim Il Sung: “There is no place for any other ideology in our party besides the juche”, furthermore “The party organizations have to educate their members so that they know of no other ideology than the juche”. (The essentials of juche and its brief evaluation is contained in the attachment of our report.)The Central Committee report and the approved decree essentially contains the summary of the views that were conceived in the last ten, but especially during the recent years with regards to ideology, politics, and as such, internal policies, international life, and the international objectives and activities of the KWP and the DPRK.-   From the economic point of view, it is novel that – compared to the 5th Congress – there are barely any mentions on the issues of the control and planning system. It would seem as if everything was completely alright, and thus based on this fact, they can set up those ambitious objectives that since the congress they label as “the 10 great goals of the 80-s”. (Respective attachment.) The report and the decree focus heavily on foreign trade, yet there are absolutely no references on how the problems that arose in the world economy might also affect negatively the economic life of the DPRK. This in itself makes the reality of the goals questionable (oil problem, negative changes to international exchange rates, etc.), not to mention the present issue of the DPRK’s indebtedness.-   There are only few substantive elements in the Central Committee report and the congress decree regarding military compared to the documents of the 5th Congress. Military questions are discussed only in a quasi-hidden manner, whereas they assigned a separate chapter for this issue during the 5th Congress. Among the tasks awaiting the people’s army, the emphasis is on the leading role of the party, the enhanced “juchefication”, and the armed protection of the accomplishments of the party and the revolution.-   There are no separate chapters on improving the standards of living neither in the Central Committee report nor the congress decree, whereas this was also a separately discussed topic during the 5th Congress. The documents of the 6th Congress only tangentially outline the issue of living standards, not as one of the main objectives.-   The new formulation of the reunification policy deviates significantly from the language used in the documents of the 5th Congress. There, they refused the “deceitful propaganda for peaceful reunification” of the South, and proposed financial and moral support for a possible revolution in the Southern part of the country. Here, the Central Committee report summarizes the suggestions of recent years in ten points, in which the Korean comrades envision the unification of the country in a confederative framework. (See our attached summary of the Central Committee report!) Concerning the reality of the ten-point proposal however, the Korean comrades themselves also have little hope in it for the time being. At least, this seems to be indicated by the statement of Kim Il Sung in front of the leader of the Bulgarian congress delegation, in which he stated that they cannot currently expect any meaningful results from the negotiations with the South Korean authorities, but the South Korean masses will not be unaffected by the ten-point proposal.-   The congress documents discuss the KWP’s and the DPRK’s foreign policy views and objectives in the already known manner. Without including any Marxist class views, they talk about non-aligned movements, the “rivalry of superpowers for establishing their respective spheres of influences”, how this endangers world peace, the issue of military blocs, “dominationism”, etc.-   We also must mention the newest and singular manifestation of cult of personality amidst the international communist movement: the elevation of the son of Kim Il Sung, Kim Jong Il, to the number two leader, and the adoring reverence of his role in the remarks during the congress. (See the comments of Ji Jae-jong, Lee Gil-seon, Jeong Jon-hyeok, and O Geuk-ryeol in the attachments!) It was not phrased formally in the documents, but the view that Kim Jong Il will be chosen as the “successor of the leader” is still maintained in the internal propaganda. The authenticity of the long-term plans concerning him are further supported by his publically announced functions in the party, the organizing and governing activities attributed to him in state, party, and remarkably in military life, and lastly the constant bowing around his presence (as seen in television broadcasts and documentaries).III. Changes in the top body of the KWP as a result of the 6th Congress compared to those appointed during the 5th Congress are the following (List attached!):1)  After creating the institute of general secretary, the KWP Central Committee’s Politburo Standing Committee was established, which consists of five members with Kim Il Sung at the top. The other members are: Kim Il, O Jin-u, Kim Jong Il, and Lee Jong-ok. This body had already existed before the 5th Congress.)2)  The members of the KWP Central Committee Politburo was increased from 11 to 19. Seven members remained from the old one, thus the number of the new Politburo members is 12. (In reality however, many of them had become Politburo members between the two congresses.)3)  From among the KWP Central Committee secretaries, Kim Jong Il is in the first place, and only Kim Jung-rin remained from the secretaries elected during the 5th Congress. (Many of the Central Committee secretaries acquired their position also between the two congresses in this case as well.)4)  The number of alternate members of the Central Committee’s Politburo was increased from 4 to 15.5)  The KWP’s Central Military Commission was reinforced. During the 5th Congress it consisted of one chairman and three vice chairmen. The list of the members was not publicized. Currently the Central Military Commission consists of one chairman and 18 members. (The names of the vice chairmen were not published.) Among the members, the highest ranked is O Jin-u Defense Minister followed by Kim Jong Il, and then the rest of the personnel with the most important military posts.In summary, we can determine that the KWP’s 6th Congress was a “juche type” party congress, with which the KWP took further qualitative steps in its departure from Marxism–Leninism with the actual endorsement of the congress. The juche ideology already in its current interpretation, but by also taking its inevitable further evolution into account, could become the source of conflict between the KWP and the Marxist–Leninist parties. At the same time, due to its features representing thick nationalism, and its pragmatic ambiguity, it could become a common denominator in the unprincipled bargaining with the South. Even so, because the expression with its nationalistic content can often be found in columns of the press in South Korea as well.Etre SándorAmbassador\n",

      "SOVIET EMBASSY IN THE DPRK\t\t\t\t\t\t        9 December 1969\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  Nº 424SecretCopy Nº 1[CPSU CC stamp:4171115 DECEMBER 1969 Korea]KOREAN-CHINESE RELATIONS IN 1969(memo)A notable shift occurred in the direction of normalization of political relations between the DPRK and China in 1969. The patience and restraint with respect to Peking displayed by the Korean leadership has brought definite results which are being perceived quite optimistically in Pyongyang. Recent events confirm the assumption that at the 2 October Peking meeting the sides came to a common opinion about the need to improve relations. There were no signs of an improvement of Korean-Chinese relations in the first half of the year. According to some information at the end of last year and the beginning of the current year the Korean side had unofficial contacts at the level of Minister of Foreign Affairs Pak Seong-cheol and his deputy Kim Cheh-bong [sic; proper Korean spelling unknown] with the purpose of exchanging opinions on the questions of the upcoming Moscow Conference of Communist Parties and a border settlement. However, these contacts did not lead to any improvement of relations and, as is evident, did not influence the KWP position regarding the Moscow Conference. [Translator’s note: “N. Shubnikov” was written in the left margin].Border incidents provoked by the Chinese side have periodically erupted on the Korean-Chinese border on the Yalu and Tumen Rivers. The most critical of the incidents we know of occurred on 15 March (on the day of the second Chinese provocation on Damansky Island), when about 50 Chinese servicemen dressed in civilian clothing raided a Korean village. The Korean authorities displayed exceptional patience in this case, refraining form using force against the provocateurs. In the words of residents of the border city of Hyesan the Chinese have been waging a “water war”, having built a strong dam in that region and cutting off 2/3 of the river so that the water pressure washed out that part of the Korean bank on which there hangs an enormous monument in honor of the 1937 victory of the Korean partisans at Pochonbo. A propaganda duel with the aid of loudspeakers and billboards has continued along the entire border. [Translator’s note: there is a stamp at the end of the first page stating that “the material is informative and the CPSU CC Department has been familiarized with [it]. Katerinich; 15D/6 10 February 1970. Sector chief, (Katerinich)]]. [[To the]] archives”, and one additional illegible signature].The Korean comrades have been silent about the border incidents in view of its special position with respect to China, explained by a fear of an increase of subversive provocative activity on its part, not to mention taking retaliatory measures. In response to our information about Chinese provocations on the Soviet border Kim Il Sung responded with a certain measure of sincerity responded that they themselves “would have to find a mediator to settle questions of border incidents with the Chinese” (from a 14 April 1969 conversation with the Soviet Ambassador). Additional confirmation of the rift in DPRK relations with China was that the Korean comrades did not react at all to the 9th CPC Congress. Not a single report about China appeared in the Korean press during the period from February through June.During that period the behavior of Chinese diplomats in Pyongyang was defiant. “The Chinese are refusing to accept the notes of our MFA like the notes of our Embassy in Peking”, Cde. Pak Seong-cheol complained[“.] They accept invitations to the DPRK MFA as [they] wish. About 30 times we have suggested they remove the photo showcase from the wall of the Embassy; finally, for two years already we have been proposing to conduct a joint repair of the Sup’ung [Shuifeng] Hydroelectric Station, but everything was fruitless. All their behavior is pure tactlessness.” (from a 1 April 1969 conversation with the Soviet Ambassador).Some signs of normalization started to be displayed only in the middle of 1969. According to unofficial information available in the staff of the Soviet military attaché in June and July talks of authorized representatives of both sides on the question of a border settlement were held on Chinese territory. The sides came to a mutual agreement regarding the passage of the border for almost its entire length. One of the main contentious questions, the ownership of Paektu Mountain, was finally settled by the border passing through the center of the lake located at the summit of the mountain, dividing Paektu into two equal parts. One has to suppose that the agreement achieved put an end to the long Korean-Chinese dispute with respect to Paektu Mountain, although obviously it did not satisfy the Koreans, who wanted to own this mountain entirely, it being a symbol of revolutionary traditions for them. Moreover, because of the overly rigid position of the Chinese side several other sectors of the border remain unfinalized, which was obviously intentionally left unresolved by the Chinese in order to have the ability to pressure the Korean side in the future. Nevertheless the situation on the border has been normalized to a considerable degree; no information has come about any new incidents.Both sides have noted the latest anniversary of the treaty of friendship, cooperation, and mutual aid (July 11th) on a higher level than last year. For the first time in several years the DPRK Committee for Cultural Relations With Foreign Countries [s granitsey] and the Korean-Chinese Friendship Society sent letters of greeting to the respective Chinese organizations on this occasion. Anniversary events held in connection with this date in the DPRK and China found a comparatively broad reflection in the Korean press.The 42nd anniversary of the creation of the PLA (1 August) was also noted at a higher level in the DPRK. Prominent Korean leaders, Pak Seong-cheol, O Jin U, Jeong Jun-taek, and others, attended a cocktail party and film showing held on this occasion by the Chinese military attaché. (A Deputy Minister of Defense of the PRC was the senior guest at the 8 February Korean reception in Peking on the occasion of the 21st anniversary of the KNA, and at the reception in the Soviet Embassy on the occasion of the 51st anniversary of the Soviet Army [the senior guest was] the Deputy Commanding General of Artillery of the KNA).Thus, it was already evident from protocol measures that some shifts in Korean-Chinese relations are beginning to take shape and that the Korean side is exhibiting greater initiative in this matter.“We have offered a proposal about the normalization of relations”, declared Cde. Pak Seong-cheol to the Soviet Ambassador on 11 August 1969, “but the Chinese are not yet entering into discussions and have not yet even given an answer”. Exactly a month later during the Korean delegation’s return from Ho Chi Minh’s funeral, a meeting was held in Peking between Choe Yong-geon and Zhou Enlai. According to some information agreement in principle was reached at the meeting about inviting a DPRK delegation to take part in the celebration of the 20th anniversary of the PRC and holding discussions.However, some circumstances of the following period give reason to think that the Korean comrades were evidently not completely confident that they would receive the invitation and that the discussions would be held, let alone yield any success. On 1 October the DPRK press did not publish any of its own anniversary materials about China. Cde. Kim Il Sung’s 30 September telegram of greetings to the Chinese premier on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the PRC was exceptionally brief and dry.[1] The invitation to the Chinese holiday was obviously received so late that the Korean guests did not make it to the government reception held in Peking on the evening of 30 September.The DPRK Party-government delegation to the celebration of the 20th anniversary of the PRC as quite representative from both the Party and government sides: it included Choe Yong-geon, a member of the Politburo Presidium, KWP CC Secretary, and Chairman of the Presidium of the DPRK Supreme People’s Assembly (head of the delegation); Pak Seong-cheol, KWP CC Politburo member (now a member of the Politburo Presidium), and Deputy Chairman of the DPRK Cabinet of Ministers; and also Kim Yeong-nam [Kim Yong-nam], Deputy Chief of the KWP CC International Department and Kim Cheh-suk [sic; proper Korean spelling unknown], Korean chargé in China.The delegation was splendidly greeted in Peking and at a high level. The Premier of the PRC State Council held a reception in its honor, which passed in a “friendly atmosphere”. On 2 October talks were held between the head of the Korean delegation and Zhou Enlai in which Ye Jianying, Deputy Chairman of the CPC CC Military Council; Xie Fuzhi, Deputy Premier of the State Council; Qiu Huizuo, Deputy Chief of the PLA General Staff (members of the CPC CC Politburo); and Han Nianlong, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, took part. The talks, like the government reception, passed in a “friendly atmosphere”.The Korean comrades officially informed the Soviet Embassy about the results of the trip of the delegation to Peking; however, the information was extremely skimpy. In particular, Kim Cheh-bong [sic; proper Korean spelling unknown], Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, informed the Soviet chargé that “now conditions can be created which allow an improvement of relations in the future”, inasmuch as the sides “reached agreement to restore contacts, communications, and consultations”.As far as the Embassy knows, Korean diplomats abroad (for example, in China, the CSSR) who say approximately the following give a more optimistic evaluation to these discussions in unofficial conversations: now no unresolved questions remained between the DPRK and China; China completely supported the DPRK policy with respect to South Korea and even promised to give aid in the even of a conflict on the Korean peninsula as it was in the period of the Korean War. It seems that the unofficial statements of the Korean diplomats abroad can be believed no less than the official information of a DPRK MFA representative on such a complex and delicate question as how are their relations with “the big neighbor” are for the Korean comrades.After the Korean-Chinese discussions in Peking the strained nature of relations between the sides actually diminished perceptibly. The Korean press began to publish materials about China, although not many, [began] to publish excerpts from articles of Renmin Ribao and Xinhua reports directed against the US, Japan, and South Korea. Reciprocal visits of groups and delegations have increased (it is true, without press reports). The word “comrade” has again started to be used in official telegrams of greetings. The official activity of the “Society of Chinese Emigrants in Korea” has been resumed and the schools for the children of Chinese in the DPRK have reopened.The Korean side noted the 19th anniversary of the entry of the People’s Volunteers in the Korean War (25 October) with emphatic warmth. According to unofficial information, this time large groups of Chinese who come from neighboring regions of China took part in the celebration of this anniversary in the border cities of Sinuiju and Hyesan. Some wording of previous years were changed in the anniversary materials of the Korean press: in particular, the entry of the People’s Volunteers into the war is now tied not to “the appearance of a direct threat to China” but to the threat to the security of the socialist countries and international peace; unlike past years “constant and active support to the Chinese people in its just struggle for the liberation of Taiwan” is being expressed (Rodong Sinmun, 25 October 1969).The number of Chinese specialists giving the DPRK technical assistance has recently increased (according to some information, they number up to 400 people right now, that is, considerably more than the Soviet specialists, although the volume of current commitments for China to give technical assistance in civil construction is comparatively small – 70-80 million rubles). A vacuum tube plant, a textile mill, a cellulose and paper mill, a refrigerator plant, a sugar mill, and several small power stations are being built in the DPRK with Chinese aid.According to information coming from the Chinese Embassy in Pyongyang, the trade turnover between the DPRK and China might grow this year if the Korean side performs its obligations for the amount of deliveries, the range, and the quality of goods. However, in the words of the Chinese diplomats, this year the DPRK is poorly supplying their goods, which are at a low quality at that (the Chinese are especially dissatisfied with Korean machine tools); in response, the Chinese side is reducing its deliveries. As a result, the total volume of trade turnover in 1969 is approximately 115,000,000 rubles against the level of 125 million rubles actually reached in 1968. The list of Korean and Chinese goods remains as before.China continues to supply the DPRK with military equipment: tanks, aircraft, and spare parts of them, artillery, small-arms, and ammunition. Trains coming from China to the DPRK with this equipment have been noticed by members of the diplomatic corps during trips to Peking.There are also signs that DPRK and Chinese scientists are conducting cooperation in the area of atomic research and possibly in the construction of a second atomic reactor (the first was built with Soviet aid). The arrival in the DPRK of Chinese specialists in nuclear physics has been noted. The supposition that the acute shortage of electrical power in the DPRK is explained not only by the small amount of precipitation, but also by a diversion of a considerable part of it to the needs of atomic research or certain practical work in this field is not unfounded.The open and sometimes even demonstrative support which the Korean comrades again now express for Chinese nuclear explosions, after a certain normalization of relations, is symptomatic. This is demonstrated by the “warm congratulations in the name of the entire Korean people” sent to Peking leaders Mao Zedong, Lin Biao (!), and Zhou Enlai on 8 October by Cdes. Kim Il Sung and Choe Yong-geon and also the congratulatory telegrams of the DPRK Academy of Sciences and the Korean-Chinese Friendship Society about the nuclear weapons tests in China held in September of this year. The fact that on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the PRC Cde. Kim Il Sung emphatically wished China “new successes in the struggle to strengthen defense capacity” also called attention to itself.In 1969 there was no exchange of representatives or delegations between the DPRK and China in the fields of culture, science, sports, or between public organizations. Evidently, due to well-known reasons cultural cooperation will remain and in the future be the most complex area of Korean-Chinese relations.The opportunities for Chinese, as well as any other, propaganda to the DPRK are quite limited by virtue of strict restrictive measures on the Korean side.Peking conducts radio daily broadcasts on four one-hour schedules in Korean (from 2000 to 2400 Pyongyang time); the broadcasts are received in Pyongyang audibly, almost without interference. The two main themes of these radio broadcasts are praise of Mao Zedong and anti-Sovietism; almost no special materials about Korea are ever broadcast.The influence of Peking radio propaganda on the DPRK population is insignificant on the whole: the bulk of the Korean population does not have radio receivers, and receivers available for personal or public use are tuned to one Pyongyang wavelength. For DPRK citizens listening to Peking, Moscow, or other foreign radio is fraught with the risk of being accused of disloyalty. Especially reliable cadre of a more or less high level naturally constitute an exception.The PRC Embassy tries as much as possible to spread propaganda literature among other embassies in Pyongyang, including that of an anti-Soviet content. At the request of Cde. Pak Seong-cheol, it does not sent such literature to Korean institutions. A frequently-refreshed photo display window is maintained on the wall of the Chinese Embassy in Pyongyang in spite of numerous demands of the Korean MFA to remove it. However, the population is actually prohibited from passing along the wall on which the display is located.By virtue of the tense nature of Korean-Chinese relations until recently diplomats of the Chinese Embassy did not have such contacts with the local population and Korean institutions as, for example, Soviet diplomats have. The Chinese use events held at their Embassy which, it is true, are infrequent, for anti-Soviet propaganda, and also their contacts with representatives of Afro-Asian countries in Pyongyang. At the 1 October reception in the PRC Embassy last year the Chinese chargé made a crude anti-Soviet speech. The Korean comrades reacted to the attacks of the Chinese with a report about this reception which was as short as possible, and placed on the last page of only a single Korean newspaper. There were no such attacks by the Chinese at official events held at the PRC Embassy in 1969.In a word, when possible the Korean comrades obstruct the dissemination of Chinese propaganda in the DPRK inasmuch as they are connected with praise of Mao in one way or another and differ from their own propaganda in several aspects. They also do not approve of the anti-Soviet statements of the Chinese. When inviting a Chinese delegation to the 20th anniversary of the DPRK the Korean comrades placed a condition to refrain from criticism of the Soviet Union. They have exerted efforts for representatives of China (and Albania) not to take part in the international conference of journalists held in Pyongyang in September 1969.The Korean comrades have sufficient reasons to be exasperated at the many Chinese acts with respect to the DPRK which bear a great power chauvinist nature, both in the past and in the present. They do not accept the goals and methods of the Chinese “Cultural Revolution” and, in any event, they do not forget those massive outrages against the Korean minority which occurred in China in recent years. The Korean comrades sincerely say that they cannot understand the logic of many actions of the Chinese. “One can expect anything from the Peking leaders, including military provocations”, this is one of the recent such statements of Cde. Kim Il Sung on this subject (from a 27 July 1969 conversation with the Soviet Ambassador).There is a stratum of people in the Korean leadership who were connected with China by their past, family relations, or simply those sympathizing with the Chinese. The Korean comrades tell us about this themselves. However, the influence of the pro-Chinese elements on the formulation of policy is evidently not great and yields place to the nationalist tendencies of the majority of the Korean leaders.In the bulk of the Korean population the Chinese are called contemptuous names: “teh-nom” – (snob, swellhead, or even chauvinist) [or] “orankeh” – (savage, barbarian). The Chinese character is perceived by Koreans as furtive, vindictive, and inclined to nasty tricks. There is a saying in Korea: “A Chinese has 14 pockets, and you don’t know in which pocket he will get into right now”. Their historical enmity leaves traces on the current attitude of the Korean population toward China (in ancient times Korea was repeatedly subjected to invasions by Chinese tribes and was a vassal of China for several centuries).First Secretary of the SovietEmbassy in the DPRK[signature](Yu.

However, considerations of reciprocity hardly played the main role here, as the Korean comrades told us about this; otherwise the Korean side, quite offended by the Chinese non-participation in the celebration of the 20th anniversary of the DPRK, would not have sent so representative a delegation to Peking for the 20th anniversary of the formation of the PRC.\n",

      "[faded CPSU CC stamp: Korea 06709]SecretCopy Nº 1 SOVIET EMBASSY IN THE DPRK7 January 1969Nº 7KOREAN-CHINESE RELATIONS IN THE SECOND HALF OF 1968(memo)The process of the expansion of DPRK cooperation with the Soviet Union, as with other European socialist countries, which intensified in 1968, led to a further worsening of Korean-Chinese relations. The Mao Zedong group is evidently increasingly convinced that it will not be able to return the DPRK to the orbit of its anti-Soviet policy. Some signs of a possible Korean-Chinese rapprochement displayed in the beginning of 1968 in connection with the Pueblo incident were not subsequently corroborated.[1] The Chinese leaders now no longer display not only activity, but even flexibility in relations with the DPRK, but at times resort to actions which cause justified irritation on the part of the Korean comrades.It seems that the Korean leaders are beginning to increasingly and acutely feel the costs of their geographic and political proximity to China and, actually, take them less into consideration in determining their foreign policy. The more independent orientation of the DPRK in the international arena is being exhibited not only in an improvement of relations with the Soviet Union and the other socialist countries of Europe, but also in a striving to improve (or establish) relations with countries of the “Third World”, which have become an object of attacks from China (India, Singapore, Malaysia, and others).Nevertheless, the influence of the “big neighbor” on the position of the KWP in a number of questions relating to the international Communist movement and other fields continues to still be felt and it would be incorrect to think [handwritten in the left Who?”] that the Korean comrades will stop paying attention to the behavior of the Chinese in their policy, especially as the views of both of them on important problems of modern life sometimes coincide.Political relations. The general atmosphere of Korean-Chinese relations and the statements of the Korean leaders themselves demonstrate that, as before, there were no political contacts between the DPRK and China in the second half of 1968, not to mention the Party ties cut off back in 1965.The differences which previously existed between the KWP and Mao Zedong’s group (regarding the “Cultural Revolution”, the role of the Soviet Union and Chinese anti-Sovietism, the theory of an “Intermediate Zone”, the role of the socialist camp, and the nature of the main contradiction of the modern era, etc.) continued to remain, but some of them have become more acute. A new serious difference has appeared, in the assessment of the Czechoslovak events and the measures taken to defend the achievements of socialism in the CSSR undertaken by the Soviet Union and the other fraternal countries.The resolute actions of the fraternal countries against the intrigues of domestic reaction and world imperialism in Czechoslovakia and, at the same time, the treacherous position of Mao’s group on this question even more brought the Korean comrades to the understanding of the fact that China is essentially only obstructing the joint struggle of the socialist countries against imperialism. The Korean leadership also could not fail to note Peking’s recent steps directed at a restoration of Chinese-American contacts, and its proposals that the US construct relations on the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence. This allowed Cde. Kim Il Sung to declare in a conversation with the Soviet Ambassador on 14 December 1968, “Right now the Chinese are not waging any fight against imperialism, they just babble”.[There is a stamp at the end of the above page stating that “the material is informative and the CPSU CC Department has been familiarized with [it]; 15D/6 30 May 1969. [[two illegible names and a reference to the archives dated 30 May 1969 follow]]. Pozdnyak”.A certain shift in the Korean leadership’s approach to the problem of the reunification of the country (a reliance on revolutionizing, but not on an accelerated liberation of South Korea) is also obviously connected with the DPRK’s withdrawal from Chinese influence. For example, the Korean leaders also include the different approach to the question of the tactical line in revolution among the differences between the KWP and the CPC. “We are against conducting a revolution if the conditions are not ripe. This would be adventurism” (from a conversation between Cde. Pak Seong-cheol and the Soviet Ambassador on 22 April 1968).This evolution in views was evidently caused not only by a more realistic assessment of the situation than previously but also by the loss, to a certain degree, of hope in the Chinese aid which would be needed in an attempt to liberate South Korea. The behavior of the Chinese in the Vietnam conflict should also have undermined the confidence of the Korean leadership in obtaining the aid it needs at the necessary moment.[2]A clear sign of the aggravation in Korean-Chinese relations was the Chinese refusal to send its delegation to Pyongyang for the celebration of the 20th anniversary of the republic. As became known in the diplomatic corps, the Chinese explained their refusal by the disagreement with the request of the Korean comrades to refrain from anti-Soviet statements on this holiday, and also the Chinese approach toward the events in Czechoslovakia [being] “too different” [from that of] the DPRK. “The Chinese deeply insulted us with this step”, declared Cde. Kim Il Sung to Cde. D. S. Polyansky in September 1968. On the other hand, the sending of their delegations for the Korean holiday by the remaining socialist countries (with a certain exception) was characterized in Cde. Kim Il Sung’s 7 September report as “a manifestation of the respect for the sovereignty of the DPRK and the virtue of our nation as a bright expression of international solidarity”.A definite increase of the ideological discussion between China and the DPRK was observed in the second half of 1968 (although, as before, the sides did not name one another). In a report for the celebration of the 20th anniversary of the republic Cde. Kim Il Sung unambiguously criticized a number of aspects of the policy of the Chinese leaders. In particular, he spoke of the “mistakes of leftist excesses” which appear in the event that “reliance is placed on class struggle alone and overestimating its role, forgetting that the solidarity and cooperation of the working class, the peasantry, and the working intelligentsia [trudovaya intelligentsiya] comprise the basis of social relations in a socialist society”. Undoubtedly meaning the Chinese “Cultural Revolution” the speaker said that after the establishment of a socialist system the class struggle should be directed not at the liquidation of people, but at a reform of their ideology. He noted, “An ideological revolution ought to be accomplished not by forcible methods, as in a struggle against hostile elements, but by convincing and educating; it should become a matter of strengthening the unity and solidarity of the workers”.In the report Cde. Kim Il Sung expressed disagreement with the attacks of the Chinese leaders on so-called “economism” [ekonomizm], declaring that “it would be incorrect to consider the building of a socialist economy secondary, putting reliance solely on class struggle” and that “concern about raising the well-being of the population is the highest principle of the activity of a Party and a government of the working class”.The report also contained other factors which ought to be considered criticism of Chinese views. For example, the persistent calls to intensify the struggle against Japanese and West German militarism as a contrast to the Chinese position about an “intermediate zone”. Finally, the speaker’s statement about the role and importance of the socialist camp was an obvious contrast to the Chinese theory of the struggle of the “poor village against the rich city”.However, for the sake of objectivity it ought to be noted that the report also contained criticism of “rightist excesses”, to all appearances addressed to the European socialist countries and presented with the “orthodox” positions of the KWP.The process of improvement of DPRK relations with the Soviet Union and the other socialist countries, but also the continuing praise of the personality of Kim Il Sung causes no longer concealed irritation among the Chinese leaders. Chinese diplomats in Peking and Pyongyang have stopped considering the “special” position of the Korean comrades with respect to the open polemics and differences. At a reception at the Korean Embassy in Peking on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the DPRK Chen Yi, on the occasion of the 19th anniversary of the PRC the PRC chargé at the Chinese reception in Pyongyang, and the Chinese representative in Panmunjom made rabidly anti-Soviet speeches.[3] The substance of these speeches of the Chinese, and also the content of radio broadcasts of Peking in Korean and individual Chinese press reports touching on the foreign policy of the Soviet Union demonstrate that Chinese propaganda is trying to play on some differences in the approaches of the DPRK and Soviet Union toward a number of international problems with the goal of introducing discord in Korean-Soviet relations, for example, the problem of relations with Japan, a relaxation of tensions in Europe, and a settlement of the Near East conflict.The anti-Soviet speech of the Chinese chargé in Pyongyang did not provoke an official protest or open objections from the senior Korean guest, Deputy Chairman of the DPRK Cabinet of Ministers Ri Ju-yeon, although quite slanderous fabrications were contained in this speech, including, one must think, from the point of view of the Korean leadership. In the response speech Ri Ju-yeon spoke only with quite cautious, indirect criticism of individual aspects of the domestic policy of the Chinese leaders, stressing in particular the need for a socialist state to correct combine dictatorship with democracy, and class struggle with an increase of the unity of society and socialist development. The official reaction of the Korean comrades to this Chinese attack was only the publication of a brief a report as possible about this reception on the last page of one of the national newspapers. The Korean comrades told us that they consider it useless to protest this gaffe [vykhodka] of the Chinese chargé inasmuch as such a protest “would only amplify such a practice on the part of the Chinese” (from a conversation between Cde. Pak Seong-cheol and Cde. O. V. Okonishnikov on 7 November 1968).Korean-Chinese differences also touched on the area of the history of the 1930s fight against the Japanese. The Korean press writes that “the best sons and daughters of Korea fought for the liberation of the Chinese people”, and “helped the cause of the Chinese Revolution” in the period of the fight against the Japanese and the Civil War in China (Minju Joseon [Minju Choson], 2 July 1968), Rodong Sinmun, 25 October 1968). In the Museum of the Revolution in Kaesong the tour leaders say that in the latter half of the 1930s the Chinese Communists showed themselves as “left” opportunists in an argument with the Koreans regarding the methods of fighting the Japanese colonizers. A young Kim Il Sung is shown in a picture displayed in the Museum convincing the Chinese of the correctness of his position. Such an interpretation of history, as a Romanian diplomat who maintains contact with the PRC Embassy reported, causes strong displeasure among the Chinese, who assert that it was they who helped the Koreans during those years, and not the other way around.In the latter half of 1968 incidents continued to occur on account of a sort of “cult of incompatibility”. On 6 November the Chinese authorities in Dandong detained a Korean locomotive pulling a train across the border and painted over the slogans on the locomotive written in white paint, calling them anti-Chinese (it is known that among them were slogans about Kim Il Sung). The incident was accompanied by a brawl. In the interpretation of Minister of Foreign Affairs Pak Seong-cheol, the Chinese themselves wrote the anti-Chinese slogans on the locomotive for provocative purposes.According to the testimony of eyewitnesses, a sort of propaganda duel is being waged on the Korean-Chinese border passing along the Yalu River: enormous portraits of the leaders, billboards with political content, and loudspeakers directed at the opposite bank have been set up on both sides of the river. Chinese diplomats demonstratively do not applaud at events being held in Pyongyang (exhibits, film showings) in those places of the performances where it talks about Kim Il Sung.Events held by the PRC Embassy or the Korean comrades devoted to Chinese anniversary dates have a dry, ceremonial nature. The Chinese often lower the level of representation at their own initiative which, naturally, provokes a retaliatory response from the Korean side. The DPRK press covers these events very sparingly. It is remarkable that at a film showing in connection with the 19th anniversary of the formation of the PRC, unlike the standard practice a Korean (and not a Chinese) film, Techet reka [The River Is Flowing], was shown which was devoted, as was noted in a newspaper report about the film showing, “to the glorious anti-Japanese armed struggle under the leadership of the great leader Kim Il Sung”.In the latter half of 1968 the Korean national press noted two anniversary dates in Chinese-Korean relations with its own publications (newspaper editorials): the 7th anniversary of the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Aid (11 July) and the 18th anniversary of the entry of the Chinese people’s volunteers in the Korean War (25 October). These articles, addressed with their main content at the history of Chinese-Korean relations, were restrained in a friendly tone and on the whole not different from those for 1967. They stressed the traditions of the joint anti-Japanese struggle, noted the commonality of the tasks of both peoples in the struggle against imperialism, the role of the Treaty in the defense of peace in Asia, and the services of the Chinese people’s volunteers. The absence in the articles (as in other publications touching on China) of any mention of socialist development or the domestic situation in China was characteristic. There were no editorials devoted to the national holiday of the PRC (1 October), as there were last year. Recent telegrams which have been exchanged between the heads of the DPRK and Chinese governments on the occasion of national holidays were exceptionally short and dry.[4] The practice of exchanging congratulatory telegrams between Korean and Chinese public organizations has been halted.In general nothing is being published in the Korean press about the domestic life and foreign policy actions of the PRC. As regards the Chinese press, judging from Renmin Ribao [People’s Daily] in the latter half of 1968 only reports about ceremonial events and the telegrams of Chinese and Korean leaders on the occasion of particular notable dates were published. No other materials about the DPRK have been published in the Chinese press.The Chinese authorities are also extending some discriminatory measures to the DPRK which were previously undertaken with respect to the Soviet Union. In particular, the September 1968 halt of the delivery of Chinese provincial newspapers to the DPRK Embassy in Peking demonstrates this. This fact, although not so significant, confirms that the Chinese are irritated and single out the DPRK from the countries refusing to follow Peking less and less. As Cde. Pak Seong-cheol declared to the Soviet Ambassador, now the Chinese are also placing obstacles in the delivery of Korean military aid to Vietnam (from a 31 July 1968 conversation).In our view, the fears expressed by the Korean comrades regarding the influence of “Mao’s ideas” on the Korean population are somewhat exaggerated with the purpose of justifying the measures being taken to exalt the personality of Kim Il Sung. Individual statements by Koreans which [we] have managed to elicit from discussion[5] demonstrate that the Koreans are anti-Chinese. They genuinely reject Mao as “the leader of all peoples”, and do not accept his “ideas” and what these “ideas” are turned into in practice. It is sufficient to cite the statement of Cde. Kim Il Sung at the level of the unanimity which has been achieved in the DPRK, “Lawlessness and chaos reign in China. Everything that the Chinese are doing is scandalous. This is also a great misfortune for Vietnam, both for you and us, and for the Chinese people themselves” (from a conversation with the Soviet Ambassador on 21 June 1968). Besides the Koreans’ disagreement with the “ideas” of Mao Zedong one also ought to bear in mind their historic and national hostility. And indeed the channels of Chinese propaganda in the DPRK (as ours) are extremely limited.Evidently, the Korean leadership is not so much concerned about ideological penetration in its proper meaning as much as the possibility of direct subversive actions and provocations by the Chinese. Cde. Kim Il Sung’s statement also tells about this, “Mao Zedong hates us, the Chinese are malicious, and one can expect anything from them” (in a conversation with Cde. D. S. Polyansky on 12 September 1968). The aforementioned incident in Dandong (6 November) was characterized by Cde. Pak Seong-cheol as a Chinese “provocation, which makes us quite suspicious” (from a conversation with Cde. O. V. Okonishnikov on 7 November 1968).Trade relations. The tension in Korean-Chinese political relations and the economic stagnation in China are exerting a definite influence on DPRK trade with China.The actual volume of trade turnover between the two countries declined to 125 million rubles in 1968[6] against 135 million in 1967 and 150 million in 1966, which has led to a reduction of the Chinese share in the overall trade turnover to 25% against 30% in 1967 (on the other hand, the Soviet Union’s share rose to 45% against 43.5% respectively). The reduction of the turnover of Korean-Chinese trade in 1968 occurred due to both sides’ non-fulfillment of their obligations, the volume of which according to protocol corresponded to the actual level of 1967 (135 million rubles).In 1968 China continued to deliver to the DPRK the same (of the most important) goods that [it had] in previous years. It was (according to the obligations) to deliver in 1968 1.9 million tons of coking coal, 200,000 tons of petroleum products, 10,000 tons of cotton,[7] 1,000 tons of yarn, 20,000 tons of sugar, 200,000 tons of salt, and also rolled steel, ferroalloys, trucks, tires, and soybeans.In conversations with the Soviet Ambassador and other Soviet representatives Korean leaders have repeatedly said that, having reduced the supply of coal, China “is grabbing Korea by the throat”. Obviously, a certain reduction of the supply of coal has occurred, but evidently not to such a considerable degree as the Korean comrades have been talking about this.When visiting some metallurgical plants in the latter half of the year officials of the Soviet Trade Representative have observed that coke-oven batteries are operating with sufficient workloads.For its part the DPRK delivered anthracite (1 million tons), iron ore (300,000 tons with iron content of more than 45%), rolled steel, pig iron, non-ferrous metals, cement (100,000 tons), magnesite clinker, chemicals, machine tools, fabrics, and ginseng (the quantities indicated in the obligations) to China in 1968.In the middle of December 1968 a DPRK trade delegation went to Peking to sign the trade agreement for 1969 (the Korean experts left back in November).In 1968 China continued to provide assistance in the construction of some industrial facilities in the DPRK, including a vacuum tube plant, a textile equipment plant, and a textile mill.It is hard to say whether the DPRK is cooperating with China in the military field. The Korean comrades keep everything strictly secret that touches on DPRK cooperation with the socialist countries, especially with China.Only rumors and individual chance observations by members of the diplomatic corps tell of the existence of Korean-Chinese contacts in the military field. According to unverified data of the CSSR Embassy received from the Czechoslovak military the DPRK supposedly supplies uranium ore to China in exchange for several kinds of weapons and spare parts for them. Diplomats from various embassies have noted Chinese at the Dandong and Sinuiju border stations who, from dealings with them by border and customs authorities and other signs, might be taken as specialists with a classified specialty. Reports have appeared in the foreign press about some joint Chinese-Korean atomic research. However, it is impossible to vouch for the authenticity of all this and other data.In any event, it would be incorrect to deny the possibility of Korean-Chinese military cooperation, referring to the current tension of political relations between them, inasmuch as the interest of China itself in such cooperation cannot be denied (in the sense of the possible acquisition of strategic raw material and electric power from the DPRK for atomic research). It is known that a Chinese military delegation visited the DPRK in 1967.In the latter half of 1968, as before, there was no exchange between the DPRK and China in the area of culture, science, or sports or any contacts between public organizations.xxxAn objective commonality of views between the DPRK leadership and the group of Mao Zedong on a number of important problems of modern times, such as a relaxation of international tension and peaceful coexistence, a political settlement of international conflicts (the Near East, Vietnam), disarmament, including the attitude toward treaties prohibiting the testing and non-proliferation of nuclear weapons is being preserved with the presence of certain differences in questions of socialist development and international policy. The Korean leadership essentially shares the Chinese concept of people’s war, expressed in an underestimation of the nuclear threat; it holds to the same view as the Chinese on the development of the revolutionary movement in Latin American and other regions of the world.The Korean comrades are striving to preserve the military alliance and trade relations with China. Moreover, they obviously have grounds to fear subversive activities and provocations from China. Therefore the KWP exhibits exceptional cautiousness and patience, and strives not to give the Chinese grounds for attacks on the DPRK and all their steps in the international arena, most of all concerning the international Communist movement and support of the foreign policy actions of the Soviet Union are made with a view to China. The KWP leadership understands that participation in the upcoming Conference of Communist and Worker’s Parties would be a new, yet more serious reason for a worsening of Korean-Chinese relations (earlier the KWP’s refusal to openly speak against the Moscow meeting of representatives of Communist and Worker’s Parties in March 1965 together with the CPC was a cause).Thus, the geographic and, to a considerable degree, ideological proximity of China was and remains one of the most important factors influencing the position of the KWP and the DPRK government in the international arena.The consistent line of the CPSU CC and Soviet government for a comprehensive strengthening of the friendship with the Korean people effectively promotes the DPRK’s retreat from the ideological influence of China.Against the background of an almost complete cessation of Korean-Chinese ties each new contact of ours with the Korean comrades, especially in the area of Party, political, and cultural relations, demonstrates to the DPRK population the correctness of the Soviet Union and the majority of the other socialist countries in the ideological dispute with the group of Mao Zedong. It is clear that efforts ought to be continued which are directed at a further development of Soviet-Korean ties, especially in the ideological area, with full use of a measure of readiness for this by the Korean comrades.At the present time the establishment and expansion of contacts through Party channels in the field of culture and between public organizations takes on special urgency and importance, inasmuch as the Korean leadership itself “has come to a conclusion about the need” for such contacts, which is clear from the speech of Cde. Kim Il Sung at a 13 September 1968 reception in the Soviet Embassy and confirmed by recent practical steps of the Korean side.The peculiarities of the positions of the Korean leadership in questions of domestic and foreign policy are taken into account in our propaganda to the DPRK sufficiently completely. Taking into account the presence of a number of new aspects in Korean-Chinese relations which have been mentioned in this memo it seems advisable to intensify some aspects of our propaganda to the DPRK. Thus, in printed and verbal propaganda, and also in confidential information being passed to Korean comrades it is desirable to especially stress the efforts and initiative of the CPSU directed at the solidarity of the international Communist movement and ensuring the unity and integrity of the socialist camp, to more clearly emphasize the practical nature of the Soviet Union’s fight against the intrigues of world imperialism and its firmness and determination in the defense of the socialist achievements of each fraternal country from any encroachments; expose the false, declarative nature of the Chinese statements against American imperialism, West German revanchism, and the reactionary forces of Japan, the treacherous position of the Chinese leaders with respect to the events in Czechoslovakia, their subversive, provocative activities against individual countries and groups of the Communist movement; and continue to persistently explain the goals of our policy with respect to Japan.FIRST SECRETARY OF THESOVIET EMBASSY IN THE DPRK[signature](Yu.

The Korean guests and diplomats of the DRV, Cuba, Romania, and Albania (of the socialist countries) remained.[4] The Chinese stopped using the word “comrade” in these telegrams, which was instantly noticed by the Korean side.[5] As a rule, with the exception of the highest leaders Korean interlocutors avoid discussion of the topic of China, apparently having strict instructions on this account.[6] From here on are estimated data of the Soviet Trade Representative in the DPRK (with the lack of other references).[7] According to data of the Romanian Embassy received in the PRC Embassy - 300,000 tons of petroleum products and 20,000 tons of cotton.\n",

      "TELEGRAM  065141To: the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to comrade Constantin Oancea From: the Romanian Embassy in PyongyangSubject: the Korean QuestionDate: February 2, 1977Classification: Secret1. According to our contact with Chinese envoys and members of the diplomatic corps, there has been an increase in the level of interest and concern towards the Korean problem. The dominant note of the remarks and observations emphasize the possibility of new developments in terms of the Korean issue, determined by Sino-American relations, Sino-Soviet-American relations and by the DPRK’s recent diplomatic initiatives. 2. The US and China’s insistence on reaffirming the validity of the 1972 agreements is interpreted as being indicative of both countries’ interest in settling the complex issues in the region, chief among which [ranks] the Korean problem.  Chinese officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have informed us that China sincerely wishes for the withdrawal of US troops from South Korea and Korean reunification. It is generally acknowledged that the Sino-American solution to the problem is currently benefiting from much more favorable conditions, both in Asia and internationally, due to: a) The Carter administration’s decision to withdraw troops from South Korea. Japan analyzed the decision. However a recent discussion with Vice President Mondale reveals that, despite assurance of a gradual troop withdrawal in close cooperation with the Japanese and South Korean governments, Japan is not as of yet fully prepared to assume increased responsibilities regarding the security of the region. Japan’s concerns about the implications of the US withdrawal for regional stability and Japan’s security are also underlined by the possibility of Prime Minister Fukuda to discuss such aspects in the following meetings with President Carter. b) Changes in the DPRK’s position regarding Korean reunification:- withdrawing the proposal to discuss the Korean question at the UN General Assembly;- certain North Korean officials’ visit to countries in Asia, Africa and Europe (Premier Pak Song-chol, Vice Premier Heo Dam, Minister of Armed Forces O Chin-u and others);- clear statement of the DPRK’s wish for political contact with the US expressed during official visits (Japanese delegation received by Kim Il Sung);- proposals addressed to South Korean parties and political forces in a letter on January 25.Such changes are based on the understanding that [being in favor of] a forced military solution has undermined North Korea internationally. This approach not only produced tensions with the US, but also reservations from Chinese officials and a lack of response from the Non-Aligned Movement. Significant for this new approach are the proposals in the January 25th letter, the fundamental aspect of which is the idea of an inter-Korean dialogue – an idea endorsed by China and the US, generating wide international support. China’s prompt public support of these proposals – considered just and reasonable – and the manner in which Chinese propaganda advertised North Korea’s initiative have been notable. China’s speedy reaction confirms that it continues to play an important political and economic role in moderating North Korea’s position. c) the DPRK’s economic hardships and the impossibility of overcoming them in the near future, as well as the North Korean Premier’s recent failed attempts to receive economic assistance from the USSR, are likely to compel the DPRK to turn to the PRC and other partner countries, as well as to increase its openness towards Japan and other Western countries. 3. In our opinion, it is possible to initiate negotiations regarding the Korean question, both in terms of American military withdrawal from the South and working towards a political settlement. We believe the US and the PRC’s actions to achieve their strategic objective of removing the Korean Peninsula from Soviet influence to be determinative. Concurrently, we believe Japan to be influential as it requires time to adopt the appropriate military and economic measures in concordance with its close ties to South Korea. Therefore, this appears to be a lengthy process (according to Western estimations, only the troop withdrawal itself will go beyond 1979), with various deviations reflecting the complexity of the issue, the large discrepancies between North and South, and the assortment of conflicting interests in the region.

Oancea,The Ambassador of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is visibly showing interests within the diplomatic community in Berlin towards the significance of the statements given by the US State Secretary for Defense, according to which the US would use nuclear weapons in the eventuality of a conflict between North and South Korea.The Korean Ambassador considers the statement is meant to encourage the dictator Park in the South and spell out again the determination of US imperialist circles to maintain their influence in the area.The Korean party and government are determined to solve the issue of national reunification during “our generation,” say Korean diplomats.The Ambassador of People’s Republic of China considers there is no danger of armed conflict in Korea. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea leadership declared it aims at accomplishing its ultimate ideal: peaceful national reunification. People’s Republic of China is fully supporting this position of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.There are certain imperialist circles whose actions aim at adding an element of tension in the Far East, with the obvious intention of changing the focus from other issues and conflict areas in the Middle East and Europe.The Dutch Ambassador was of the opinion that none of the sides involved are truly interested in generating armed hostilities in the Korean Peninsula.  Signed: Georgescu C.\n",

Rogers, with whom Waldheim discussed this issue, gave him a positive answer the day after. Rogers added that it would not be difficult for the US government to grant visas to the DPRK observers.  Signed: Nicolae Ghenea\n",

      "To Comrade STALIN I.V.According to the report of Comrade Vyshinsky, reports have been published lately in French and American newspapers in Paris which underscore the inevitability of a breakdown in the peace negotiations in Korea and the possibility of broadening the Korean conflict and which lay the responsibility for this on the Korean-Chinese side (telegram No. 812).In connection with this, Comrade Vyshinsky is introducing a proposal that by the time the period for agreement about a demarcation line [expires], i.e. by 27 December, the Korean-Chinese command publish a communiqué about the course of the negotiations with an exposure of the position of the Americans, which is aimed at drawing out and breaking down the negotiations for an armistice in Korea. In the opinion of Vyshinsky, MID [Ministry of Foreign Affairs] DPRK should send such a communiqué to the chairman of the General Assembly of the UN with a request to publish it as a document of the UN and to send it to all the delegations in the Assembly session.MID USSR considers the above indicated reports of the French and American newspapers as blackmail, done for the purpose of putting pressure on the Korean-Chinese side.As regards the communiqué proposed by Vyshinsky, in the opinion of MID, it is scarcely necessary to give advice to the Koreans and Chinese on this account, since they systematically publish reports which disclose the line taken by the Americans in the negotiations about an armistice in Korea. From the other side, the distribution of a Korean-Chinese communiqué as a document of the UN will not give any practical results, and a request from the Koreans and Chinese about this can be evaluated as a sign of their weakness.In view of this, MID considers that to give any kind of advice to the Korean and Chinese governments regarding the communiqué is inadvisable.A draft resolution is attached.I ask you to review.A.

(telegram No. 188).In the draft presented by Razuvaev the interview touches on three questions: the dragging out of the negotiations by the American side; inviting representatives of the Soviet Union to a neutral organ for monitoring the fulfillment of the conditions of the armistice; the position of the Korean side in case of a breakdown in the negotiations by the American side.In the opinion of MID USSR, the proposal of Comrade Razuvaev is unacceptable. The publication of such an interview could be interpreted as a manifestation of haste and nervousness on the Korean-Chinese side. Moreover, the elements of threat, contained in the answer to the third question, could be used for accusing the Korean-Chinese side of trying to complicate the course of the negotiations for an armistice.Draft resolution is attached.I ask you to review.A.

Gromyko20 November 1951No. 334/agCopies: Mikoyan, Kaganovich, KhrushchevTOP PRIORITYNORTH KOREASOVIET AMBASSADORWe draw your attention to the inadmissibility of your actions in connection with the appeal of the Korean friends to the UN on the question of speeding up a peace settlement in Korea.You communicated only on 18 November (your No. [number is illegible]) about the intention of the Korean friends to put forth an appeal to the General Assembly and the Security Council with demands: about the immediate cessation of military operations in Korea, about the withdrawal of troops from the front line and creation of a 2 kilometer demilitarization zone and about making answerable those guilty of prolonging the war in Korea—asking if such an appeal would contradict the statement of Comrade Vyshinsky.Since we knew nothing about the proposed appeal of the Korean friends with a statement of the indicated demands, or at whose initiative arose the question of putting these demands before the UN, we asked you to elucidate (our No. 1059).Without waiting for an answer to your telegram, in which were laid out the demands of the Korean friends mentioned above, you informed us (Your No. 1353 of 19 November), that on that same day, i.e. 19 November, the text of the statement by Pak Heon-yeong [Pak Hon Yong] will be transmitted over the radio. Moreover, after receipt of our inquiry (our No. 1059), on the question of the indicated demands of the Korean friends you limited yourself only to a report that you had raised the question at your own initiative and to a repetition of the question of whether there is a discrepancy between the proposals of Comrade Vyshinsky about withdrawal of troops from the 38th parallel and agreement in Kaeseong to the point of the agenda about the establishment of a demarcation line. Concerning the appeal, you also only reported that it would be announced 19 November.Thus, both in telegram No. 1353 of 19 November and in telegram No. 1355 of 19 November, you informed us that the Korean friends will announce their appeal, even though at that time you did not have instructions from us and could not yet have received an answer to your inquiry. As a result the Korean friends made the appeal without agreement with us.In that way you acted inadmissably thoughtlessly. Your guilt is aggravated also by the fact that you did not even take the trouble to find out from the Korean friends whether they had reached agreement with the Chinese friends about the appeal to the UN with the aforementioned demands, and you elucidated this only when you had received a direct order to do so and after the Koreans had already made their statement.Learn this in the future.\n",

Vyshinsky could not speak otherwise in order to demonstrate the injustice of the USA position of refusing to withdraw their troops beyond the 38th parallel. Vyshinsky's position is advantageous to the Chinese-Korean comrades, since it demonstrates from one side the greediness of the Americans and from the other side the tractability and peaceableness of the Chinese- Korean comrades, who are making serious concessions for the sake of achieving peace.”In view of the fact that Comrade Roshchin does not have communications with you and therefore cannot fulfill through you the order about transmitting to Kim Il Sung the elucidation given in the directive of Comrade Filippov, MID [Ministry of Foreign Affairs] is sending the directive to you.Confirm receipt.Immediately telegraph the fulfillment.21.XI.51 GROMYKO21.XI.51Copies: Stalin, Copy\n",

      "BEIJING, 80. 10. 16.TOP SECRET!Created by Szi 09.40Checked by [unknown signature]CIPHER TELEGRAMSubject: China on the KWP’s 6th CongressThe Chinese attitude towards the Korean Workers’ Party’s 6th congress can be preliminarily summarized as follows:The Chinese press paid a lot of attention to the congress and the 35th anniversary celebrating the foundation of the KWP. Prior to the congress, it published a number of articles on life in Korea. On the occasion of the congress and the anniversary, Hua’s [Guofeng] letter to Kim Il Sung was significantly longer than in the previous years. The Chinese press covered the work of the congress in great detail; published Kim’s speeches almost in their entirety.The Chinese delegation was highly ranked; the Koreans are very satisfied with that. The official statements regarding the congress, and Li Xiannian’s speech in Korea confirmed that the Chinese party still attaches great importance to their relations with Korea.It is noteworthy that the stand of Li Xiannian was much sharper compared to the statements of Chinese leaders on the topic of Korea, either home or abroad. ––– for example first demanded the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of the American troops from Korea. The Chinese party considered Kim’s 10 points as a realistic plan for reunification.The Chinese press omitted the part detailing the relations to socialist countries from Kim’s speech, when he was assessing the achievements of the Korean Workers’ Party. But they published the part detailing the problems and difficulties of the party. From the coverage of Kim’s speech demanding the dissolution of the imperialist block, the Chinese press left out the ‘imperialist’ designation. It is worthy of attention that neither the greeting letter, nor the speech of Li Xiannian mentioned the juche concepts.It is also notable that the Chinese side completely ignored mentioning the friendship treaty that the two countries signed in 1961. The Chinese press published the number of parties attending the congress, but did not mention the rank of their representatives.– 152 – R. –To be seen byComrade Szabó F.Seen byComrade BényeiComrade RátkaiComrade BulyovszkyComrade HajdúComrade KrasznaiComrade Újlaki\n",

      "[…]According to the information received from the competent desk officer of the F[oreign] M[inistry] of this place, the ambassador of the DPRK officially requested the publication of government or FM statements with regard to both issues. The FM made a promise to take measures with regard to the issue of the Koreans living in Japan, but they do not intend to keep it. The CTK [Czechoslovak news agency] published the declaration of the DPRK FM, but the Czechoslovak press virtually ignored it. Due to the long time that has passed since then, they will not make a change in that; they consider the issue closed.Concerning the [April 12-14] session of the Supreme People’s Assembly, the ambassador asked for propaganda support primarily with regard to the South Korean elections, mainly “for describing the huge demonstrations of the patriotic forces,” by which he meant the student demonstrations in Seoul. The FM was of the opinion that of his requests, only the holding of a small student meeting was feasible; they do not intend to take further steps with regard to this issue either.The desk officer said that they [the Czechoslovaks] are increasingly worried that parallel to the consolidation of its internal economic situation, the DPRK is again coming closer and closer to the Chinese standpoint. Several signs indicate that in Czechoslovakia the DPRK Embassy is assuming the role previously played by the Chinese Embassy. In recent months the embassy’s propaganda activity has multiplied, and in several cases it took an aggressive form. For instance, they inundate a wide variety of social and state institutions, and even private persons, with a mass of materials mailed in provincial post offices, using lists of addresses that were collected from telephone directories. In the letters attached to the ideological materials, they invariably ask the addressees to reply. They also multiplied their trips to the countryside, which they do by evading [the control of] the FM. Taking the aforesaid issues into consideration, the desk [recently] started drawing up a plan for restrictive measures to be prepared on the basis of mutuality.[…]– 245 – Vince –\n",

The presenter was Comrade Kim Il Sung, Chairman of the Central Committee. The Plenum marked the date of the 4th Party Congress in 1961 September 11.Comrade Pak Jeong-guk, the leader of the Central Committee Foreign Division informed the ambassadors about the work of the plenum on March 17 (see my referenced report). He said the following concerning the 4th Party Congress:Great changes have taken place in the party and the country since 1956 March, since the 3rd Congress of the Workers’ Party. Men are no longer exploiting other men, the socialist production way has been victorious in all areas of the economy. The country has a significant socialist industry, and they have finished the socialist transformation of agriculture as well. They have successfully completed the first five-year plan before its deadline; other sister countries have provided great support for this as well. Fractions inside the party have been eliminated, unity has been solidified. The whole working nation is firmly gathering around the Central Committee led by Comrade Kim Il Sung; the party’s “direction of the masses” and “people-centric workstyle” policies have triumphed. There seems to be advancements in the issue of unifying the country as well, the South Korean people have chased away Rhee Syngman, and demanding the reunification without any foreign influences more and more actively. The South Korean colonial rule of the American imperialism is facing a catastrophe.The 4th Congress of the Workers’ Party – said Comrade Pak – will be the “congress of victors” that summarizes the results achieved so far, and determines the next goals. Delegations of sister parties will also be invited to the congress. Regarding this, Comrade Pak noted that “the sister parties can encourage us in our work by sending delegations of good composition”.Comrade Pak did not talk about the agenda of the 4th Congress as the newspapers have not published that yet.

Therefore the Hungarian translation was done by the embassy on its own based on press materials.The delay of the requested materials was due to the aforementioned reasons.Kovács JózsefAmbassadorThe report of the Korean Worker’s Party 4th Congress Credential Verification Committee:(The chairman of the committee is Kim Ik-seong.)In the introduction of the report, Comrade Kim Ik-seong briefly talks about the achievements of the party since the 3rd Congress. He highlights that the party has eliminated the conspiracies of the anti-party and anti-revolutionary reactional elements, and by improving the work of the party, it has become a firm, indivisible bastion.The representatives participating in the current congress and the representatives with debate rights faithfully defend the policy of the party, and they have become the nodes of the party for realizing its policies.The Central Committee of the party decided that they would elect 1 representative after every 1000 party members, and similarly 1 representative with debate rights after 1000 party member candidates. Based on this decision, 1160 and 73 members were elected respectively during the appointing sessions. On the appointing sessions, every district (city) elected the leader of the party, Comrade Kim Il Sung, in unison as their representative. The Credential Verification Committee determined that the election of the representatives with voting and debate rights during the appointing sessions went completely according to the rules and regulations of the party. Therefore all of the currently present representatives possess full mandates.In the current session 99.7% percent of the representatives, 1157 members participated. 3 people could not attend the congress due to reasons concerning their work or illness.Analyzing the composition of the representatives participating in the congress, we can determine that 57.7% were workers, 4.1% were soldiers, 27.3% were peasants, and 11.6% were employees (students as well).The fields and professions of the representatives:Patry workers                                                                             384 people (33.1%)From government organizations                                                    202 people (17.4%)Social organizations                                                                     40 people (3.4%)From industrial, governmental and state areas                               326 people (28.1%)Besides these:Workers                                                                                     255 people (22%)Agricultural cooperative member                                                  100 people (8.6%)Trade                                                                                         10 people (0.9%)Scientific, educational, cultural and health fields                             27 people (2.3%)People’s Army                                                                             71 people (6.2%)9 comrades are twofold Chollima heroes.113 new representatives are present from heavy industry, 54 from light industry, 17 from fishing, and 18 from building industry. This means that since the 3rd Congress, the number of new representatives present have increased even more (by 193 members).This proves how greatly the working class has increased thanks to the correct economic policy of the party. It is especially important that after the collectivization of the agriculture, the elected representatives from agricultural fields are all party members from state or cooperative farms.The age of the representativesUnder 29 years        59 people (5%)From 29 to 49 years   1015 people (87.5%)From 50 to 59 years   74 people (6.4%)Above 59 years        13 people (1.1%)Representative members who entered the party:   From before the liberation:                                 57 peopleBetween 1945 August 15 and the unification of the party:    366 peopleUntil 1950:                                                 546 peopleDuring the war:                                             151 peopleAfter the war:                                              40 member83.6% of the representatives have been party members for more than 10 years.Comrades who entered the party after the 3rd Congress:      25 people20.% of the representatives (234 people) have a university degrees, 64.4% (746 people) graduated from a party college.

(The agenda involves the modification of the Party Rules.)According to a night broadcast of the South Korean radio that is aimed at the North, Kim Jong Il is the one behind taking custody of the “anti-party elements”. For example Comrade Kim Dong-gyu, former member of the Central Committee Politburo, and former foreign secretary of the Central Committee, was arrested in 1977 on his instructions. (Comrade Kim Dong-gyu had good relations with the Vietnamese leaders.) I looked into similar statements of the South Korean radio, and except for their propagandistic statements, factually they are mostly true.Monitoring the internal political life of the DPRK, it is apparent that a new movement has started in the recent few months: “learn from the examples of unanimous heroes”. In the framework of preparing for the congress, this movement is linked with the “three red flag movement”, which was initiated and advocated by Kim Il Sung’s son.In relation with the aforementioned, I would like to highlight the contents of my no. 135 open telegram.Based on conversations with our Soviet friends as well, I think it is likely that there has been no decision so far in appointing Kim Jong Il as the official successor. This is currently only in a preparatory stage. (According to my information, Kim Il Sung did not say anything concrete during the last Central Committee session about how the Korean Workers’ Party’s Party Rules should be modified.)It is also worthy to note that according to my information, O Jin-u is in a very good relationship with Kim Jong Il.I am asking that only the leaders concerned should be informed about the aforementioned, the apparatus should not be yet.– 42 ––E. –To be seen by Comrade Szabó FerencSeen by Comrade Rátkai\n",

They wish to legitimize the KWP’s policy by the presence of a large number of highly ranked guests.Local friendly mission leaders expect a meaningful answer only in the question of succession. It is worth mentioning that the editor in chief of the Rodong Sinmun told the leader of Pravda’s recently visiting delegation: the classical figures of Marxism made a mistake when they did not address the issue of a proper succession of their cause.This problem will be solved by Comrade Kim Il Sung, by learning from the mistakes of others, in a satisfactory manner.

Their released joint statement was published in Korean daily newspapers in its entirety.The Soviet ambassador informed me that the recent talks were the continuation of Comrade Kim Yeong-nam’s Moscow negotiations last year. Around this time the Soviet side informed the Koreans in detail about the Soviet assessment of all timely international issues (including the Soviet support to Afghanistan, and to the countries of Indochina, etc. as well as the policies of the current Chinese leaders), and about the willingness to versatilely improve the Soviet-Korean interparty and interstate relations.Comrade Kim Yeong-nam expressed his gratitude for the Soviet support so far regarding the reunification policies of the KWP, but expressed his dislike this time for the South Korean presence at international events held in the Soviet Union.He asked the Soviet Union to dissociate itself from South Korean entries and “cross-recognition”. Comrade Grishin repeated the known Soviet standpoints regarding this topic, and asserted that the Soviet side considers the issue permanently closed with this.The KWP is also ready, said Comrade Kim Yeong-nam, to improve the Korean-Soviet relations.Comrade Kim Yeong-nam commented only generally on the international situation. He did not even address the issues of Afghanistan, Indochina, or China, saying that the Soviet party knows the standpoint of the KWP very well.Comrade Kim Il Sung received the Soviet party delegation for a three-hour talk and lunch after it. Here, Comrade Grishin briefly summarized the points he made during the negotiations, to which Comrade Kim Il Sung listened attentively.Comrade Kim Il Sung expressed his gratitude for the continuous moral and financial support of the Soviet Union since 1945, and for the efforts of the Soviet experts currently working in the DPRK. He greatly appreciated his last meeting with Comrade Brezhnev in Belgrade. He envisaged fulfilling the previous invitation of Comrade Brezhnev next year sometime around spring or summer. He cannot travel to the Soviet Union earlier.Comrade Grishin brought up the subject of China before Comrade Kim Il Sung as well, highlighting the collaboration of current Chinese leaders with the most reactionary imperialist circles, and how they were growing closer to the United States, Japan, etc.Comrade Kim Il Sung valued China as a fighting companion, stating that China has provided and still is providing great assistance to the DPRK, furthermore there is an active collaboration between the two countries currently as well.The Korean side would like the Soviet Union to improve the interparty and intergovernmental relations with the DPRK. Comrade Kim Il Sung evaded the Soviet response to this subject with the promise that they would continue the conversation during lunch, but he did not give such an opportunity there.According the Soviet evaluation of the KWP’s congress and negotiations, there are no essential changes in the Korean Workers’ Party’s internal, external, and reunifications policies. The politics of the KWP can be described as maverick, pragmatic, national, and divergent from socialism as well as Marxism-Leninism.Despite this, according to the evaluation of the Soviet delegation, versatile relations with the DPRK have to be maintained and improved in areas where possible.From the experiences of the delegation, Comrade –riulin highlighted two:1)  There is military order, discipline in the country; they built a lot.2)  Consternation is the defining experience due to nationalism, pragmatism, and dissociation from the Marxist–Leninist ideologies (juche). – 175 E. –To be seen byComrade Szabó F.Comrade Dr. Tóth J.Seen byComrade BényeiComrade RátkaiComrade BulyovszkyComrade ÚjlakiComrade HajdúComrade Krasznai[Translation notes: Comrade –riulin might refer to Comrade Firiulin.]\n",

(Our friends have also experienced the disabilities in the guidance of the colleagues assigned to the delegations as well.)Our Vietnamese friends disliked the fact that their delegation could not participate in the grand meeting, and that recently the Korean press reported the greeting telegram of Pol Pot that he addressed to Kim Il Sung on the occasion of the 35th anniversary of the KWP’s foundation. (The local Pol Pot-ist ambassador attended the congress along with the other mission leaders.)The Vietnamese and Cuban comrades expressed their dissatisfaction about the low rank of the Korean leaders accompanying and hosting them.

The meeting could have been possible if Comrade Wojtaszek had stayed after the congress.

They are equivalent to the positions of secretary general and secretary respectively.Members of the 11-member Political Bureau are:Kim Il Sung, Choe Yong-geon, Kim Il, Park Geum-cheol, Lee Hyo-sun, Kim Chang-man, Park Jeong-ae, Kim Gwang-hyeop, Jeong Il-yong, Nam Il, Lee Jong-ok.Kim Ik-seong, Lee Ju-yong, Ha An-cheong, and Ha San-du have been elected as alternate members.From the previous Political Bureau, only Comrade Rim Hae was left out. He was first the Foreign Trade, then the Agricultural Minister. Rim Hae did not appear in public during the last couple months at all. We have heard from various trusted sources that during summer in a session of the cabinet, Comrade Kim Il Sung was criticizing Rim Hae: despite being a member of the Political Bureau, he did not fully understand the policy of the party, and his progress was lagging behind the events as well. He also had failed to adequately spread some of the modern agricultural methods prescribed by the party. After all this, Rim Hae did not participate on the 4th Congress, and has not been appointed as a member of the Central Committee either. Instead of him, Comrade Lee Jong-ok, Chairman of the Heavy Industry Committee, and Vice Prime Minister, became the eleventh Politburo member, who had only been an alternate member of the Politburo previously.Vice Chairmen of the Central Committee are: Choe Yong-geon, Kim Il, Park Geum-cheol, Kim Chang-man, and Lee Hyo-sun. Here, there has been only one change in personnel: instead of Comrade Park Jeong-ae, Comrade Kim Il, the first deputy of the Prime Minister has been elected as a Vice Chairman (Secretary) of the Central Committee. Comrade Park Jeong-ae has been previously involved in agriculture in the Political Bureau. She was elected as Agricultural Minister right before the 4th Congress in place of the dismissed Rim Hae, and it was expected that she would not keep two leading positions (Politburo member, and Central Committee Vice Chairman).Pyongyang, 1961 September 20\n",

      "EMBASSY OF THE HUNGARIAN PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC217/1961Presenter: Fendler KárolyTop Secret!Pyongyang, 1961 September 23Reference:  Report on job offeringsProduced in 2 copies for:-   Central (2 copies)-   Embassy (1 copy)Subject: Celebration of the Korean Worker’s Party’s 4th CongressThe central aspects of the life of the DPRK’s internal affairs since announcing the convocation of the 4th Party Congress (1961 March) were naturally its preparations. In our referenced report we have already covered the work race that was taking place in honor of the congress. This time I only wish to talk about the events etc. that were related to the congress.The 16th anniversary of the liberation, August 15, were celebrated very modestly this year in Korea. No parades or processions were held, but by moving the Sunday holiday to a different day, they held a three-day long general public holiday. Not holding celebrations were explained due to the congress by the Korean comrades. After closing the congress, they were planning to hold a monumental procession, and they did not want to – understandably – organize processions, decorations, etc. twice in a very short period of time.In honor of the congress, Pyongyang, and almost the whole country too, took on a festive look. In barely a few weeks, Pyongyang’s main roads were equipped with mercury-vapor lamps, and larger public buildings and monuments were decorated citywide with electric garlands. Many electric signs and slogans were installed, and all these gave the previously rather grim capital a rather impressive look. Many shops mainly selling food and public necessity products had opened throughout the city, with a significantly greater and much wider variety than before. From a sanitation point of view the city had already painted a positive picture due to various cleaning movements in the past as well, but this time it could have competed with any big city in the world.We know from various sources that general preparations for the congress had been discussed during party members’ and other meetings. Most of the population were wearing their glad rags during the congress. The cars of the delegations were received with all kinds of cheering, and hand waving, and during their visit to Pyongyang and countryside facilities (factories, villages, etc.), the delegations of the 32 sister parties who attended the congress were greeted with almost indescribable enthusiasm.In my opinion, this was obviously not just an “issue of organization”, but a rather serious and significant political, proletarian international demonstration as well. I have already informed the Central about the cultural and sport events directly connected to the congress in my previous telegrams detailing these, and now as a conclusion, I would like to say a few words on the grandiose mass demonstration that was held on the occasion of the closure of the congress and the visits of foreign delegations.There has been nothing like the September 19th 300-thousand mass demonstration and colorful procession in Korea before. The several-hour-long procession was not only imposing in its size, but was a rather positive and successful political expression of the results that the Korean people have achieved so far, the future perspectives, and the power and unity of the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union. The foreign delegations seated in the grandstand, the leaders, and delegates of the congress were continuously applauding at the marching, imaginative mockups, and slogans. The processions was closed by the disciplined thousands of the Korean Worker’s militia units.On the same day during the evening, on the Central Committee reception, fireworks were held for approximately 30 minutes, which was, in its size and technique, a worthy closure for the celebrations organized in the honor of the 4th Congress. (I will mention it here that the Mongolian comrades invited Korean firework technicians for the 40th anniversary of their revolution, who organized the Ulaanbaatar fireworks.)Kovács JózsefAmbassador\n",

      "EMBASSY OF THE HUNGARIAN PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC223/1961Presenter: Fendler KárolyTOP SECRET!Pyongyang, 1961 September 25Produced in 2 copies for:-   Central (2 copies)-   Embassy (1 copy)Subject: The Korean Worker’s Party’s 4th CongressI will not discuss the preparations of the congress, or the grandiose congressional race movement encompassing the entire working Korean nation in this report. I am merely trying to provide brief information about the congress itself.The lower organs of the Korean Worker’s Party elected 1160 delegates to the congress based on the principle of 1 delegate after 1000 party members.There were many attendants in the congress room (new opera house). Besides the delegates of the 32 sister parties, the foreign representative leaders of the Korean diplomatic missions, state and party officials, journalists, press reporters of friendly countries, etc. were present. Every seat was taken in the room where more than 2000 people can be seated.The agenda of the congress was the following:1)  Report of the Central Committee, presenter: Comrade Kim Il Sung.2)  Report of the Central Control Committee, presenter: Comrade Kim Gae-rin.3)  The seven-year plan to develop economy, presenter: Kim Il.4)  Election of the party’s leading organs.The Korean Worker’s Party’s 4th Congress was opened on September 11 by Comrade Choe Yong-geon. The congress sessions were held for 8 consecutive days, and it was closed on September 13 afternoon by Comrade Choe Yong-geon again after the closing speech of Comrade Kim Il Sung.The 6-hour long report of Comrade Kim Il Sung was accompanied by recurring applause from the delegates, expressing their full agreement with the party’s political direction.More than 5 years have passed since the Korean Worker’s Party’s 3rd Congress, and as Comrade Kim Il Sung said in his report: The Korean nation accomplished its grand historical task in North Korea, completed the socialist transformation of the country in cities and towns as well, and thus laid the foundation of socialism. The Korean working people have achieved great successes in developing industry, agriculture, culture, and the entire economy. The five-year plan was completed in only two and a half years; they have invested more than 2 billion won for developing economy, and for cultural building. During the last plan period, industrial production increased with yearly 36 percent. After the socialist transformation of agriculture, their main objective was to increase the irrigated fields. Currently from the available 2 million jeongbo (1 jeongbo = 0.98 hectares) arable land, 800 000 jeongbo is irrigated. A compulsory 7-grade school system was introduced in 1958, and currently they are preparing to introduce a compulsory 9-grade system. Currently 97,000 students are studying in the 78 universities and colleges of the country. From 1956 until 1960 the national income increased 2.1-fold.The majority of the speakers particularly emphasized the unity of the party, which had purified itself from elements that are revisionist, dogmatic, or do not belong to the party. The Korean Worker’s Party has never been as consolidated and unified as today. The party has tight connections with masses outside of the party. The party has a huge member count with 1 million 311 thousand 563 members and candidate members. It controls the activities of the whole Korean working nation through its party organizations that reach into every residential area of the country. The results that they have produced in the last 5 years are eloquently proving that the entire Korean people line up tightly around its party.A large portion of the speeches dealt with the education of the people in the communist spirit. A great driving force in creating the new socialist man is the so-called Chollima Movement. This is roughly equivalent to our socialist work brigade, but it is more than that. There are Chollima brigades in every plant, cooperative, office, etc. of the country. With the help of these, they are motivating the workers to do a better job, and for a large-scale production boost. Among others, Comrade Kil Hwak-sil has spoken out on the congress, colleague of the Pyongyang Textile Factory, and the winner of three Chollima awards. She mentioned three working brigades that she elevated to the Chollima standards. In some plants, 70-80% of the workers are working according to the Chollima methods. Comrade Kim Il Sung said the following about the Chollima Movement in his report:“And thus the Chollima Movement has become the grand movement of millions of workers that triumphed over everything that is outdated in economic, cultural, ideological, and moral life. It constantly creates something new and accelerates our social development in an unprecedented way. This is our main direction in building socialism in our party.” (Page 37 in the Report)As a result of the construction of socialism, the numbers of the working class have increased. The workers and employees currently make up 52% of the residents of the country. As the report states, the working class, as the holder of the power, was leading the whole nation with an unwavering determination on the path of the socialist building and completed its grand revolutionary objective: eradicated the exploitative society.The development achieved in the northern part of Korea has a great effect on the South Korean people living under the occupation of American imperialism. Just as Comrade Kim Il Sung did in his report, most of the speakers mentioned this issue as well. All of them demanded the withdrawal of the American imperialist troops from South Korea and the reunification of the country as soon as possible. The congress addressed the South Korean situation and the issue of reunification in a separate decree.Comrade Kim Il Sung only broadly outlined the seven-year plan for developing the country. Comrade Kim Il was the one who gave detailed information about it. The main objective of the seven-year plan is to further develop the base of the country’s industry, greatly raising the people’s standard of living, further fortifying the socialist society, and continue the fight for the peaceful unification of the country. The party considers its basic task to continue accelerating its development in heavy industry, and at the same time wants to achieve the development of light industry, agriculture, culture, and science. According to the seven-year plan, the heavy industry will increase 3.2-fold, and the light industry 3.1-fold. The total investment is estimated to be 7 billion won. If we add the expenditures of the cooperatives that they have to finance from their own resources, then the investment estimate becomes 8.8 billion won.The industrial growth is set to be 18% a year. The major control numbers of the seven-year plan:Steel production      2.2 – 2.5 million tons (1961 approx. 790 000 tons)Cast iron             2.2 – 2.5 million tons (1961 approx. 960 000 tons)Electric power        16 – 17 billion kilowatt-hours (1961 approx. 9.7 billion kilowatt-hours)Coal                  23 – 25 million tons (1961 approx. 12 million tons)The 1961 numbers were taken from Kim Il Sung’s report.They wish to increase the agricultural crop yield 2.4-fold during the seven-year plan. The plan prescribes that new areas of 1 million jeongbo have to be converted to arable fields. They have great plans for mechanizing agriculture as well. At the end of the plan, there will be 3.2 tractors for every 100 jeongbo of arable land. They wish to increase the national income 2.7-fold in those seven years. Culture and science will also develop greatly. Besides factories, they will pay a lot of attention to create middle and higher education institutes, and to increase the number of students in evening and correspondence courses. The salary of working fathers will more than double throughout the plan.Talking about the foreign relations of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, in his report Comrade Kim Il Sung emphasized the leading power of the Soviet Union, the great achievements of the Soviet science and engineering, and the huge effort that the Soviet government is making to ensure peace. He primarily highlighted the importance of the assistance that the Soviet Union and China gave to Korea, but also listed the other socialist countries as well whose support largely contributed in restoring the economy after the war, and laying the foundations of a socialist industry. Many congress speakers also stressed the assistance that the socialist countries provided to Korea.The party delegations of the socialist countries were received with a warm welcome. The Korean leader comrades, led by Kim Il Sung, have greeted personally all of the delegates at the airport and the railway station. On the second day of the congress, Comrade Kozlov, the leader of the Soviet party delegation held his speech, then the Chinese delegation leader as well. The other delegations were given a chance to speak on the third day of the congress in the order of the Korean alphabet.The Korean Worker’s Party’s 4th Congress is a big historical event for the Korean workers in building socialism, and in the ongoing fight for reunification. The unity of the party and the whole Korean nation, and the limitless trust in the leadership is a guarantee that the objectives marked in the seven-year plan will be fulfilled.Kovács JózsefAmbassadorAttachments:Decree of the 4th CongressControl numbers of the seven-year planManifesto for peaceful reunificationThe speech of Comrade Kim Il SungThe speech of Comrade Kim IlThe record of Comrade Fendler on the changes of the Korean Worker’s Party Central Committee\n",

      "EMBASSY OF THE HUNGARIAN PEOPLE’S REPUBLICSerial number: 275/1980Produced in 3 copiesCentral: 2 copiesEmbassy: 1 copyTyped up by Nemes GabriellaTOP SECRET!Pyongyang,1980 September 26Subject: Preparations of the KWP’s 6th CongressThe representatives of the parties and political circles of friendly countries are looking forward to the Korean Worker’s Party’s forthcoming 6th Congress with a heightened interest. This goes without saying as it has been 10 years since the last assembly of the highest ranking forum in the political life of the party and the country. Significant changes have occurred during these ten years both worldwide and in the regions neighboring the Korean peninsula: changes in China and its relations with the United States and Japan above all, not to mention those that have taken place in South Korea as well. Judging from our current knowledge however, it seems that there will be no considerable changes in the Korean’s political orientation at the 6th Congress of the KWP, aside from some possible formal elements.The statement above is especially true for the internal policy. All signs point towards the fact that instead of a “work congress”, this will be a kind of celebratory festival in the spirit of personality cult and the juche ideology, where they will praise the results achieved in the last ten years, especially during the nationwide campaign in honor of the congress, announced as the “hundred-day battle”. This is also supported by the statement of Vice Prime Minister Jon Jun-gi before the journalists of the GDR, where he said, so to speak, that “they have taken the stronghold of ideology” (i.e., the juche ideology has won) and “the fight for the material stronghold is in progress”. He also added that they had produced more until the end of August than during the same time period of the previous year.The work oriented nature of the congress seems to be also denied by the fact that they have not published the guiding principles of the congress, unless we consider the congress slogans published in June as the directives. Thus there were no possibilities for the party members to disclose their opinions about the principles in the frame of representative sessions or to make their suggestions, therefore the protocol of the congress could not be prepared reflecting the concise opinion of the party members as a whole.On the other hand, the festival nature of the congress is supported by the ambitious work-race campaign: the “hundred-day battle”, whereby they want to complete the yearly economic plans three months before the deadline, i.e., before the congress. The timing of the congress also corroborates this. They scheduled the congress along with the 35th anniversary of the foundation of the KWP, and for months now they have been preparing a mass demonstration on a scale unprecedented in the DPRK: ordering tens of thousands of youths to the streets and public squares every evening until late night hours.The “hundred-day battle” requires almost inhuman performances of the workers. This is especially apparent in the capital, where massive prestige constructions are taking place (e.g. the 170-meter-tall Juche Monument, the “Grand People’s Study House”, building roads, and other urban planning actions). They told the local Czechoslovak diplomats that youths working with them go to construction sites after their office hours and work there until 1-2 AM. Thus they are only left with a daily 4-5 hours of sleep. This “undertaking” is generally true almost everywhere and is an irrational outbidding.They are expecting more than a hundred delegations to the congress and to the party anniversary celebrations following it. They have invited “high ranking” delegations from the parties of socialist countries. Not only communists will be present, but also representatives from all the parties the KWP liaises with. Besides party representatives, representatives of various “juche seminars” and “juche circles” will attend as well. They will be transported by private planes into and back from the DPRK.Concerning the contents of the congress, the only significant event besides celebrating the achievements seems to be the public appointment of Kim Il Sung’s son, Kim Jong Il, as the number two leader, which is basically just the public endorsement of the current practice. As a Central Committee secretary, he supervises the two most important areas of the party: organization and propaganda work; and acts as the number one executive of the party politics through them. The Korean comrades are unwilling to tell us his official prospective function, so there are only guesses among the local diplomatic circles concerning this. The strongest view is that Kim Il Sung will exercise his “leader” roles as the president, whereas his son will be given the position of general secretary of the party. Our Korean partners refused to either confirm or deny this even after direct questions. In their words, the “Great Leader” holds the ideological, theoretical leadership, while Kim Jong Il controls the execution of party politics, in other words he will be the “executive leader”. It is a fact that the Korean senior officers are talking more and more openly about Kim Jong Il, even in front of foreigners, as “their nation’s Dear Leader”, who is the originator, director, and organizer of the “hundred-day battle” and the preparations for the congress and the anniversary celebrations.The last ten years prove that congresses do not play any decisive role in the life of the KWP and the DPRK, as they serve only for endorsing the politics created by a narrow political group, and not for discussing, developing, and introducing meaningful political directions suitable for the new circumstances. So it seems probable that the 6th Congress will not change the practice of the KWP’s traditional, bureaucratic leadership scheme either.Pataki SándorTemporary Charge d’Affaires\n",

      "EMBASSY OF THE HUNGARIAN PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC5/6/Szt./1980Produced in 3 copiesCentral: 2 copiesEmbassy: 1 copyPresenter: Thürmer GyulaTyped up by Gergely A.TOP SECRET!Moscow,1980 October 22Subject: The Soviet press on the KWP’s 6th CongressThe Soviet press, mainly the Pravda, covered the Korean Workers’ Party’s 6th Congress in detail.The Pravda published the greeting telegrams of the CPSU Central Committee, and Comrade L. I. Brezhnev, wrote on the progress of the congress, and the Soviet-Korean negotiations. They reported on the congress in around half a newspaper page, and printed the speech of V. V. Grishin in full.The papers did not write about the other parties attending the congress, or about Kim Il Sung’s opening or closing speeches. Information about this can be found in internal materials of the TASS (Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union).One fourth of the summary of the congress report reviews the achievements so far and sums up the additional tasks, half is about the Korean reunification, and the last quarter discusses international issues. It lists the economic achievements numerically, and mentions the successes in education. From the future objectives, it highlights boosting the economy and converting the cooperative property into national property.It does not mention the principle of self-dependent development (juche), the road of the Korean revolution that is said to be straight and crisis-free, or the “revolutionary lifestyle”. There are also no remarks on the seemingly extreme ideas for industrial development either.The summary publishes the proposed suggestion for Korea’s reunification almost word-by-word with certain abbreviations. It is conspicuous that they used the expression “neutrality” instead of the original “independence”.The external policy section highlights the positive Korean standpoints on the necessity of avoiding a new world war, and the issues of military blocks and nuclear-free zones. Quoting the original text almost word-for-word, the following is emphasized: “The socialist and the non-aligned countries should not make unprincipled compromises with the imperialist countries. Naturally, economic and cultural exchanges are permissible… But they cannot… sacrifice the fundamental interests of the revolution. They cannot give up the anti-imperialist point of view, they cannot forfeit the interests of other countries for the benefit of good interstate relations…”It is also mentioned that the DPRK develops its relations with the socialist countries based on principles of proletarian internationalism. The word “independence” however is omitted here as well.In the summary of the international part, there is no mention about the statements concerning the Korean interpretation of the content of our time, the harmful role of the superpowers, or the “absence” of unity between socialist countries.There are absolutely no words on chapter 5 of the congress report, which is about the party. From the information available in the press, the nature of the personnel change can only be understood by experts.He described the tasks marked at the congress as “grand”. The reunification program, according to him, is “appointing a realistic way of solving this important national issue”. He emphasized: “we are in solidarity with the fight for the withdrawal of the USA forces from South Korea, and the peaceful, democratic unification of the country.”The speech did not acknowledge the role of Kim Il Sung.Speaking of the friendship of the two countries, he stressed the role of the Great October Socialist Revolution, and the common fight for liberating Korea and building socialism. According to the speech, “the Soviet Union was very satisfied” with the Belgrade summit this year. The two countries are on common grounds in most of the issues concerning the fight against imperialism, the struggle for peace, softening, freedom, and independence of the nations.From the international topics, V. V. Grishin spoke especially of the cooperation of the socialist countries, Afghanistan, the intentions of the Japanese imperialism, the disarmament, the joint suggestion of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, and finally the unity of the communist movement. China is only mentioned as “other reactionary forces”.The speech calls the advanced socialism that has been built in the Soviet Union as the “greatest achievement of the present-day social progress”. He emphasizes the role of living standards policy, democratic political system, and national unity.On the occasion of the congress, various other materials were published as well. In the Ekonomicheskaya Gazeta (issue 43), V. Gaidukov, the department head of the GKESZ highlights the role of the Soviet Union in the Korean industrialization. The third issue of the Problemy Dal'nevo Vostoka is about the liberation of Korea; factually reviews the achieved results, and underlines the importance of interparty relations. The October 1 issue of Krasnaya Zvezda supports the Soviet standpoint in the issue of reunification.In summary, we can state the following:- The Soviet press covered the events of the 6th Congress in detail, though the scope was less than usual for the case of sister parties among socialist.- The CPSU is clearly trying to avoid public arguments with the Korean party. Similarly to before, the tone of the published materials is factual. Ideological questions are not mentioned, one can only infer the discords in political practice. Publishing this way expresses the endeavors of the CPSU to make the sister party and the DPRK grow closer to the countries of the socialist community.- There are no signs of change in the Soviet perception of the Korean politics.- There are also no signs of change in the Soviet standpoint regarding the issue of reunification either.  Dr. Szűrös MátyásAmbassador[Translation notes: Could not find what GKESZ stands for.]\n",

A report to Kim Il Sung was received from the ambassador of the DPRK in the Chinese People's Republic Ri Ju-yeon [Ri Ju Yon] in which he reports about a meeting between Mao Zedong and Ri Ju-yeon that took place in Beijing at the end of March 1950.In the conversation between Mao Zedong and Ri Ju-yeon, at the initiative of the latter, the question of a meeting between Kim Il Sung and Mao Zedong was discussed.Mao Zedong responded positively to the question of a meeting with Kim Il Sung and selected the end of April or the beginning of May of this year as the approximate time for his meeting.Mao Zedong connected the proposed meeting with the question of the unification of Korea, indicating in this regard that if there is a concrete plan for the unification of Korea, then the meeting should be organized secretly [not openly], but if there is not yet such a plan for unification of Korea, then the meeting with Kim Il Sung can be conducted officially.Ri Ju-yeon has not given a concrete answer to the question of the time and form of the meeting, referring to the fact that Kim Il Sung is presently undergoing medical treatment. Further, Mao said in the conversation with Ri Ju-yeon that if a third world war begins, Korea will not escape participation in it, therefore the Korean People's Democratic Republic should prepare its armed forces.In the conversation with Ri Ju-yeon, Mao Zedong expressed the wish to develop wider trade between the Chinese People's Republic and the DPRK.2. Kim Chaek has reported that Kim Dal-seon [Kim Dal Son], the leader of the partisan detachments in the south of Korea whom the southern press and radio have repeatedly officially reported as killed in battles with punitive units of the South Korean army, arrived in Pyongyang from South Korea on April 3.Kim Dal-seon came to North Korea to report about the position of the partisan movement in South Korea and to receive orders on this question.Kim Chaek asked me to transmit the above indicated questions to Kim Il Sung through Comrade Shtykov.10.IV.50.

Relations between the US and South Korea are currently less tense than when President Carter announced the decision to withdraw American ground troops from South Korea. The tension at the time was a product of the sudden manner in which the drawback was announced, without prior consultation with the South Korean and Japanese authorities. Subsequently, however, following discussions with American officials, the ROK came to terms with the idea of US troop withdrawal despite preferring otherwise. The Carter administration reassured the ROK that the drawback will not damage the military balance in the Peninsula and that the US will help strengthen South Korean forces in order to effectively replace US troops. The most delicate part of the issue is now in the hands of the US administration which will have to make serious efforts to persuade Congress of the opportunity for withdrawal and the need to offer additional military assistance to the South Korean government – in particular, loans for acquiring military equipment. Troop withdrawal has been another contentious point between the administration and Congress, which recently decided that every troop reduction in South Korea must have explicit Congress approval. Congress opposition against troop withdrawal is due to the large number of Congressmen who believe the drawback will instigate aggression from North Korea and, therefore, alter the fragile military balance in the region. 2. Recently, a move towards the idea of a bilateral meeting with the US has been noticeable in the DPRK’s conduct. Also notable has been the manner in which the North Korean authorities solved the recent helicopter incident, leaving a good impression. Nonetheless, the US administration believes it would be detrimental to positively respond to the DPRK, as long as the DPRK intends to avoid South Korean participation in future talks. The DPRK’s recent decision to establish a 50-mile militarized zone in the ocean is considered unilateral, arbitrary and against the armistice. The US administration has not managed to fully decipher the intent behind this decision, particularly since it did not affect the supply to several islands in the zone. The US Department of State tends to believe that the decision is simply the materialization of a Third World conference on maritime law.3. The US has no knowledge of the DPRK’s intentions regarding the next UN General Assembly. However, the State Department believes that the current international scene is not favorable for introducing a pro-North Korean resolution due to the ‘scandal’ regarding North Korean diplomats’ illegal currency dealings in various countries, as well as to the American decision to withdraw ground troops from South Korea, which is likely to reduce, if not eliminate, attacks against the US.

      "TELEGRAM  085099To: the Romanian Ministry of Foreign AffairsFrom: the Romanian Embassy in PyongyangSubject: the Korean QuestionDate: August 18, 1977Classification: SecretG. Helman, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for International Organization Affairs, mentioned the following: 1. Recently, North Korea envoys have begun approaching the US again with the proposal of organizing bilateral meetings in view of discussing the situation in the Korean Peninsula. The US responded in concordance with its established position that it cannot accept such a proposal as long as the participation of South Korean officials is excluded. 2. Presently, the US has no knowledge of the DPRK’s intentions to reiterate its well-known resolutions at the next UN General Assembly. However, the US does not exclude the possibility that the DPRK will act around certain states in order to cause conflict at the 32nd Assembly based on these resolutions. If this were to happen, the US will proceed in the same manner it has thus far and ensure that a sufficient number of votes will overturn such resolutions. 3. The US administration is careful not to trigger negative reactions in Pyongyang and, therefore, proceeds in a prudent manner, leaving the DPRK to believe that the US is in favor of a joint dialogue with the two Koreas. As such, Helman emphasized that President Carter places great importance on avoiding tensions in the Korean Peninsula. Signed: Gh. Ionita\n",

      "DIARYAmbassador of the USSR in the DPRK, Cde. Ivanov V.I.19 AprilI visited Kim Il Sung and gave him the telegram from the CPSU CC with thanks for the invitation to the Third Party Congress.Later I informed him that the CPSU CC approved the order of the formation for May 1st demonstrations. It was considered useful to decorate Red Square and other locations of workers' demonstrations, and also the party committee buildings with the portraits of Marx and Lenin. Participants will march in columns carrying portraits of Marx, Lenin, and leaders of the Communist Party and the government of the USSR and portraits of leaders of communist parties and governments of the Peoples' Republics.Moreover, participants in the demonstration will be given the opportunity to carry portraits of Stalin and other figures at their own discretion.I said that I told him this in order to keep him informed. Kim Il Sung thanked me for informing him.Later, having explained to Kim Il Sung that Korean comrades twice visited our head advisor from the KGB and were interested in his thoughts regarding the Soviet position on carrying out the death penalty in relation to [former DPRK Foreign Minister] Pak Heon-yeong, I said to him that according to the Soviet position, it would be advisable to refrain from such measures in relation to Pak Heon-yeong, keeping in mind that from the moment the sentence was pronounced, a lot of time has passed and that Pak Heon-yeong is politically ruined, isolated, and that carrying out the sentence now might lead to undesirable repercussions both in Korea and also abroad.Having listened to my thoughts about that, Kim Il Sung was clearly perturbed and vexed. He indicated that, even in his time, Ambassador Suzdalev inquired with regard to the situation of Pak Heon-yeong, but no answer followed from Moscow and we considered that the matter of Pak Heon-yeong to be of no concern to Soviet interests. I was obliged to explain that even now the Soviet position is not interfering in the matter of Pak Heon-yeong, I was only expressing my opinion in connection with the visit of Korean comrades to the head advisor from the KGB. In this case it would be expedient to act taking into consideration the present situation, which speaks in favor of the corresponding stance.Kim Il Sung said that the comrades who were interested in the thoughts of the head advisor of the KGB on the Soviet position on the future condition of Pak Heon-yeong, acted on their own behalf at the same time there exists a party decree to carry out the sentence in relation to him. Kim Il Sung noted that he will find out why that decree has not yet been carried out since a month and a half has already passed since Pak Heon-yeong was required to describe some additional circumstances, that the order was given to the MIA [Ministry of Internal Affairs] to carry out the sentence.An open trial was conducted in relation to Pak Heon-yeong, he said, and there are no grounds or signals about the incorrect conduct of the affair. He admitted to all crimes he was accused of, both in the preliminary investigation and in court; he is a spy and the death sentence will be carried out. The Korean people unanimously approve and there will not be any undesirable consequences abroad.Kim Il Sung said that his personal feelings have come to this; that it is necessary to carry out the sentence and there is no need to reconsider. But since there are other thoughts on Soviet appeals, we will discuss these circumstances in the Political Council.\n",

IVANOVfor the period from 4 through 15 December 1955Pyongyang 195501263[…]12 DecemberI received Chinese Ambassador Pan Zili. The latter reported that on 9 December he had received a telegram from his government that the Swedish and Swiss governments had informed the Chinese government of their proposals to reorganize the Neutral Armistice Supervisory Commission in Korea. Pan Zili pointed out that on 3 November that Swedish Minister of Foreign Affairs Unden had informed Zhou Enlai, and on 25 November the Swiss representative [had informed] the Chinese envoy about their proposals on this issue. He said that the Swiss government does not plan to withdraw from participation in the Neutral Commission inasmuch as, in the opinion of the Swiss government, it benefits the maintenance of peace in Korea. However, the position of the Commission should correspond to the work which it performs. Like the Swedes, they consider their proposals useful. If they are not accepted they will leave the Neutral Commission or the US and South Korea will take steps to abolish this Commission.He expressed satisfaction that mutual understanding with representatives of the military authorities of North Korea is satisfactory, but it is hard to perform work because of insufficient monitoring abilities and numerous restrictions.Then he pointed to the fact that it is necessary to think so that the membership of the Neutral Commission is an odd number so that decisions can be made.The Commission also should have more rights so that it can take certain steps and have a practical opportunity to implement them.Then Pan Zili reported that the PRC government was studying these proposals of the Swedish and Swiss governments and not yet informed him of their own proposals. In reply to my question, how does he regard these steps, Pan Zili replied that he thinks that one could examine the issue of some reduction of the personnel of the Neutral Commission in order to ensure unanimity of the sides in the Commission, without bothering and without violating the international agreements on the basis of which the Neutral Commission exists. I agreed with this, saying that this is my personal opinion.Pan Zili reported that he will also visit Nam Il and pass him the substance of the question reported to me.[…]SOVIET AMBASSADOR IN THE DPRK [signature] (V.

      "Handling the Korea Issue at the UNShowa 47 May 101.\tThe handling of the Korea Issue at the United Nations should be thought of as one part of the Korean Peninsula policy of Japan. It is Japan’s Korean Peninsula policy to encourage the reduction of tensions on the Korean Peninsula by promoting the establishment of a North- South relationship of coexistence. The implementation of this policy can be summarized in the follow way.I.\tRegarding the Republic of Korea, promote friendly and cooperative relations focused on economic cooperation so that, through economic development, livelihoods can be stabilized and the foundation of democratic nationhood can be strengthened.II.\tRegarding North Korea and various interactions with them, we should observe and flexibly deal with North-South dialogue, such as the North-South Red Cross discussions, and other international developments. This should be done while also promoting friendly and cooperative relations with the Republic of Korea.III.\tAs far as possible, promote the reduction of tensions on the Korean Peninsula through the promotion of North-South relations. At the very least, Japan should not an obstruction towards the reduction of tensions.2.\tThe Korea issue vis-à-vis the United Nations should be dealt with in the following way.1.\tProactively shelve the Korea IssueThrough developments in the North-South Red Cross dialogues, it can be seen that there recently is an increasing mutual effort being made between the North and South to solve the Korea Issue on their own without being swayed by great nations or third parties. However, when at the United Nations, both sides inevitably insist on unnecessarily sticking to their principles and assume very confrontational postures.Given that there is the possibility that direct dialogue may become obstructed, for the time being, strive to postpone UN deliberation on whether or not to entrust the North and South with solving the Korean Issue on their own.2.\tThis argument for proactively shelving the Korean issue is different from the proactive shelving of the UN invitation issue from last year, which was in actuality intended to avoid a disadvantageous vote. For the reasons given above, in this current case, shelving the issue has merits for both North and South, as well as the respective countries that back them. In cooperation with the Republic of Korea (this must be discussed beforehand with the Republic of Korea), lay the groundwork among the major countries at the UN before striving to convince the North and South to both agree (or at the very least acquiesce) to shelving the issue.3.\tSuccess of shelving the issue at base depends on the attitude of North Korea. The inclinations of North Korea should be sounded out through, for instance, Romania (for example, by making use of the opportunity of Ceausescu’s visit to Japan). In addition, if necessary North Korea is to be reached through the Soviet Union (if possible through the United States during the United States-Soviet Summit) or China (through, for instance, the United States).4.\tWhile laying the ground work towards proactively shelving the issue, we should work accordingly to bring the members of the UN General Assembly on our side as a way to bolster the effort to shelve the issue and as a precaution in case we cannot gain North Korea’s approval to shelve the issue (to effectively convince North Korea to abandon its insistence on deliberating the Korea issue at the UN by convincing the General Assembly to take our side).5.\tIn addition, if it is the case that the North and South cannot reach mutual consensus on shelving the issue, changes in the situation should be closely observed and considered.3.\tThe Korean Issue and the conditions of the Korean PeninsulaA.\tConditions on the Korean Peninsulai.\tImplementation of the Nixon Doctrine and closer US-China relations have greatly impacted the Korean Peninsula, as place where the interests of Asian countries, including the United States, China and the Soviet Union, have numerous entangled interests. Both North and South Korea have recognized the new situation and are struggling and groping for measures to deal with the changed circumstances.Even under the current circumstances of international politics, the winds of détente are blowing and the heightened tensions seen in 1967-1968 no longer exists. Provocations from the North have ceased as such since 1969, and today they are close to none. Tensions on the Korean Peninsula are likely more psychological rather than something that is actual.While neither the North nor South have strayed from their fundamental posturing, under the backdrop of détente, both sides appear to be gradually becoming more flexible and there are indications that they are searching for an autonomous solution to the Korea issue. The Red Cross dialogues between North and South has progressed since September of last year, and it is not an absolute impossibility that this may lead to governmental talks.However, for both the North and South, recognizing that there indeed still exists a state of tension appears to take precedence. There is strong, mutual mistrust between the North and South. At this stage, this situation cannot be easily remedied. Therefore, it will require quite a lot of complications and plenty of time for the reduction of tensions to become established on the Korean Peninsula.ii.\tThe Park Chung Hee government has moved on to implementing the third Five-Year Plan, following after the first and second Five-Year Plans. It is worth paying attention to the achievement of economic development through the government’s maintenance of a stable foundation throughout the implementation of the Five-Year Plans. However, in recent years the many stresses owning to rapid economic development are beginning to show. Pressing issues that must be resolved include disadvantageous balance of payments, faltering business confidence, rising prices, a lagging agricultural industry, and fragile domestic resource mobilization systems. These economic stresses, coupled with the prevailing mood of détente, are factors that contribute to political issues and social uncertainties.The declaration of a state of emergency of last December was done so with the domestic circumstances described above as a background. It appears that the intention was to effectively tighten domestic control and in doing so overcome varying economic and political difficulties. Since the state of emergency, the Park government has taken a committed posture, as seen, for instance, in the New Village movement. However, it is too early to predict whether it will produce results. Looking ahead to the presidential election scheduled for 1975, the next few years will be a consequential period of trial for the Park government.On the occasion of China regaining its seat the United Nations, North Korea has determined that international circumstances are shifting in their favor and are placing the utmost effort in continuing this momentum to further increase their international standing. Although North Korea’s diplomatic activities have already been gradually becoming more active since 1971, the scale of their activities between February and March of this year has been unprecedented. North Korea’s enthusiasm in approaching Japan and the United States is more noteworthy than their diplomatic activities in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, which are intended to elevate their international standing.Since the partial purging of the military clique between 1968-69, the Kim Il Sung government has succeeded in consolidating power and on the whole has achieved stability. At the moment, the greatest obstacles faced by North Korea are economic. North Korea has extended its Seven Year Plan by three years. In actuality, it has taken 10 years to achieve the planned objectives in 1970. It is presumed that the reason for the three-year extension was because they unsparingly prioritized military strengthening. Until now, North Korea has relied on self-reliance and the, so called, ‘Chollima Movement’ to serve as the drivers of economic development. However, this has inherent limits. Reforming North Korea’s industrial structure is unavoidable if its economy is to develop any further. This is why the threefold technological revolution is a central heading under the 1971 Six Year Plan. North Korea cannot help but turn to democratic countries, particularly Japan, for the acquisition of technological innovation, as they cannot rely on communist states, such as China and the Soviets, in this regard.B.\tThe Korea Issue under the United Nationsi.\tAt the moment, we are primarily exchanging opinions and collecting information with friendly states, especially the Republic of Korea and the United States. We are not at a point where we can make a final determination on how to develop policies to cope with this issue. Given the progress of the North-South Red Cross dialogues and the heightened sense that both sides wish to resolve  the Korea issue on their own without being swayed by large or third-party countries, and with the intention of supporting the decrease of tensions on the Korean Peninsula, it is desirable that we try to postpone or adjourn the deliberation on the Korea issue. In addition, we should support, and at the very least not obstruct, the dialogue between North and South. It is also desirable that we avoid as much as possible the usual recriminations that are hurled between the respective supporters of the North and South.ii.\tWhether deliberation can be postponed or not depends on the disposition of North Korea and the actions of the Soviet Union and China. However, last year even the backers of North Korea have expressed their recognition of the importance of the North-South Red Cross dialogue. Given this, it would be favorable that we secure a postponement of deliberation through dialogue between the respective supporters of the North and South. In order to convince North Korea about postponing the deliberation, as well as to prepare for the possibility that a confrontational vote becomes inevitable, it is critically important that we gather general committee members to our side. Similarly, we have become a general member and are running for the chair of the Fifth Committee, which is a committee of national interests as it deals with budgetary and human resources matters. (In this regard, it is encouraging that New Zealand has announced its candidacy as the vice-chair.)iii.\tIf the postponement of deliberation is not successful, the usual debates will inevitably be repeated. At any rate, as long as we do not lose the invitation issue, we can prevail in this issue with a narrow majority vote, although we would be at a slight disadvantage compared to before. However, it should be noted that the current circumstances do not warrant optimism regarding the proposal to unconditionally invite both North and South to the United Nations. Given that, we believe that it may be necessary to take a flexible approach and entertain alternative proposals (reference material attached), such as the New Zealand proposal of last year, or to consider allowing the unconditional invitation ofNorth Korea as circumstances develop. We would like to continue to exchange views on this issue.iv. In any case, we would like to maintain close coordination centered on the UN, and maintain close collaboration on this issue.

      "Ciphergram No. 4098Dispatched from Havana on 03.24.1962 at 18:00 and received at 03.25.1962 at 14:53Came to the Decoding Department at 03.25.1962 at 19:30To: [Director General Jerzy] MICHALOWSKI, EYES ONLYFrom: [Ambassador Boleslaw] JELEN1I. I am relaying the information presented today by Blas Roca2 and Emilio Aragonés [Navarro]3 (secretary of the ORI [Organizaciones Revolucionarias Intergradas4] to the heads of the diplomatic posts of the countries of the socialist camp. They asked that we relay this information to the central committees of [our] parties.On the 22nd of this month, the national leadership of the ORI made a decision to exclude Anibal Escalante from the leadership of the ORI. A. E. remains a member of the ORI, but he’s been removed from all the leadership positions.[They said that the] motives [for the removal of Anibal Escalante were as follows]: as an organizational secretary of the ORI, A. E. used brutal and arbitrary methods of management, as well as intrigues aimed at concentrating control in his hands over the party and national apparatus. He used these methods towards other comrades regardless of their previous organizational membership [that is, whether they belonged to the former Popular Socialist Party or the “26th of July Movement”]. He managed to [take] control of a series of ministries, among others, the Ministry of Internal Affairs; he undertook the steps in order to control the military cadres. A. E.’s arbitrary behavior could be already be detected in the 1940s, when he served in the leadership of the Popular Socialist Party, and later [when he was active in] the underground and [finally] after the collapse of the [Fulgencio Batista]5 dictatorship. Various circumstances did not allow for putting an end to [Escalante’s behavior] during these different periods.The discussion related to the activities of A. E. began in February of this year under the older leadership. The resolution from the 22nd of this month was adopted without the participation of the new members of the current leadership (which was approved on the 8th of this month – see our Claris6 54), all of who did not participate in the previous phase of the discussion. [The resolution] will be presented to the public by Fidel [Castro]. The discussion focused only on [issues such as Escalante’s] work methods and organizational matters, and not on the ideological issues. The [Cuban] leadership will, unconditionally, adopt methods of collective leadership. They will hold meetings once a week under the current composition (24 members). The secretariat meets daily regarding [making] current decisions. They accelerated the process of creating the Revolutionary Party Cells (the equivalent of our POP [Basic Party Organizations]). They have not openly carried out their activities everywhere until now; the[se] activities were predominant in workplaces, especially among the management and administration. The membership selection to the Revolutionary Party Cells will be carried out strictly by taking political and moral aspects into consideration. The party will be composed of the cadres and it should count no more than 10 thousand members. The [party] congress will take place no earlier than at the end of the year.There will be changes in the positions of provincial committee secretaries in four provinces (there are six provinces overall [in Cuba]). [These changes] are not connected with the activities of A. E., and they are a result of the weaknesses [exhibited by] some of the current secretaries.In order to streamline [the work of] some departments, there will be some changes in the leadership. The most significant change pertains to the position of the minister of internal trade, because the poor organizational situation in the area of distribution. These changes do not have any political background (see our Claris 69 – [Manuel] Luzardo – from the former Popular Socialist Party, Celia Sanchez – Fidel’s secretary until now).There is going to be a change regarding the position of the head of the Security Department in the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Brahantes is the one who is holding this position; he is a secretary and Fidel’s aide.II. In our Claris 67, we have already reported that the members of the “26th of July Movement”7 are numerically predominant in the secretariat and the commission. The only one from the former Popular Socialist Party8 who is currently a member of the secretariat is Blas Roca (the function of the organizational secretary is fully held by [Emilio] Aragones). As far as the organizational commission, only Luzardo remains [as the member of the former Popular Socialist Party]), and L. Pena holds a position in the syndical commission. III. The information, which I presented in the first point of this cable, was relayed separately and individually to the ambassadors from the USSR, the PRC, and Albania, all of whom were not invited to the general meeting [of socialist countries]. [The North] Korean [ambassador] sent his secretary even though he attended a party soon before the meeting. The charge d’affaires represented the [North] Vietnamese embassy.IV. Anibal Escalante – an old member of the leadership of the Popular Socialist Party and its long-time organizational secretary. He worked for the Comintern and represented the Popular Socialist Party at the conference of 81 [communist and workers’] parties.9 After the formation of the ORI, he served as the organizational secretary. He joined the new leadership of the ORI that was approved on the 8th of this month.[1] Poland’s Ambassador to Cuba (1961-1965).[2] Blas Roca (1908 – 1987), a leading theoretician of the Cuban Revolution and the leader of the former Popular Socialist Party.[3] Emilio Aragonés Navarro (1928 – 2007), one of the original members of the 26th of July Movement; friends with Ernesto “Che” Guevara.[4] Organizaciones Revolucionarias Integradas was formed in July 1961 following the Cuban Revolution and the fall of the Fulgencio Batista regime. The ORI was comprised of the members of the revolutionary organization called the “26th of July Movement” of Fidel Castro, the Popular Socialist Party of Blas Roca, and the Revolutionary Directorate of March 13th of Faure Chomón Mediavilla. On March 26, 1962, the ORI was transformed into Partido Unido de la Revolución Socialista de Cuba (PURSC). In 1965, the PURSC was transformed into the Partido Comunista de Cuba (PCC) which exists to this day.[5] Fulgencio Batista y Zaldívar (1901-1973) served as Cuba’s president twice: 1940 – 1944 and 1952 – 1959.[6] Claris is an embassy/consular letter reporting on information included in the press.[7] “The 26th of July Movement” – movement led by Fidel Castro that overthrew the regime of Fulgencio Batista in Cuba in 1959. After Castro’s victory, the movement was integrated into the Organizaciones Revolucionarias Integradas (ORI) in 1961.[8] The Popular Socialist Party (Partido Socialista Popular) was formed in 1925 by a group including Blas Roca, Anibal Escalante, Fabio Grobart, and Julion Antonio Mella. It was later merged into the Integrated Revolutionary Organizations (ORI), the precursor of the current Communist Party of Cuba.[9] The November 1960 Conference of the Representatives of the Communist and Workers’ Parties was attended by delegations from 81 countries and took place in Moscow.\n",

      "As we already reported in an open telegram, Kim Il Sung–in the presence of the members of the KWP Presidium and several other high-ranking leaders–received Cuban Ambassador Vigoa, who will leave the DPRK in the immediate future. Following the reception, Kim Il Sung gave a luncheon in honor of the Cuban ambassador. In the opinion of several fraternal ambassadors, this honor given to the Cuban ambassador reflected the close relationship between the Korean and Cuban parties.According to the information received from GDR Ambassador Comrade Horst Brie about the conversation that took place between Comrades Kim Il Sung and Vigoa, it was the following parts which were the most significant:Kim Il Sung praised the right policy of the KWP Presidium, which was also justified by the present events. He considered the international situation as well as the situation of the Communist and workers’ movement extremely complicated. Speaking of the Korean-Chinese relationship, Kim Il Sung stated that it was very problematic, and he referred to the Chinese provocations that had become known recently. Evidently referring to the [alleged] conflict between [himself] and Kim Gwang-hyeop that the Red Guards were spreading rumors of, Kim Il Sung jokingly remarked that Kim Gwang-hyeop was sitting alongside him, participating in the conversation, and that it was obvious what this meant. During the conversation Kim Gwang-hyeop made anti-Chinese remarks. Among others, he declared that he knew the current Chinese ambassador to Pyongyang well since they had fought together against the Japanese for a long time, and [he knew] why [the ambassador] was now under attack. (Comment: as we already reported, according to the information we received from Mongolian sources, the work of the current Chinese ambassador to Pyongyang, who has not been here for a long time, has been criticized at home.)Kim Il Sung spoke disapprovingly of the activity of the Chinese embassy here, pointing out that the latter carried out anti-DPRK propaganda among the ethnic Chinese people living in the DPRK. The Korean comrades were indignant with the provocations committed against the Korean embassy in Beijing. Kim Il Sung said that they [the Chinese] planted signs in front of our embassy saying: Brezhnev and Kosygin should be roasted in their own fat.” We understand what these and similar attacks mean! With regard to the issue of the glass display case [set up by the Chinese embassy in Pyongyang], Kim Il Sung stated that the behavior of the Chinese was not compatible with the principles of proletarian internationalism and one should instead declare it a bourgeois nationalist action. Speaking of the well-known behavior of the new Albanian ambassador, he stressed that the latter, though he had not spent more than a few days in the DPRK, once more put the photos that had been removed by the Albanian chargé d’affaires ad interim into their glass display case. This is hostile behavior, a step unworthy of a fraternal ambassador!Kim Il Sung considered Korean-Cuban relations to be very good. He stated that the latter was characterized by close friendly cooperation and that the views of the two parties were completely identical. The KWP fully supported the standpoint of the Cuban Communist Party. As an example, he noted that the KWP supported only those Latin American revolutionary movements which the Cubans also agreed with and which they supported.During the conversation, Cuban Ambassador Vigoa asked a few questions. For instance, he inquired about the Korean-Yugoslav relationship and the possibility of establishing diplomatic relations [between Pyongyang and Belgrade]. Kim Il Sung answered the question concerning the establishment of diplomatic relations in the negative, and pointed out that the Romanians had similarly proposed the establishment of relations, and the Soviets also found that useful. (Comment: A few days after the conversation between Kim Il Sung and Vigoa, the Korean press published a long anti-Yugoslav article based on Japanese sources.)Comrade Vigoa inquired about the Korean comrades’ opinion regarding the Soviet standpoint concerning the agreement on nuclear non-proliferation. It became clear from the reply of Kim Il Sung that they did not agree with it, but would not attack and criticize it openly.In another part of the conversation Kim Il Sung made mention of Mao Zedong. Pointing at Choe Yong-geon, who was present, he stated that he was the same age as Mao, yet his state of health was better and his mind was also livelier. Although at that time [in 1957], as opposed to [the First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union] Khrushchev, Mao Zedong had apologized for his earlier interference in the internal affairs of Korea. By now “Mao Zedong has made twice as many mistakes as Khrushchev did” - said Kim Il Sung.   With regard to the question of unity in the international Communist and workers’ movement, Kim Il Sung said that he saw two possibilities. One is that the small countries, on the basis of their collective action, persuade the two big ones, that is China and the Soviet Union, to restore their unity and cooperation. The other is that the two big countries reach an agreement “on their own,” without the help of the small ones. Of these two possibilities, it is the first one that is realistic, whereas the second one seems unrealizable.István Kádas(ambassador)\n",

      "(Translation)Stamp: Archive of Josip Broz Tito[Translator’s note: per the Serbian-language comments at the top of the document, this is a translation of the original Korean document into Russian]TO JOSIP BROZ TITO, THE CHAIRMAN OF THE UNION OF COMMUNISTS OF YUGOSLAVIA, THE PRESIDENT OF THE FEDERATIVE REPUBLIC OF YUGOSLAVIADear Comrade Josip Broz Tito,First of all let [me] warmly greet the 10th Congress of your Party.Noting with great joy that the relations of friendship and collaboration between the Parties, governments, and peoples of our two countries are developing well with each day in various fields I send you and in your person your Union, Government, and the Yugoslav people, cordial, fraternal greetings.I express to you, Comrade Josip Broz Tito, my gratitude for receiving the delegation of the Supreme People’s Assembly of our country which visited your country not long ago, and [that you] expressed the inspiring words that you, the League of Communists, and the Government of Yugoslavia would henceforth pursue comprehensive activity in the international arena as a sign of support to the great cause of our people in the name of the unification of the Motherland. Through Comrade Yang Hyong-sop, who took part in the 10th Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, I would like to inform you of the new measures recently adopted by our Party in connection with the question of the unification of the Motherland and to exchange opinions with you about some views of ours regarding the Third World and the Non-Aligned Movement.As one of the founders of the Non-Aligned Movement, you are making a great contribution to the cause of strengthening and developing this Movement, and your valuable opinions would serve as a great help in our work.I express confidence that the close relations of friendship and collaboration which have developed between the Parties, governments, and peoples of both our countries will henceforth be tirelessly strengthened and developed on the basis of the principles of Marxism-Leninism, equality, independence, mutual respect, non-interference in the internal affairs [of one another], and comradely collaboration, and from the bottom of [my] heart I wish you good health, happiness, and new successes in your responsible work.With comradely greetings,GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE KOREAN WORKER’S PARTY, PRESIDENT OF THE DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF KOREAKIM IL SUNGPyongyang, [date left blank] May 1974[Translator’s note: this message follows the above, without any date or salutation:](Translation)Permit me to express to you, Comrade Josip Broz Tito, [my] deep appreciation for the fact that you have devoted the time and have warmly received our delegation, in spite of your great workload.First of all let me pass to you, Comrade Josip Broz Tito, the Chairman of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and President of the Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia, a comradely, friendly greeting from the General Secretary of the CC of our Party and President of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Comrade Kim Il Sung.The Central Committee of our Party is grateful to the Central Committee of your Party for the kind invitation to our Party delegation to take part in your Party Congress.Comrade Kim Il Sung values the fraternal friendship and solidarity with the Union of Communists and the people of Yugoslavia.This time, in sending us, Comrade Kim Il Sung has given us convincing insistence to promote the further development of friendly relations between the Parties and peoples of both countries, which are developing productively.He also charged [us] with paying a visit to you, Comrade Josip Broz Tito, and talking about some of the following questions.With your permission, right now I would like to pass to you the words of Comrade Kim Il Sung addressed to you, Comrade Josip Broz Tito.Dear Comrade Josip Broz Tito!Through Comrade Yang Hyong-sop, a member of the Political Committee and Secretary of the CC of our Party, who took part in the 10th Congress of your Party at the invitation of the CC of your Party, I want to tell you of the new measures recently taken by our Party and government on the question of the reunification of Korea, and also about the position of our Party associated with the Third World and the Non-Aligned Movement.First I would like to briefly touch on our proposal about the conclusion of a peace agreement with the US.As you probably already know, in March of this year at the fifth convocation of the 3rd session of the Supreme People’s Assembly we decided to hold talks with the US in order to conclude a peace agreement and sent a letter about this to the US Congress.Now in order to eliminate the tension in Korea and speed up the peaceful reunification of the country it is first of all necessary to eliminate the state of military confrontation between the North and South and replace the Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement.However, the whole course of the dialogue between the North and South shows that the south Korean rulers do not want a reunification of the country and do not intend to eliminate the military confrontation between the North and South or to conclude a peace agreement. In trying to consolidate the current situation of a division of the country into North and South and manufacture “two Koreas” they, on the one hand, are increasing the fascist repression of the south Korean population and, on the other, are feverishly making new military preparations against the northern part of the Republic.Such criminal actions of the south Korean puppets are being made under the active instigation of the United States. The US continues to give the south Korean rulers weapons and military equipment, they are expanding military bases in south Korea, and continually conduct military exercises together with the south Korean puppets.Without the elimination of the US interference in the internal affairs of Korea it is impossible to achieve either a durable peace in Korea or the independent peaceful reunification of our Motherland.However, the south Korea rulers not only have no intention of removing outside forces but they also are completely unable to do this.As the whole world knows, the right to command the south Korean army does not belong to the south Korea rulers but to the Commanding General of US troops, who is there under the name of “the Commanding General of UN Forces”, and it is the American troops deployed in south Korean who have the right to command the various weapons and military equipment. It is clear that in these circumstances it is impossible to decide either the question of the elimination of tension and the securing of peace in Korea with the south Korea rulers or any other question connected with the reunification of the Motherland. That is why we want to hold talks directly with the US, which has the actual right to decide the question of the replacement of the armistice agreement with a peace agreement and which is one of the actual interested parties which signed the Armistice Agreement in Korea; thus, to achieve the withdrawal of American forces from south Korea and to create preconditions for the solution of the question of the reunification of our Motherland with the efforts of the Koreans themselves.We have proposed including the following in a peace agreement which would be concluded with the US: both parties are commit themselves not to attack one another; the US will commit itself to neither protect or incite the south Korean rulers, and not obstruct the peaceful reunification of Korea; both parties should stop building up [their] armed forces and the arms race; foreign troops there under the label of “UN forces” should be withdrawn from south Korea, and Korea will not become a military or operational base for any other country after the withdrawal of the foreign troops.In the final account, the peace agreement which we advocate is directed at the liquidation of a constant hotbed of war in Korea and the elimination of outside forces, the main obstacle to the reunification of our country.We unalterably insist that in no event can the question of the reunification of our country be decided if we hand it over to bargaining between the great powers.A direct approach to the US with a proposal to hold talks will give us the opportunity and more strongly take the initiative in our hands on the question of the reunification of our country.If the US authorities have no intention of pursuing a policy of division and war then they cannot have any excuse or reason for not agreeing to hold direct talks on the question of the conclusion of a peace agreement.In our opinion, our proposal about holding direct talks with the US will also be productive for exposing to the entire world that the south Korean rules are traitors to the Motherland and puppets without any real power, which will further isolate then in the international arena.At the present time the south Korean rules are very worried that the US will enter into talks with us without taking them into consideration, and are shrewdly trying to obstruct this in every possible way.We think that if the US does not continue to support such a bastard as Park Chung-hee, rejected by the people as an inveterate fascist unprecedented in the history of the East or West, and enters into talks with us without delay, then a new way out of Korea will open for the US itself without shame.It is a matter of whether the US will make changes to its policy with regard to Korea or not.If, as before, the US relies on such a person as Park Chung Hee to pursue the goal of perpetuating national division and the fabrication of “two Koreas” and preserving the colonial fascist dominance, then the people of south Korea will not just view this indifferently.When the south Korean people rise up in revolt and ask us for help, then we will not be able to sit with folded arms. The struggle of the south Korean people is a just struggle for freedom and liberation, and our active support of their revolutionary struggle is a proper national duty.In such an event it appears that such a danger is not excluded of the US again being drawn into such events in Korea as occurred in Vietnam.We think that before such a turn of events that the US should abandon the aggressive policy with respect to Korea and enter into dialog with us beforehand, which would also completely meet the interests of the American people, who oppose war and love peace.I would like to express my confidence that you, Comrade Josip Broz Tito, will put pressure on the US and make use of your influence to mobilize world public opinion to implement our even-handed proposal to hold direct talks with the US.Further, I would like to express some considerations with respect to increasing the strength of the peoples of the Third World.Today the peoples of the world are taking the course of independence, which has become an invincible trend of the time.In particular, the peoples of the Third World, who in the past were subjected to exploitation and oppression from the imperialists, have strongly taken their fates in their own hands and are acting as the masters in a historic arena. We think that today the countries of the Third World are the main strength of the world revolution.But some powers nevertheless do not see the changed reality and, striving to continue dominance of the world, are trying to manage the fates of the countries of the Third World.We think the countries of the Third World need to even further strengthen solidarity under the banner of independence in order to be saved from dominance and control from outside.In fact, the Third World comprises a large number of countries and population, has a broad territory and many natural resources, and therefore we think the Third World can accomplish anything and restrain any great power if only they unite.When the countries of the Third World rationally mobilize in unity and use their potential then, in our opinion, they would make the anti-imperialist forces several times stronger and exert an ever more decisive influence on the development of the international situation.The UN General Assembly session held recently on the question of raw materials and development convincingly demonstrated the united power of the peoples of the Third World who are fighting for independent development. We insist that the peoples of the countries of the Third World ought to firmly band together to ensure a durable peace in the entire world and the security of humanity, break up the old procedure of international relations established in the interests of the great powers, and affirm a new way of international relations meeting the interests of the peoples of the Third World.We think that it is important not only to strengthen the unity and cohesion of the peoples of the countries of the Third World, but to also free such countries of the Second World as France, Japan, Canada, and others, which are subjected to their pressure from the influence of the great powers so that they do not blindly follow these powers.It is true that France, Japan, Canada, and the other countries of the Second World have relations of alliance with the US and common positions with it, but on a number of questions their interests are not identical.In addition, these countries do not have sufficient natural resources, so that they rely on the rich resources of the countries of the Third World for the development of the economies of their countries. Although they assert that the developing countries cannot live without their “help”, in fact they are not able to live without the fuel and raw materials of the countries of the Third World. The energy crisis, which enveloped the capitalist world as a result of the vigorous measures of the Arab countries adopted in connection with the war in the Middle East in October of last year, eloquently tells of this.If the countries of the Third World make skillful use of such adversarial relations between the powers and their weaknesses then, in our opinion, they could win over the countries of the Second World and form a united front with them.As it seems to us, if the countries of the Third World increase their solidarity, enlist the countries of the Second World, and wage a skillful struggle, then they could also have the final word in the United Nations. In such an event the United Nations itself could be turned into a genuine organization of peace and progress serving the interests of the peoples of the Third World, and make such an arena of the superpowers like the Security Council correspondingly inoperative, and wreck the attempts of some of the big countries to turn the UN into their plaything.We think that if the struggle continues in such a direction then in the future a new organization like the UN headed by the countries of the Third World might be created independent of the existing UN.In our opinion, the possibility is not excluded of convening a conference of newborn forces of the Third World at an appropriate time in order to organize and develop such a movement.You, Comrade Josip Broz Tito, as one of the generally-recognized eminent leaders of the Third World, have truly done much in the name of the unity and independence of the peoples of the Third World. We hope that in the future you will make a great contribution to this noble cause.Further, I would like to dwell on the question of the participation of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea in the Non-Aligned Movement to make an active contribution to strengthening the solidarity of the Third World and the further development of the world revolutionary movement.We have always devoted deep attention to the Non-Aligned Movement and highly appreciate its anti-militaristic, peace-loving, and progressive role.The Non-Aligned Movement, directed against all forms of aggression, enslavement, and inequality, plays an important role in strengthening the unity and solidarity of the anti-imperialist forces, including the countries of the Third World, and is making a great contribution at the present time to the development of  the world revolutionary movement. And our country, as a country belonging to the Third World, desires to join the ranks of the Non-Aligned Countries if they do not object to this.Inasmuch as there is a good precedent, that although Yugoslavia is a socialist country, but at the same time as a country belonging to the Third World, it plays a great role in the ranks of the nonaligned countries, and we think we could join the ranks of the nonaligned countries and pursue our activity among them.True, here we have other problems unlike Yugoslavia.This is conditioned by the fact that our country has bilateral military alliances with other socialist countries. But this is essentially unlike the fact that others are members of such a multilateral military bloc as the Warsaw Pact. In addition, we have no foreign military bases in the country.Inasmuch as we are actively fighting against imperialism, colonialism, and for independence, in our opinion this is in our opinion a problem which can be overcome and does not serve as a great hindrance to our participation in the Non-Aligned Movement.We are not forgetting that in the past year you, Comrade Josip Broz Tito, have applied every sincere effort to invite us to take part as an observer at the highest level in the 4th Conference of Non-Aligned Countries in Algiers.You are one of the founders of the Non-Aligned Movement and have many years of rich experience in the development of this movement, and therefore I think that you could give us great help in this question.Here I have finished passing you the words of Comrade Kim Il Sung.We would be very grateful to you if you would express your valuable opinions on these questions.I thank you for the attention.\n",

To permit the training of 1,000 tankists, 2,000 pilots, 500 radio operators, and 500 engineering officers from among Soviet Koreans residing in the Soviet Union.I ask you, comrade STALIN, to render us assistance in this regard.Respectfully, KIM IL SUNG\"I support KIM IL SUNG'S request.

The adversary, suffering one defeat after another, was cornered into a tiny piece of land at the southern-most tip of South Korea and we had a great chance of winning a victory in the last decisive battles.Such a situation considerably damaged the military authority of the United States. Therefore, in those conditions, in order to restore its prestige and to implement by any means its long-held plans of conquering Korea and transforming it into its militarily strategic bridgehead, on 16.9.50, the U.S. performed an assault landing operation and landed a considerable number of troops and armaments in the vicinity of Incheon after having mobilized almost all its land, naval, and air troops deployed in the Pacific ocean. The enemy took over Incheon and is engaged in street combats in the city of Seoul itself. The military situation became perilous. The units of our People's Army heroically fight against advancing assault landing units of the enemy. However, we consider it necessary to report to You about the emergence of very unfavorable conditions for us.The enemy's air force numbering about a thousand airplanes of various types, facing no rebuff from our side, totally dominate the air space and perform air raids at the fronts and in the rear day and night. At the fronts, under the air cover of hundreds of airplanes the motorized units of the enemy engage us in combat at their free will and inflict great losses to our manpower and destroy our armaments. Moreover, by freely destroying railroads and highways, telegraph and telephone communications lines, means of transportation and other facilities, the enemy's air force impedes the provision of supplies to our combat units and bars maneuvers by our troops, thereby making their timely redeployments impossible. We experience this difficulty on all fronts.Having cut off all the communications lines of our troops and joined the assault force that landed in Incheon with the units of their southern front that broke through our frontline, the adversary has a real opportunity to take over the city of Seoul completely.As a result, the units of the People's Army that are still fighting in the southern part of Korea have been cut off from the northern part of Korea, they are torn into pieces and cannot receive munitions, armaments, and food rations. Moreover, some units do not have any communication with each other, while some of them are surrounded by enemy troops.After taking over Seoul completely, the enemy is likely to launch a further offensive into North Korea. Therefore, we believe that if in future the above-mentioned conditions unfavorable to us continue, then the American aggression ultimately will be successful. In order to provide troops with all the necessary supplies and to feed the frontline without any interruption, first of all, we need to have an appropriate air force. But we do not possess well-trained pilots.Dear Comrade STALIN, we are determined to overcome all the difficulties facing us so that Korea will not be a colony and a military springboard of the U.S. imperialists. We will fight for the independence, democracy and happiness of our people to the last drop of blood. Therefore, with all our energy we are taking decisive measures for the formation and training of many new divisions with the aim of using more than 100,000 troops mobilized in South Korea[captured in South Korea - AM] in the most advantageous operational areas, as well as arming the entire people so as to be prepared to fight a protracted war.This notwithstanding, if the enemy does not give us time to implement the measures which we plan, and, making use of our extremely grave situation, steps up its offensive operations into North Korea, then we will not be able to stop the enemy troops solely with our own forces.Therefore, dear Iosif Vissarionovich, we cannot help asking You to provide us with special assistance. In other words, at the moment when the enemy troops cross over the 38th parallel we will badly need direct military assistance from the Soviet Union.If for any reason this is impossible, please assist us by forming international volunteer units in China and other countries of people's democracy for rendering military assistance to our struggle.We request Your directive regarding the aforementioned proposal.

Gromykochief of the 4th Department of the 8th Directorate of the Armed Forces General Staff [illegible signature]Moscow - the KremlinDEARIosif Vissarionovich STALINIn the name of the Korean Worker’s Party we send you, the liberator of the Korean people and leader of the working people of the entire world, deep appreciation for the sympathy and aid which you constantly give our people who are fighting for the freedom and independence of our homeland.In this letter we would like to briefly inform you of the situation at the present time on the fronts of the war of liberation of our people against the American aggressors.Before the amphibious operations in the region of Incheon (Chemulpo) the situation at the fronts could not be assessed as unfavorable for us.The enemy, suffering defeat after defeat, was driven into a small territory in the very south of South Korea and we had a great chance of victory in subsequent decisive battles.Such a situation badly shook the military authority of the US.Therefore in the situation that had been created the US with the goal of restoring its authority and accomplishing its long-held plans to seize Korea at any cost and turn it into its strategic military bridgehead, mobilizing almost all the ground, naval, and air forces in the Pacific Ocean, made an amphibious operation on 16 September 1950 and landed a considerable amount of troops and equipment in the region of Incheon. The enemy seized Incheon and is waging street battles right in the city of Seoul.A threatening situation has been created. Units of our People’s Army are fighting heroically against advancing assault units of the enemy. However, we consider it necessary to report to you about the very unfavorable conditions for us.Enemy aviation numbering about 1,000 aircraft of different types, completely rule the air without encountering any resistance from our part, and have daily made round-the-clock raids at the fronts and in the rear.At the fronts motorized units of the enemy under the protection of hundreds of aircraft maneuver freely, inflicting great losses in manpower and equipment. At the same time enemy aircraft, freely destroying railroads and highways, telegraph and telephone communications, transportation equipment, and other facilities, are interrupting the supply of operational units and pinning down the operations of our troops, making it impossible for the units to make timely maneuvers. We are this difficulty is being experienced on all fronts.Having cut all the communications of our units and linked up the assault troops which landed in the region of Incheon with the units of the southern front which have broken through our front, the enemy has a real chance of completely occupying the city of Seoul.As a result of this units of the People’s Army in the southern part of Korea have been cut off from the northern part by the enemy, and also units in South Korea have been smashed into pieces and they can not now receive ammunition, weapons, and food. And what is more, some units cannot communicate with one another, and part are surrounded by enemy forces.With the complete occupation of Seoul the enemy obviously will undertake a further offensive on North Korea. Concerning this, we think that if conditions unfavorable to us continue to occur the American aggression will in the final account be successful.In order to supply the troops with everything necessary and to feed the front without interruption we need to have appropriate air forces most of all. But we have no trained personnel.Dear Cde. STALIN! We are fully determined to overcome all the difficulties with which we are faced so that Korea not be a colony or bridgehead of American imperialism. We will fight to the last drop of blood for the independence, democracy, and happiness of our people. Therefore we are taking vigorous measures with all [our] energy to form and train a multitude of new divisions to use the more than 100,000 troops mobilized in South Korea in more favorable operational regions, and to arm all the people in order to be ready for a long war.In spite of this, if the enemy does not give [us] time to take the steps we have planned and, making use of our extraordinarily difficult situation, forces offensive operations on North Korea, then we will not be able to stop the enemy with our own forces.Therefore, dear Iosif Vissarionovich, we cannot fail to ask you for special assistance. In other words, at the moment enemy troops cross the 38th parallel we [will] very much need the direct military assistance from the Soviet Union.If this is impossible for some reason then give us aid in the creation of international volunteer units in China and other countries of people’s democracy to give military assistance to our fight.We request your instructions about our proposals aboveSincerely, the CC of the Korean Worker’s PartyKIM IL SUNG, PAK HEON-YEONG29 September 1950Sent by Shcherbakova at 0145 1 October 1940 (26)\n",

For your information, guidelines are delivered to major embassies in Asia, Europe and Americas to let them know the government’s stance on the U.S. troop withdrawal from Korea and U.S.'s resultant change in policy on Korea as follows:a. In the middle of the current presidential campaign, Jimmy Carter, U.S. Democratic candidate, has once suggested that the U.S. foreign policies on Korea would be likely to change, stating that it would be necessary for the U.S. troops in Korea to phase out. b. The U.S. forces are stationed in Korea to in accordance with the U.N. Security Council resolution and the ROK-US Mutual Defense Treaty. The U.S. forces have been effective war deterrence against North Korea, and played an important role in keeping security and power balance in Northeast Asia and the Pacific regions.c. Therefore, it is indispensable for U.S. armed forces to continue stationing in Korea at this point; the U.S. withdrawal would take risk of breaking the power balance in the Korean Peninsula and security in Far East.d. Under these circumstances, we hope our friendly countries support our stance stated above and cooperate with us. In addition, every nation concerned is encouraged to deliver either directly or indirectly to the U.S. that it is not wise to make light of the U.S. troop withdrawal from Korea.e. You are required to work secretly and report frequently based on the following guidelines: i. Persuade both authorities in your host country (mainly the ministry of foreign affairs in your host country, or other possible ways, if necessary, under local circumstances.) and influential political figures into stressing the necessity of the U.S. presence in Asia and U.S. forces in Korea to local authorities, such as the U.S. government and Congress, either officially or unofficially at every opportunity.ii. Influence the media in your host country so that they claim the above point in the editorials, articles, or other ways. Try to persuade high-ranking personnel or influential public figures in your host country into stating similar opinions frequently and officially so as to appeal to the public. (North America Division 1, East Asia Division, West Asia Division, and Europe Division 1) Addressee: Korean ambassadors to Malaysia, Indonesia, Thai, Singapore, Philippines, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Netherland, Sweden, France, Germany, Belgium, and Canada.2. You are required to have the U.S. government announce that the Carter administration would keep the same policy toward Korea as the previous ones at appropriate time and way, work tactfully in order to affect public opinion into such points, and report the outcomes at any times.

      "The December session of the KWP [Korean Workers Party] Central Committee passed a resolution to reinforce the defense of the country. According to the resolution, a strong defense system must be established in the whole country, the population must be armed, and the country must be kept in a state of mobilization.From what I hear, large-scale work is going on throughout the country; not only entrenchments but also air-raid shelters for the population are being built in the mountains. As the Soviet Ambassador informed me, Kim Il Sung explained to him in a conversation that the geographical conditions of the country (mountainous terrain) give a certain advantage to them in case of an atomic war, for the mountains ward off the explosions to a substantial extent, and a lot of such bombs would be needed to wreak large-scale destruction in the country. The construction of these air-raid shelters is presumably related to this theory.The Czechoslovak ambassador informed me that the Koreans propagated a theory that cited the South Vietnamese events as an example. In that country, there is essentially a war against the Diem government and the American imperialist troops, and, as is well known, the partisan units have succeeded in winning over more and more territory from the influence of the Diem puppet government. In spite of all this, the Americans make no attempt to use atomic bombs. Does anything support the assumption that the Americans would act otherwise in case of a South Korean war, then? It is obvious that there is nothing to support such an assumption.Czechoslovak Ambassador Comrade Moravec also told me that at the dinner party held by Deputy Foreign Minister Kim Tae-hwi [Kim Thae Hwi] […], Major General Jang Jeong-hwan [Jang Jong Hwan], the Korean representative on the Panmunjeom Armistice Commission, approached him after dinner and put the following question to him: “What would you do if some day the enemy took one of the two rooms of your flat?” Comrade Moravec replied, “Whatever happens, I would resort to methods that did not run the risk of destroying the whole building or the whole city […].” Thereupon [Major] General Jang threw a cigarette-box he had in his hand on the table, and left him standing. […]I had a conversation with Soviet Ambassador Comrade Moskovsky about these issues. He told me the following: Recently he paid a visit to CC Vice-Chairman Pak Geum-cheol [Pak Kum Chol], to whom he forwarded a telegram from the competent Soviet authorities that invited several persons for a vacation in the Soviet Union. During his visit he asked Pak Geum-cheol what his opinion was of the fact […] that Park Chung Hee and the South Korean military leaders recently had a talk with Meloy, the commander of the “UN troops,” about the defense of South Korea. In the view of the CC Vice-Chairman, for the time being no adventurist military preparations were to be expected because of the following two reasons: 1) The transfer of power to civilian authorities was going on, that is, they were putting other clothes on the Fascist dictatorship, and they were busy with that. 2) The South Korean economic situation was difficult, and it was inconceivable under the circumstances that they would make serious preparations to pursue adventurist aims.The CC Vice-Chairman also expounded their viewpoint concerning South Korea. After Syngman Rhee had been driven away, when Chang Myun was in power, but even as late as the beginning of last year, their view on the South Korean situation was that a successful opposition to the Fascist dictatorship, led by the students and the intelligentsia, was possible. By now it has become obvious that there is no chance of it, and Park Chung Hee has even succeeded in improving the country’s economic situation to a certain extent. In these circumstances one cannot negotiate with the Fascist dictatorship on peaceful unification, and the process of the country’s unification drags on. […]With regard to the resolution of the CC, Comrade Moskovsky also thinks that arming the population and keeping it in a state of mobilization is a rather unusual measure in peacetime. The economic situation of both North Korea and China is quite difficult, they have a lot of problems. Under the circumstances a military action is hardly to be expected from them. Or on the contrary? “Would their economic difficulties possibly plunge them into some adventure?” Comrade Moskovsky asked. It is not easy to say yes or no to such questions. The first sentence of the resolution of the December plenum begins as follows: The development of the international situation is favorable to the Korean revolution. However, the remaining part of the resolution tries to refute that, while Pak Geum-cheol said they were not threatened by any southern adventurist provocation. If they look upon the situation in that light, […] why are these unusual defense measures needed?As is well-known, last year the Korean leaders had specially asked the Soviet government to have the issue of the withdrawal of American troops from South Korea put on the agenda of the 17th UN session, the Soviet Ambassador went on. But when the session opened, the government of the DPRK declared that the UN was not competent to deal with the Korean question. Unfortunately, the fact was that we often heard contradictory opinions here, Comrade Moskovsky said.I agree with Comrade Moskovsky that the policy of the Korean leaders is not an unvarying and consistent one. Otherwise, these contradictory statements serve the aim that they [the North Koreans] can justify [their actions] in any event. József Kovács(ambassador)\n",

      "Concerning my ciphered telegrams of April 24th and 26th, I report the following:Romanian Ambassador M. Bodnăraş and GDR Ambassador H. Brie separately informed Comrade Moskovsky about what Chinese Ambassador Hao Deqing had told them with regard to the situation in Asia. Speaking about the support to be provided to Vietnam, Hao Deqing declared that the Soviet Union was supplying obsolete anti-aircraft guns and machine guns to Vietnam. In addition, the Soviet government asked for China’s permission to establish a Soviet military base, at which at least four thousand Soviet military advisers would be stationed, in Kunming.  In the opinion of the Chinese ambassador, things were progressing well in Vietnam and Asia, too, but he pointed out that the struggle against American imperialism would not be decided by the situation in Vietnam. The American imperialists must be chased out from the whole of Indochina, and even from the whole of Asindoia; this is what they [the Chinese] are preparing for. According to the Chinese standpoint, this required an unexpected attack [launched] on a wide front, the Chinese ambassador said. One must start military operations [all over] from Indochina to Korea, by which we will dissipate the military force of the imperialists. The Chinese ambassador also declared that China and the DPRK had reached an agreement that at a suitable time, and after the creation of a suitable pretext, they would start military operations against the American occupying forces along the demarcation line in Panmunjeom.The Chinese people had done their best to develop the national economy and to construct socialism, Hao Deqing said. Unfortunately, the development of the international situation hinders their work to build up the country, and they must discontinue their efforts; they must switch to armed struggle against imperialism, and they must eliminate imperialism.Cuban Ambassador Vigoa also informed me about this Chinese plan (he was the one who raised the issue). Among others, he said that according to the information available to him, the Chinese government was making preparations for a large-scale surprise attack that would be extended from Korea to Malaysia. During Subandrio’s visit in China in January, they allegedly managed to reach an agreement that at a suitable time, Indonesia would also launch an attack on Malaysia. Comrade Vigoa’s conversation with Yi Hyo-sun indicates a similar tendency. Namely, said person stated in the presence of the [Cuban] ambassador that they (Korea) were ready to take action against the imperialist occupying forces, but for the time being, they were reluctant to [initiate] such an action, because due to the inter-party disagreements, there was no unity between the socialist countries. That is, they were not certain whether the fraternal countries would support such a military operation.There is a small discrepancy between the narratives of the Romanian and GDR ambassadors. Comrade Bodnăraş claimed that the Chinese were making preparations for such an action, and they would [launch] it at their convenience, whereas according to Comrade Brie (who later corrected this statement, though), the Chinese ambassador expressed the view that an all-out military operation would take place [only] if American aggression directly affected China, too. It is possible that the information provided by the Chinese ambassador serves purposes of disinformation, for it is doubtful if the Chinese ambassador would so “confidentially” disclose such a state secret. Nevertheless, one cannot know for sure if they are actually contemplating such a plan or not. According to the information that I obtained from Comrade Polish Ambassador Naperaj in the recent days, the Korean comrades are in the process of concentrating troops near the demarcation line. Lately, they have not granted permission to the [members of the] Polish section of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to hunt in the vicinity of the demarcation line in Panmunjeom.  On the occasion of my trip to Panmunjeom on May 12-14th, I also noticed the construction of new anti-tank obstacles in the northern part of the demilitarized zone. True, in the opinion of Comrade Colonel Borski, the stones, whose diameter is approximately 50-60 centimeters and which have been placed on the soft soil that was tilled as late as last year, can hardly be regarded as effective anti-tank obstacles. Nevertheless, this is the first occasion since 1953 that such [obstacles] are being constructed along the highway.Finally, one may raise the question (which we discussed with the Polish ambassador) of whether the Chinese obstruction of Soviet arms shipments to Vietnam could be related to the aforesaid Chinese plan.József Kovács(ambassador)    \n",

      "[....]Nº 54611      18 May 1949 1718Yesterday, 17 May, Mao Zedong asked me to inform you of the following:1. Kim Il, the Chief of the Political Directorate of the Korean Army, arrived from North Korea (he participated in the partisan movement in Manchuria together with Kim Il Sung). Cde. Kim Il has the authority to discuss the following issues with the CPC CC:1. The situation in the Orient.2. The creation of an information bureau.3. Aid to North Korea with officer personnel and weapons.Cde. Mao Zedong said that he thinks that the issue of creating an Eastern Information Bureau [informbyuro] is still premature [ne sozrel]. Of the 12 countries in the Orient the Chinese Communist Party has ties for now with only five: the MNR, Thailand, Indochina, the Philippines, and Korea, and with the others, even with Japan and Indonesia, permanent ties have not been organized. We know little of the situation in these countries. Therefore, he said, it is better to first establish these ties, study the situation, and only then begin creating an Eastern Communist [SIC, Kominformbyuro] Information Bureau. [North Korea] ought to limit itself right now to the establishment of mutual [SIC, vzaimnye] telegraph agencies with the aid of which ideas on specific issues are exchanged as they arise.2. As regards helping North Korea with officer personnel and weapons, Cde. Mao Zedong said that such aid would be granted. There are one and a half million Koreans in Manchuria, from which two Korean divisions have been formed (of 10,000 men each). One of them has combat experience. It took an active part in battles with the Guomindang troops in Manchuria. We can transfer these divisions to North Korea at any time at their request. But as long as the Korean comrades have no need of them we will supply these divisions with everything and train them. In addition, we have also trained 200 officers who are undergoing additional training right now and in a month they can be sent to Korea.If a war breaks out between North and South Korea we are also ready to give everything that is in our power, especially for these divisions (food and weapons).The Korean comrades think that the American troops might be evacuated from South Korea in the near future but they are afraid that Japanese troops will come there to replace the American troops with whose aid the Southerners might mount an attack on North Korea.We advised them to counterattack these troops but when doing so take into consideration the presence or absence of Japanese troops in the South Korean army without fail. If Japanese units take part then exhibit caution and in the event that the enemy has the superior forces, then it is better give up part of their own territory to be in more advantageous conditions to surround the invading troops and rout them.We advised them to prepare the Party, the troops, and the people ideologically that such a situation is possible and that this would not mean the defeat of democratic Korea but only a strategic maneuver.If the Americans leave and the Japanese do not come, we do not advise the Korean comrades to mount an attack on South Korea in this situation but to wait for a more suitable situation because MacArthur might quickly move Japanese units and weapons to Korea during this attack. We cannot give quick substantial support since all our main forces have withdrawn beyond the Yangtze River.We think that such a step, an attack by North Korea on the South, might be mounted at the beginning of 1950 if the situation at the beginning of 1950 favors this. Then, in the event of an invasion of Korea by Japanese troops, we will be able to quickly move our crack troops and defeat the Japanese forces.Of course, added Cde. Mao Zedong, we would take all our steps in this direction only after coordinating them with Moscow.3. With regard to the establishment of trade relations with North Korea  and also the resolution of the issue of the use of the hydroelectric power station on the Yalu River we suggested that Cde. Kim Il to go to Shenyang and come to an agreement [dogovorit'sya, which can also mean \"negotiate] on these issues with Cde. Gao Gang.Cde. Mao Zedong passed the information in the presence of Cdes. Zhu De, Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Dong Biwu, Chen Yun, and Bo Yibo.No. 477 - Kovalev, 18 May[...]\n",

The period of retraining was established as one and a half to two months, so that these divisions could take part in the forthcoming operations in Korea.To the question I raised about the construction of three additional airbases for the deployment of Chinese divisions, Comrade Mao Zedong answered that Nie Rongzhen in the name of the Prime Minister sent a telegram to Comrade Kim Il Sung with a request to select a place to the south of Pyongyang and as soon as possible build three airbases there for jet planes.The commander of the VVS [Air Force] of the PLA [People's Liberation Army] of China Liu Yalou, who was present at the conversation, stated that they have in mind using the MIG-9s in the future in schools and in the PVO [Anti- Aircraft Defense] system of the country.An order was given by me to the commands of the 17th, 144th and 328th fighter aviation divisions immediately to begin retraining the 6th, 12th and 14th Chinese fighter aviation divisions on MIG-15 planes, according to the confirmed program.KRASOVSKYNo. 323528.6.51\n",

Zhou Enlai was also present.After listening to the recommendation of the Soviet government and the CPSU Central Committee about the desirability of curtailing the campaign for unmasking the Americans' use of bacteriological weapons in Korea and China, Mao Zedong said that the campaign was begun on the basis of reports from the command of Chinese volunteers in Korea and in Manchuria. It is difficult to establish now the authenticity of these reports. However, we have studied this question and will return to it once more. If falsification is discovered, then these reports from below should not be believed. In his turn, Mao said that in the struggle against counterrevolution, 650,000 persons were executed in the country, [and] it is true that one should not think that all those killed were guilty. Some number of innocent people apparently suffered.In the course of the conversation some nervousness was noticed on the part of Mao Zedong, he smoked a lot, crushed cigarettes and drank a lot of tea.

The Albanian people and our party are sincerely happy for the great victories and successes of the brotherly Korean people, who under the leadership of the Korean Workers’ Party, with Comrade Kim Il Sung at its helm, has turned the Democratic Peoples’ Republic of Korea into a socialist country with a developed and independent industry and agriculture, where the life quality and material well-being of the Korean people are always on the rise.  We support without any reservations its resolute struggle in the defense of independence and the socialist system, for the reunification of the entire Korea, against the plots of the American imperialists, against its puppets in South Korea, against the Japanese militarism, as well as all the other imperialist and revisionist enemies, who openly or secretly cooperate to the detriment of the vital interests of the brotherly Korean people, of the great Peoples’ China, of all the peace loving people of South East Asia, who with weapons in their hands are heroically fighting the American imperialist aggression. Wishing to your 5th Congress success in its proceedings, we take this opportunity to express our conviction that the militant friendship and the internationalist solidarity that exists between our two peoples and two parties will continue to consolidate further on the basis of the lessons of Marxism-Leninism, in the common struggle against the imperialism, with the American imperialists at its helm, against the modern revisionism, with the soviet revisionists at its helm, as the only just course for the preservation of the victories of socialism and for the triumph of communism.

      "01/0152523/06.12.1973To Direction I Relations – Comrade Ion CiubotaruWe further inform you about the various reactions within the DPRK concerning the U.N. consensus over the Korean issue, a topic intensely debated within the diplomatic corps in Pyongyang.As we formerly pointed out, the consensus of Committee no.1 over the Korean issue, which was received with enthusiasm in Pyongyang, as a great victory, in fact represents a practical compromise solution (as opposed to the unjustified requests during the period of preparations for the General Assembly), which the DPRK is accepting as an alternative to the South Korean project of enrolling two Koreas at the U.N. From the comments of socialist diplomats as well as of other countries, partially confirmed by the insistence with which the Korean press is justifying the position of the DPRK government, it has become apparent that some members of the Korean leadership, militaries most of all, have not fully grasped the concession made in favor of U.S. troops stationing in South Korea, an issue which remained outside the final document adopted on 21 November.On the other hand, the realist spirit in which the U.N. has solved this issue is ignored in North-South relations. Polemics on various topics is intensifying. On the backdrop of political tensions on both sides, throughout the last days military elements have sprung, motivated by the repeated entry of DPRK ships in the territorial waters of islands recently claimed by the North (next to Haeju port in the Yellow Sea). This course of action, explained by DPRK as a means of exercising legitimate control in these territories, is seen by authorities in Seoul as the most serious incident since the ‘Pueblo Case’ in 1968 which triggered a state of military alert from the part of South Korea, coupled with the threat that a future similar attempt would result in retaliation. In case DPRK aimed these actions at supporting student movements in South Korea, the result was the opposite, as the general mobilization of the army is on the verge of resulting in the forceful repression of youth movements.   We note that conversely, the authorities in Seoul used this action to pass through parliament—without objections—the military budget for 1974.Signed: Aurelian Lazar\n",

      "02/0422/1973년 1월 16일수신: 제2관계국지난 열흘 간 남북 관계와 관련하여 발생한 주요 사안들 중, 1972년 말에 조성된 비교적 평온한 분위기의 악화를 초래한 몇 가지 사안에 대하여 설명하고자 한다.(1972년 12월에 선포된) 국가비상사태 이후 실행된 일련의 조치들이 성공을 거두면서, 남한에서는 정치적 안정화가 진행되었고 이러한 안정화 절차는 계속해서 공고해졌다.남한 당국이 국제적으로 접촉을 진행하면서 (김종필과 닉슨 및 다나카 간의 담화) 남한 정부는 안전하다는 인식을 갖게 되었다.이러한 상황에서 남한 당국은 국방 체계를 강화하고 대규모 군사작전 및 지역방위훈련을 완료하기 위한 작업을 추진했으며, 북측으로부터의 \"위험성\"을 비방하고 유포하는 과거의 방식을 다시금 채택했다.1월 12일에 있었던 신년 첫 기자회견에서 박정희 대통령은 조선민주주의인민공화국에 대해 거친 말투를 사용하며, 북조선에 대한 불신이 여전히 만연해 있으므로 군사력을 강화할 필요가 있다고 주장했다. 이와 동시에 박정희는 남북관계의 효율성이 떨어졌다는 사실을 강조했다.이에 대해 조선민주주의인민공화국은 남한에 대한 비난 공세를 재개하였는데, 특히 군사 행동 및 남한의 군사 현대화 작업에 대한 미국의 개입을 비난했다.박성철 부총리가 공개 회담에서 실시한 담화 (1973년 1월 10일자)에서는 \"남조선 당국은 끊임없이 파시스트적이고 주전론적인 정책을 강화하고 있다\"는 오래된 단언이 다시금 등장했다.조선민주주의인민공화국은 남한 내외에서 조성되고 있는 박정희에 대한 개인 숭배의 분위기, 그리고 박정희가 5천만 조선인들을 대변하고 있다는 사실, 즉 박정희가 북조선과의 접촉에 있어 전적인 주도권을 주장하고 있다는 사실에 격분하고 있다.남북 간 대화가 교착상태에 빠지게 된 원인을 분석함에 있어, 우리는 그 원인이 북남 간 접촉의 목적, 단계 및 흐름에 관한 견해에 있다고 생각하고 있다.남측은 단순한 문제에서 시작해서 보다 복잡한 문제를 다뤄 나가는 점진적인 접근법을 선호하는 반면, 북측은 근본적인 사안을 직접적이고 신속하게 다룸으로써 사소한 사안들을 해결해 나가는 방식을 추진하고 있다.두 번째로, 남측은 당분간 조선민주주의인민공화국이 구상하고 있는 협력 조치들을 수락하지 않을 것이다. 이 조치들은 북한의 정치적, 경제적 우월성을 기반으로 하여 수립되었으며, 남측 국민들의 정치적으로 혁명적인 목적에 부합하기 때문이다.현재의 상황, 특히 양측에 의해 발표된 고위급 공식 선언들로 미루어 보아, 남북조절위원회 설립을 통해 이론적으로 수립된 이해 및 조화를 이행하기 위한 효과적인 조치가 취해지지는 않을 것으로 전망된다.서명: 아우렐리안 라자르[Aurelian Lazăr ]\n",

      "To the First Direction, RelationsOn 27 June An Jang-il [An Jang Il], division head within the International Section of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers’ Party briefed the Romanian chargé d'affaires on the third session of the South-North Coordinating Committee, which took place on 12-14 June in Seoul.After presenting the well-known position of the DPRK, which aims at achieving a relaxation of tensions on the Korean Peninsula through disarmament, reducing military forces, creating the five commissions of the Coordinating Committee, and covering political, military, economic, diplomatic and socio-cultural matters, An Jang-il stressed on the causes for which the South Koreans are not accepting the proposals of the North. In this respect, he said, at the secret meetings between the two co-presidents, Lee Hu-rak, the South Korean representative, said that South Korea would have been more receptive to the proposals of the North if the United States and Japan would not have exerted pressure on certain groups, especially on military groups in the South Korean governmental apparatus.There are several strands of thought developing in governmental circles in Seoul, and here Lee Hu-rak referred to the military trend as the most powerful one and the most hostile to unification, then to a centrist trend which is leaning towards contacts with the North (limited to economic and socio-cultural matters) and the opposition, comprising progressive and patriotic forces, which are keen on a rapid achievement of unification. An Jang-il described the situation in South Korea as unstable, which is why Seoul is trying to slow down the process of unification, formulating proposals to revise the agreements reached in July 1972 and the agreements which led to the creation of the South-North Coordinating Committee.The [North Korean] interlocutor mentioned that the third session in Seoul ended without achieving any concrete results, that there are new and great difficulties ahead in the field of North-South contacts, and that the duration of the process of unification is much longer than initially envisaged.Furthermore, An Jang-il said that currently South Korea launched an operation meant to enshrine the division of Korea by pushing towards the simultaneous accession of the two Koreas to the United Nations. “We fear,” he said, “that this South Korean plan will gain support from Third World countries, from those who do not know or who have a simplistic view of the solution for the Korean problem.”An Jang-il said that the propaganda agencies in the DPRK would launch an operation to unmask the intentions of the South Koreans and to explain Pyongyang’s position in light of comrade Kim Il Sung’s statement dated 23 June.

      "수신: 제1관계국6월 27일, 조선로동당 중앙위원회 외무부 부장 안장일은 루마니아 공사와 만나 6월 12-14일 서울에서 열린 남북조절위원회 제3차 회담에 대하여 보고했다.군비 축소, 군사력 감축, 정치, 군사, 경제, 외교 및 사회문화 주제를 다룰 조절위원회 5개 세부위원회 개설로 한반도 긴장완화를 추구하고자 하는 조선민주주의인민공화국의 잘 알려진 입장을 밝힌 다음, 안장일은 남한이 북측의 제안을 받아들이지 않는 원인에 대하여 강조했다. 그의 말에 따르면 남한 대표 이후락과의 비밀 회담에서 남한 대표[이후락]는, 만약 미국과 일본이 남한 정부의 군사단체 등, 특정 단체에 압력을 가하지 않는다면 남측은 북측의 제안에 보다 호의적일 것이라고 언급했다고 한다.서울 정부 내에 몇 개의 의견을 가진 단체들이 생겨나고 있는데, 이후락은 북측과의 (경제, 사회문화적 주제에 극한된)접촉에 호의적인 중도파와 진보 및 애국적 세력으로 즉각적인 통일을 추구하는 반대파와 비교할 때, 군사단체가 가장 강력하며 통일에 가장 적대적인 것으로 지목했다.안장일은 남한의 상황이 불안정하며 그렇기 때문에 서울이 통일 [추진] 절차를 늦추고 1972년 7월 합의되어 남북조절위원회의 개설에 이르게 한 협약을 수정하고자 제안한 것이라고 설명했다. [북조선] 소식통은 서울에서의 제3차 회담은 뚜렷한 결과 없이 종결되었으며 북-남 접촉에는 새로운 난관이 많이 기다리고 있다고 말했으며, 통일에 이르는 절차는 초기 예상보다 훨씬 오래 걸릴 것으로 예상된다고 이야기했다. 또한 안장일은 현재 남한이 유엔에 두 개의 조선을 동시 가입시켜 조선의 영원한 분단을 야기하려는 계획을 시작했다고 말했다. 그는 “우리는 남측의 계획이 조선 문제를 잘 모르거나 그것이 단순히 해결될 것이라는 관점을 가지고 있는 제3세계 국가로부터 호응을 얻게 될까 우려한다”고 말했다.안장일은 조선민주주의인민공화국의 선전부가, 남조선인들의 의도를 드러내고 6월 23일 발표된 김일성 동지의 성명에 따라 평양의 입장을 밝히는 작전을 개시할 것이라고 말했다. 서명: Aurelian Lazăr\n",

      "To: Direction II Relations02/01476/3.IIIConcerning the inter-Korean relations in the context of changes and contacts in the area, we inform:Recently we are noticing from both sides the more precise formulation of views on the timing, the shape and purpose of mutual relations. Via significant political comments recently published in the press, the DPRK has resumed the idea of political cooperation with the South, of economic collaboration, of establishing the Korean Confederation.These proposals point to complex forms of collaboration, with political effects, as opposed to the limited South Korean view. We consider that the renewal of these theses is the answer to the declarations of the South Korean Foreign Minister, who noted that, according to South Korea, relations have to start with addressing humanitarian aspects (making the object actually of contacts between Red Cross organizations) and follow into commercial exchange, and culminate at an advanced stage with free reciprocal visits as well as other forms of cooperation, including political ones.Judging from the affirmations of certain functionaries in the Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs, soon the phase of stagnation in North-South dialogue (December-February, when both parts were focusing on consolidating internal organizational and juridical measures, as well as on mutual observation) shall be overcome.The 27 February Parliamentary elections in South Korea—the last stage of internal political stabilization—faces DPRK with one dialogue partner, namely Park Chung Hee. This is a significantly more difficult moment by comparison with 1972, when the political dispersal and disorganization in the South made it easier for the DPRK to apply its own unification view.At the same time, diplomats from both parts have become more active in securing international support for their own position in the peninsula.From the many actions launched abroad by the DPRK and South Korea in mid-February, we view as particularly significant the beginning of the Sino-American dialogue concerning U.S. troop withdrawals from Korea.We consider that the main objective of the visit to Peking of the Minister for Foreign Affairs Heo Dam [Ho Tam] was supporting the Chinese initiative in conversations with H. Kissinger for withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea. The presence in Washington of South Korean Minister of Foreign Relations, Kim Yong-sik, was aimed at obtaining guarantees that the gradual withdrawal of American troops will happen only if the U. S. modernizes the South Korean army, according to the five-year-plan of economic and military assistance.At the same time, visits of the DPRK’s party, government and parliamentary delegations are taking place in over 30 countries around the world. They have a mandate to express opinions concerning the reunification, to obtain support for it and to push for the isolation of South Korea to such an extent that “the latter will have to accept the proposals and line imposed by the North.”The DPRK is facing difficulties in this activity: simultaneous measures from Seoul; the visit of Kim Yong-sik to Japan, to the Federal Republic of Germany, to the UK, to the U.N., as well as other international contacts, including socialist countries.Following the analysis of power balance in the peninsula and in order to maintain dialogue and ensure progress, we recommend a gradual approach to all issues, starting from common points of view which would allow for tackling more complex fields, including the political one.Signed: Aurelian Lazar\n",

      "수신: 제2관계국02/01476/3.III북남 간 교류 및 접촉의 맥락에서, 남북관계와 관련하여 다음과 같은 사항을 알리고자 한다.최근 들어 양측이 남북관계의 시기, 형태 및 목적에 관한 입장을 보다 구체화하고 있는 것으로 파악된다.최근 언론에 발표된 중대한 정치적 발언을 통해, 조선민주주의인민공화국은 남조선과 정치적, 경제적으로 협력을 추진하고 북남국가연합을 수립하는 방안을 재개하고 나섰다.이와 같은 북측의 제안은 정치에 영향을 미치는 복잡한 형태의 협력을 하자는 것인데, 이는 남측의 한정된 견해와는 대조적이다.북측은 남측의 외교부장관 선언에 대한 응답으로 위와 같은 방안을 다시 들고 나온 것으로 사료된다. 남측 외교부장관은, 남측 입장에 따르자면 남북관계는 인도주의적 사안의 해결로 시작되어야 하며 (실직적인 목표는 적십자사 간의 접촉) 이어서 통상 교류를 진행하고 종국에는 자유로운 상호간의 방문 및 정치적 협력을 포함한 여타의 유형의 협력을 추진해야 한다는 점을 지적한 바 있다.남측 외교부 직원들의 전언으로 미루어 보아, 북남 간 대화의 침체기 (양측이 내부 조직ㆍ법률적 조치의 강화 및 상대방에 대한 관찰에 집중하던 12월~2월의 시기)는 곧 극복될 것으로 보인다.2월 27일에 남조선에서 실시된 총선거 (내부 정치 안정화의 마지막 단계)의 결과, 조선민주주의인민공화국은 박정희라는 단 한 명의 대화 상대와 마주하게 되었다. 이는 남조선 내부의 정치적 분열 및 혼란으로 인해 통일에 대한 조선민주주의인민공화국의 견해를 적용하기가 보다 수월했던 1972년 당시보다 훨씬 어려운 상황이다.이와 동시에, 양측 외교관들은 한반도 내에서 자신들의 입장에 대한 국제 사회의 지지를 확보하기 위하여 더욱 적극적으로 노력하고 있다.2월 중순 조선민주주의인민공화국 및 남조선이 해외에서 추진한 여러 활동으로 미루어보아, 우리는 주한미군의 철수에 관한 중·미 대화의 개시를 특히 매우 중요하게 여기고 있다.우리의 견해로는, 허담 외무상이 북경을 방문한 주된 목적은 헨리 키신저와의 회담에서 언급된 주한미군 철수를 위한 중국의 계획을 지지하기 위한 것이었다고 사료된다. 남조선 김용식 외교부장관이 워싱턴에 체류했던 목적은 경제·군사 원조 5개년 계획에 따라 미국이 남조선 군대를 현대화하는 작업을 이행하여야만 주한미군의 철수가 점진적으로 이루어질 것이라는 보장을 확보하기 위해서였다.이와 동시에, 현재 조선민주주의인민공화국 당·정부 및 의회 파견단이 전세계 30여 개국을 방문하고 있다. 그들은 통일에 관한 견해를 표출하고, 이를 위한 지지를 확보하고 \"북측이 제시한 제안과 선을 후자(남측)가 수락할 수 밖에 없도록\" 하는 정도로 남조선을 고립시키는 작업을 추진하라는 임무를 부여 받았다.이와 같은 활동을 추진함에 있어, 조선민주주의인민공화국은 서울이 동시적으로 취하고 있는 조치, 김용식 외교부장관에 의한 일본, 독일연방공화국, 영국 및 유엔 방문, 그리고 사회주의 국가들과의 접촉을 포함한 기타 국제적 접촉으로 인하여 어려움을 겪고 있다.한반도 내 세력의 균형을 분석한 결과에 따라, 그리고 대화를 유지하고 성과를 보장하기 위하여, 모든 사안에 있어 공통적인 견해에서 시작하여 정치 분야를 포함한 보다 복잡한 분야를 다루는 점진적인 접근법을 취할 것을 제안하는 바이다.서명인: 아우렐리안 라자르[Aurelian Lazăr]\n",

      "To: Direction II Relations02/01650/13.IIIToday there was a simultaneous communiqué in Pyongyang and Seoul that between 14–16 March, the third meeting of the SNCC [South-North Coordinating Committee] will take place, preceded on 10 March by a meeting of the common secretariat in Panmunjeom.We are mentioning that this is the first official meeting of the two sides during the last three months after the reunion in Seoul of the SNCC, when the representative of North Korean Co-president, Deputy Prime Minister Pak Seong-cheol [Pak Song Chol], carried discussions with South Korean President Park Chung Hee.We note that the third meeting of the SNCC is taking place in a climate of tension in North-South relations, which is unprecedented since the adoption of the Joint Communiqué in June 1972.Additional to the points of tension mentioned above, there is also the incident on 7 March, in the demilitarized area, where casualties were registered on the Southern side, the first such incident since the declaration was signed.This conflict was preceded as we previously informed, by an unsuccessful attempt at landing a group of North Koreans in the South, a moment which accelerated Seoul’s decision to accept a new meeting with Pyongyang.The meeting on 14 March is preceded these days in Pyongyang by a sustained propaganda campaign against the South, a campaign which, by size and means of expression, reminds of the tense relations between the two sides prior to 1972. We mention that the South Korean propaganda means accessible to the embassy, are not engaged in such a campaign or aimed at antagonizing the North.Publicity from the side of the DPRK regarding certain political theses underlying the meaning and direction of North-South dialogue, has intensified. Among these we mention the firm rejection of ideas such as “confrontation” or “economic competition,” supported by the South, together with the insistent mention of dialogue and multilateral cooperation.Given the difficult conditions in which the planned session will be taking place, we expect it will ultimately amount to a re-affirmation of principles found in the Joint Communiqué, the toning down of the tense atmosphere, the renewal of bilateral agreements concerning mutual reparations, and expressing points of view about the final purpose and stages of the dialogue between north and south.Contacts at the level of Coordinating Committee will create the environment for reopening discussions between Red Cross Committees, expected for 21 March in Pyongyang.

      "수신: 제2관계국02/01650/13.III오늘 평양과 서울에서 공동선언문이 발표되었다. 공동선언문의 내용은 남북조절위원회 제3차 회담이 3월 14일에서 16일까지의 기간 동안 진행될 예정이며, 그에 앞서 3월 10일에는 판문점에서 공동사무국 회담이 개최될 예정이라는 것이다. 이 회담은 북측 박성철 부상과 남측 박정희 대통령 간에 회담이 진행되었던 남북조절위원회 서울 회동 이후 3개월 만에 처음 열리는 양측 간 공식 회담이라는 점을 지적하고자 한다.남북조절위원회 제3차 회담은 북남 관계에 긴장이 조성되고 있는 상황에서 진행되는 것이라는 점을 언급하고자 한다. 이러한 긴장 국면은 1972년 6월에 남북 공동선언문이 채택 된 이후 처음 있는 일이다.위에 언급한 긴장 국면에 더하여, 3월 7일 비무장지대에서 발생한 사건으로 인하여 남측에 부상자가 발생했다. 이는 공동선언문이 체결된 이후 처음으로 발생한 도발 사건이다.위와 같은 충돌에 앞서, 이미 전달한 바와 같이 북측 단체가 남측으로 잠입을 시도하였다가 실패한 바 있다. 이 사건으로 인하여 남측은 평양과의 회담을 서둘러 수락하게 되었다.3월 14일 회담 개최에 앞서, 현재 평양에서는 남측에 대한 선전 공세가 지속되고 있다. 이러한 선전의 규모와 표현 수단은 1972년 이전의 북남 간 긴장 국면을 연상시킨다.저희 대사관에서 입수 가능한 남측의 선전은 위와 같은 공세를 펼치거나 북측에 대한 적개심을 일으킬 목적을 갖고 있지 않다는 점을 언급하고자 한다.북남 간 대화의 의미 및 방향의 토대가 되는 특정 정치적 주제에 관해 조선민주주의인민공화국의 선전 활동이 강화되었다. 그 중에서도 특히, 남측에서 지지하고 있는 \"대립\" 혹은 \"경제적 경쟁\"과 같은 개념을 북측에서는 강력하게 거부하고 있으며, 대화와 다자간 협력을 거듭 언급하고 있다는 점을 지적하고자 한다.현재의 어려운 상황을 감안하면, 회담에서는 결국 공동선언문에 언급된 원칙을 재확인하고 긴장 국면을 완화하며, 상호 배상에 대한 양자간 협의 사항을 새로 정하고 북남 간 대화의 최종 목적 및 단계에 관한 견해를 표명하게 될 것으로 예상된다.남북조절위원회급 접촉은 3월 21일 평양에서 개최될 예정인 적십자 위원회 간의 논의를 재개할 수 있는 환경을 조성해줄 것이다.서명: 아우렐리안 라자르\n",

      "To: Direction II Relations02/01810/19.IIIConcerning the second meeting of the SNCC [South-North Coordinating Committee] taking place in Pyongyang throughout two sessions between 14-16 March, we inform you:Taking place on the background of strong tensions generated by two military incidents resulting in deaths, this meeting ended without clear results in any of the addressed issues, due to fundamental differences between the two sides’ positions.During the press conference held in Panmunjeom before entering the DPRK area, South Korean Co-president Lee Hu-rak said he is taking to Pyongyang a message of goodwill from President Park Chung Hee together with a positive answer to some of the previous proposals from the North.During discussions (delayed by one day at the request of the North), the representatives of Pyongyang, abandoning the questions still open since the past session, have proposed new ideas which surprised the South Korean delegation and which, due to their complexity, could not be translated into practical measures at this particular moment in time, nor were they retained by the South in view of a future study.Thus, the North, underlining the need for eliminating military confrontation between the two sides, presented a 5-point-plan consisting of: mutual disarmament, reducing troops to 100,000 people or less together with limiting arming, stopping the introduction of foreign weapons, withdrawal of foreign troops from the peninsula, including U.S. ones, banning of weapon usage and the closing of a peace agreement between the two sides.The North Korean co-president proposed that the 5 members of each side of the SNCC be doubled with the chiefs of staff from both armies, or that a subcommittee made up of representatives for chiefs of staff be charged with putting into practice the program’s five points.Pointing that this new position goes beyond its mandate and its realization is unfeasible for the moment, the South Korean delegation suggested (starting with the present session) the creation of two subcommittees: economic and social-cultural. Representatives of Pyongyang refused to take in consideration the creation of only two subcommittees, insisting on the simultaneous creation of all five (political, military, diplomatic, economic and cultural) planned in the second session of co-presidents in November 1972. This proposal was not accepted by Lee Hu-rak.Thus, due to the cautious attitude of the South and the “all or nothing” strategy of the north, the session ended without any notable success.At the press conference held on 16 March by Pyongyang-assigned co-president (to which press attaches of diplomatic missions were present), Deputy Prime Minister Pak Seong-cheol [Pak Song Chol] criticized South Korean authorities for fragmenting the issue of reunification in “simple” and “complex” issues, as well as for introducing “priorities” and “procedural sequences.” Pak Seong-cheol underlined that the “sincere wish towards reunification is sufficient for solving all problems, be they simple or complex, without any pre-established order and without preconceived procedures.”After analyzing the proceedings of the recent session, the rigid position of the DPRK who rejected Southern proposals (which, though did not exhaust all available possibilities, offered nevertheless the framework for economic, cultural, sports, etc. types of exchanges and contacts), we consider that the visible change of stance from the past of the DPRK has a lot to do with the country’s first victories resulting from synchronizing the inter-Korean dialogue with international developments (the opening of Sino-American dialogue regarding withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea).It is obvious that the DPRK is attempting, with the help of P.R. China or by itself, to gain the time necessary for obtaining the disengagement of the U.S. from the peninsula, which in turn would ensure a position of superiority for Pyongyang in inter-Korean negotiations.At the same time, the DPRK is expecting practical results from the comprehensive international campaign to make contacts (visits to approximately 45 different countries) aimed also at undermining South Korea externally.Encouraging existing trends of opinion at the international level concerning withdrawal of foreign troops from other territories, as well as increased demands of U.S. political personalities for withdrawal from South Korea and cessation of military help for Seoul, are of great interest to the DPRK.We therefore consider that the new DPRK tactic aims at achieving immediate objectives of unification without South Korea, even against it.The continuation of inter-Korean dialogue will therefore retain a formal character, depending mostly on indirect actions and various contingencies.Signed: Aurelian Lazar\n",

      "수신: 제2관계국 02/01810/19.III지난 3월 14-16일, 평양에서 두 차례 회의로 나뉘어 열린 남북조절위원회 제2차 회담과 관련해 다음과 같이 보고합니다:사상자를 낳은 두 건의 군사충돌로 인해 야기된 긴장 고조의 분위기에서 이루어진 이번 회담은, 논의된 문제에 대하여 뚜렷한 결과 없이 종결되었다. 이는 양 측 입장의 기본적인 차이 때문이었다.조선민주주의인민공화국 지역 진입에 앞서 판문점에서 이루어진 기자회견에서 남조선 위원장 이후락은 박정희 대통령으로부터 북측이 앞서 제시한 일부 제안에 대한 긍정적 답변과 선의의 메시지를 받아 평양에 가지고 간다고 말했다.(북측의 제안으로 하루 늦춰진) 회담에서 평양 대표단은 지난 회담에서 제기된 문제를 미결된 채로 포기하고 새로운 제안을 제시하여 남조선 대표단을 놀라게 하였다. 그러나 이 제안은 그 복잡성 때문에 현 시점에서 실질적 방안을 마련할 수 없었으며 남측이 추후 연구과제로 받아들이지도 않았다.따라서 북측은 양 측의 군사적 갈등해소의 필요성을 강조하며 상호 군비축소, 무기감축과 함께 군사력을 100,000명 이하로 감축, 외국 무기 도입중지, 반도에서의 미군을 포함한 외국군 철수, 무기사용 금지와 양 측 사이의 평화조약 체결을 포함한 5도 계획을 제시하였다. 북측 공동위원장은 남북조절위원회 양 측의 위원을 [기존의] 5명 외에 양 군의 참모장을 포함하여 두 배로 늘리거나 또는 프로그램의 5개 목적을 실행하도록 참모장 대표로 이루어진 소위원회를 조직할 것을 제안하였다.이러한 입장이 [기구] 목적에 벗어나며 그 실현이 현재에는 불가함을 지적하며 남조선 대표단은 (현 회담에서부터) 경제와 사회문화의 두 개 소위원회 창설을 제안하였다. 평양 대표단은 두 개 소위원회의 단독 설립을 반대하며, 1972년 11월 양 측 위원장의 2차 회담에서 계획된 대로 다섯 개(정치, 군사, 외교, 경제, 문화) 소위원회의 동시적인 창설을 주장하였다. 이후락은 이 제안을 받아들이지 않았다.남측의 조심스러운 태도와 북측의 “전부 아니면 전무” 식의 전략으로 인해 본 회담은 눈에 띄는 성공 없이 종결되었다.3월 16일 평양측 공동위원장이 개최한(외국 공관 공보관이 참석한) 기자회견에서 부상 박성철은 통일 문제를 “간단”한 것과 “복잡”한 문제들로 차별하고 “우선순위”와 “절차적 단계”를 도입한 남측 관료들을 비판하였다. 박성철은 “통일을 위한 참된 염원은 사전에 설립된 순서나 사전 합의된 절차 없이도 모든 간단하거나 복잡한 문제를 풀기에 충분하다”고 강조하였다.남측의 제안을 거절한 (모든 가능성을 잠식하지 않으며 경제, 문화, 스포츠 등의 교류와 접촉의 기반을 제안한) 이번 회담에서의 조선민주주의인민공화국의 강경한 입장을 분석한 결과, 우리는 조선민주주의인민공화국의 눈에 띄는 입장 변화가, 북남대화와 국제[관계] 개발(남한에서의 미군 철수에 대한 중-미간 대화 개시)을 연결해 낸, 그들의 첫 승리와 깊은 관계가 있다고 생각한다. 조선민주주의인민공화국이 중공을 지원을 받아 또는 그들 자력으로 반도에서 미국을 밀어내는 데 필요한 시간을 벌고자 하는 것은 틀림없다. 이에 따라 평양은 남북협상에서 유리한 입장을 차지하게 될 것이다. 동시에 조선민주주의인민공화국은 남조선의 대외관계를 약화시키고자 대대적인 국제 홍보활동을 추진(약 45개국을 방문)한 바 이에 대한 실리적인 결과를 기대하고 있다. 기타 영토에서의 외국군 철수, 남조선에서의 철수 및 서울에 대한 군사지원 중단에 대한 미국 정치권의 요구 증가에 대해 기존의 국제여론 고무는 조선민주주의인민공화국의 매우 큰 관심사이다.따라서 우리는 조선민주주의인민공화국의 새로운 전략이 남조선을 배제하거나 심지어 남조선과 대립하면서도 즉각적으로 통일 목표를 이루고자 하는 것으로 평가한다. 그러므로 북남 간의 대화는 형식적인 성격을 띄며 대체적으로 간접적인 행동이나 다양한 경우의 수에 의지할 것이다.서명: Aurelian Lazăr\n",

      "01/014916/29.4.1973To Direction I Relations, to Comrade Director Ion Ciubotaru To Direction II Relations Comrade Director L. Petrescu1. In a conversation with A. Lazar concerning recent declarations made at the U.N. by South Korean Foreign Minister Kim Yong-sik , concerning the intentions of South Korea to intensify efforts towards normalization of relations with the U.S.S.R. and P.R. China, counselor V. Denisov stated that no official relations are foreseeable for the near future between his country and Seoul. He pointed out that the U.S.S.R. representative to the U.N, Dobrynin, had a meeting with the South Korean foreign minister, with the occasion of which he explained that the U.S.S.R. will not meet South Korean wishes, the economic domain included. He noted however that the meeting, regardless of the results, constituted a political contact nevertheless. 2. In support of Kim Yong-sik’s declaration, radio broadcasts in South Korea report that Henry Kissinger told the Chinese leadership on the occasion of his visit to Beijing that the Seoul authorities would like to establish contacts and normalize relations with the People’s Republic of China.Chinese diplomats in Pyongyang reject the possibility of having Seoul’s message relayed to Beijing, but [sic!] they reject all possibilities to establish a Sino-South Korean link, irrespective of its nature.Signed: Aurelian Lazar\n",

      "OneLate in 1949, soon after the establishment of New China, Chairman Ho Chi Minh and the Central Committee of the Indochinese Communist Party (ICP) wrote to Chairman Mao and the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), asking for Chinese assistance. In January 1950, Ho made a secret visit to Beijing to request Chinaʼs assistance in Vietnamʼs struggle against France.Following Hoʼs visit, the CCP Central Committee made the decision, authorized by Chairman Mao, to send me on a secret mission to Vietnam. I was formally appointed as the Liaison Representative of the CCP Central Committee to the ICP Central Committee. Comrade [Liu] Shaoqi personally composed a letter of introduction, which stated: ʻI hereby recommend to your office Comrade Luo Guibo, who has been a provincial Party secretary and commissar, as the Liaison Representative of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. He is accompanied by eight staff members. Liu Shaoqi, Chief Secretary, Central Committee, 17 January 1950.ʼAt that time, Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou Enlai were in Moscow conducting negotiations with the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union headed by Joseph Stalin. Their visit resulted in the Sino-Soviet Treaty on Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance.I secretly left Beijing for Vietnam in January 1950. Comrade Shaoqi told me at the time of my departure that I would return to Beijing after my three-month mission. Because of altered conditions in Vietnam, however, I was away for eight years. In Vietnam, I lived through a second eight-year War of Resistance, a war in which my enemies were French rather than Japanese.TwoI first returned to Beijing from the mountainous base area in northern Vietnam on 24 September 1950, eight months and seven days after I had left. After preparing a report on my work in Vietnam following the official format, I sent it to the leaders of the Central Committee, following oral instructions from Comrade Shaoqi and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De. Two or three days later, Comrade [Yang] Shangkun told me that Comrade Shaoqi had invited me to his office. I once again visited the familiar offices of the Zhongnanhai compound. After Comrade Shaoqi told me that Chairman Mao himself was waiting to hear my debriefing, he and I were taken by car to Fengzeyuan. Fengzeyuan was the village in Beijing where the Kangxi Emperor had officiated at the annual spring ploughing ceremony. We visited the Emperor’s former resting place at Fengzeyuan, which was a typical traditional compound containing two courtyards. Flowering crab-apple trees and pear trees were symmetrically planted on each side of the outer courtyard. There were no other decorations. The atmosphere was solemn and awe-inspiring. There was a large reception room called Yinian Hall, and on the eastern and western sides of the compound were rooms named “Picture of Mist and Rain” and “Painting of Clouds and Mountains.” Simple and unadorned, they were Chairman Mao’s personal living quarters. The reception hall, in contrast, was rather luxurious inside. The ceiling, doors, and window-frames were made of carved mahogany. But the furnishings were sparse, with about a dozen easy-chairs surrounding a small table standing on old carpet at the center of the room. A long, narrow table stood behind the chairs. About half the floor space was completely empty. Such were the plain and simple reception areas and living quarters which served the chairman of our Party and of the People’s Republic of China. In those days, moreover, official meetings were conducted without much ceremonial protocol.  On the many occasions when I presented reports to Chairman Mao, the Chairman would sit in one of the chairs on the southern side of the room. I would sit just beside him, usually moving to a chair a little further away after finishing my report.  On this occasion, Commander-in-Chief Zhu De and Premier Zhou were sitting beside Chairman Mao when Comrade Shaoqi led me into the room. Comrade Shaoqi began by presenting a brief of my report. When he had finished, Chairman Mao stood up and addressed me, saying: “Comrade Truong Chinh, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Communist Party, has sent a telegraph requesting your return to Vietnam. Ho Chi Minh has invited you to be his Adviser-General. You will need to become mentally prepared for an extended tour of duty in Vietnam.” At that point Comrade Shaoqi broke in to say, “Originally, you were assigned to a three-month mission to Vietnam. But that plan must be modified. We must make long-term plans!” Premier Zhou then informed me: “The Central Committee has made an internal decision to nominate you as our first ambassador to Vietnam.” Chairman Mao confirmed this, adding, “You will continue your work as a bridge between the Chinese and Vietnamese Communist parties. You are our Party’s first, and possibly the sole, Liaison Representative to Vietnam.”Premier Zhou and Commander-in-Chief Zhu then briefed me on the invasion of Korea by the American imperialist power and the formation of an army of Chinese volunteers prepared to assist Korea. They also delegated me to convey these details on the Korean conflict to Ho Chi Minh and the Central Committee of the Indochinese Communist Party.Chairman Mao then declared: “In view of the situation in Korea, we have made the decision to assist the Koreans in their struggle against the United States. Our Volunteer Army will go openly into Korea; Chinese troops will fight shoulder to shoulder with Korean soldiers to resist the American invasion. Considering the situation in Vietnam, we have decided to provide covert assistance in the struggle against France by providing military aid, economic and financial assistance, and advisory support. Although China’s assistance is taking a different form in Vietnam from that in Korea, in both cases China’s support is internationalist and patriotic. We are committed to assisting Korea and Vietnam equally, and consider both tasks to be equally glorious. Mao then abruptly changed the subject to ask me about my wife and family. When I told him that my wife had joined the Red Army in 1933 and was a survivor of the Long March, the Chairman said cheerfully: “Well then, she is a battle-tested veteran. Very good! What work has she been doing?” I answered: “She has worked in internal security, administration, and cadre affairs.”  Chairman Mao’s immediate reply was: “Good! Then please take her with you when you return to Vietnam to act as your assistant. Ho Chi Minh has urged me to allow our advisors to take their wives with them. As long as a spouse is suitable for the mission, I will agree to let her go.” Later on, a few of the other Chinese advisers in Vietnam were also accompanied by their wives.Comrade Shaoqi then said: “Financial problems, especially as they affect food supplies and currency, are presently the most urgent problems in Vietnam. We have selected several cadres with experience in finance, banking and grain supply work to serve as advisors in Vietnam. They will travel with you as an initial contingent. We will then select advisors in other fields and organize them into a Political Advisory Delegation to help the Vietnamese. You are the Advisor-General and will also be the head of China’s Political Advisory Delegation to Vietnam.”  Hearing Liu Shaoqi using the term “Advisor-General,” Chairman Mao said, “Be careful not to follow the Soviet Union’s negative example in your work as the Advisor-General. You must remember that Vietnam is not China. Do not attempt to simply replicate Chinese methods. Remember that the particular conditions found in Vietnam must be the foundation of every approach. Be honest and sincere with the Vietnamese. As well as telling them about our successful revolutionary experiences, be sure also to relate the details of our setbacks and painful lessons.” The debriefing meeting was my first opportunity to receive directly Chairman Mao’s guidance and instructions on international affairs.ThreeOur first step in assisting Vietnam was to break through the French defences along the Sino-Vietnamese border so as to establish direct links between China and areas controlled by the Viet Minh. Thus we would be able to ship supplies directly into Vietnam. The French forces would lose their primary advantage as soon as the People’ Army of Vietnam (PAVN) were to control the strategic passes and routes across the border. There were two possible means of breaking through the French defences. The first was to capture the town of Cao Bang, on the border of China’s Guangxi Province; the second was to capture Lao Kay, on the border of Yunnan Province. Or would it be best to attack both towns simultaneously? The ICP Central Committee and the CCP Central Committee spent nearly three months in negotiations before agreeing on a plan of attack.  On 2 July 1950, Chairman Mao responded to the ICP Central Committee in a telegram: “I endorse the proposal to capture Cao Bang first. Regarding the detailed plan of operations for the attack on Cao Bang, wait for the arrival of Chen Geng and then make your final decision after discussing the matter with him. As for continuing operations, you will need to make decisions based on your actual situation. When we provide views, they are only for your reference. This is because you are more familiar than we are with your own circumstances.”Comrade Chen Geng was the Chinese general personally selected by Ho Chi Minh to assist Vietnam. After Ho requested General Chen’s help from Chairman Mao and our Party’s Central Committee, Chen Geng was sent to Vietnam as the representative of the CCP Central Committee with a mandate from Chairman Mao and the Central Committee to help organize forces and lead them in the Border Campaign in which our Military Advisory Delegation was preparing to play a part. Chairman Mao paid close and careful attention to the crucial Border Campaign. Many important telegrams had to pass through his hands and receive his personal approval. He even drafted telegrams himself. During the period of preparations for the Border Campaign, Chairman Mao and the CCP Central Committee consented to the request of Ho Chi Minh and the ICP Central Committee for permission to move PAVN troops into the Wenshan area of Yunnan Province, for resting, re-equipping, training, and re-organizing. The Chinese advisors helped to reorganize these troops into two large regiments or divisions, thus transforming them into two strong fists. The two reorganized units played a crucial role in the Border Campaign. In accordance with Mao’s instructions, Chen Geng rendered invaluable and selfless assistance in the campaign, helping the Vietnamese people and armed forces win a decisive victory. The victory brought the Vietnamese forces out of their defensive phase and consolidated cross-border communications between China and Vietnam. Ho Chi Minh, Vo Nguyen Giap, and other Vietnamese leaders were elated by the victory.  On 14 October 1950, immediately after the battle, Ho Chi Minh wrote to Comrade Mao Zedong and the CCP, reporting: “We have won a complete victory in the Battle of That Khe and Cao Bang. The all-out assistance of the CCP and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has been the principal cause of this victory. Comrades from the provinces of Yunnan, Guangxi,  and Guangdong carried out your instructions precisely and wholeheartedly, providing us with direct assistance in disregard of their own hardships. I would like to point out the exceptional contributions to the victory made by comrades Chen Geng, Song Renqiong, Zhang Yunyi, Li Tianyao, Luo Guibo, Ye Jianying, Fang Fang, Wei Guoqing and the other comrades of the Advisory Delegation. In brief, I believe this to be a victory of Mao Zedong’s revolutionary internationalist road. I will not say conventional words of thanks to express our gratitude. Instead I must declare that the Vietnamese comrades and people will surely fulfill the lofty expectations and repay the enormous assistance that we have received from our brothers in the Communist Parties of China and the Soviet Union with further endeavors toward a greater and final victory.”FourI returned to China to report to the CCP Central Committee. As I was reporting a Vietnamese request for further assistance from China, Chairman Mao said: “Because the Chinese people have won a revolutionary victory, we now have an obligation to help the peoples whose countries have not yet been liberated: this is internationalism. Vietnam is struggling in a war of resistance against French aggression, but remains isolated, lacking the assistance of others. In this difficult time, Vietnam is looking to us for help. We are obliged as revolutionaries to provide assistance to Vietnam that is selfless, free of charge, and completely without political strings attached. Thus China will provide to the Vietnamese anything that they need which is in our possession.”  Chairman Mao then continued, “Not only are the French colonialist aggressors the enemies of the Vietnamese people; they are also our foes. France is the common enemy of the peoples of China and Vietnam. China’s assistance to Vietnam is helping to defeat the French colonialist aggressors. To help restore peace in Vietnam is China’s help to our neighbour. In return, by defeating the French colonialist aggressors and driving them out of Vietnam, Vietnam will help China by freeing our southern border of the threat of France’s colonialist aggression. Thus we should not one-sidedly refer only to China’s help to Vietnam; we must say that Vietnam is also helping China; the assistance is mutual. When I stated that Vietnamese expectations for assistance from China were overly ambitious, demanding, and out of touch with reality, Chairman Mao said: “Perhaps their lack of understanding of conditions in our country, and in their own as well, may account for their ambitious, demanding, and impractical requests for a program of aid from China. Another explanation might be their lack of experience. You must assist them with patience.” During the years of my stay in Vietnam, the guidance and instructions provided by Chairman Mao and the CCP Central Committee were implemented faithfully in our programs of assistance. These programs ranged widely, including the provision of weapons and military equipment, along with supplies of food, clothing, medicine and medical services, communications equipment, and vehicles. Thus not only did we offer our guidance by recounting and sharing the experience of the Chinese revolution, we also provided both frontline combat assistance and base logistical services in Vietnam.The Chinese advisors in Vietnam worked with a sincere and whole-hearted commitment, making selfless contributions to the course of the Vietnamese people’s revolution. In accordance with Chairman Mao’s instructions, we asked for no compensation in the form of services or payments during our stay in the country. Living, working, and fighting shoulder to shoulder with our Vietnamese comrades, we shared their hardships and happiness. Likewise, the Chinese government supported Vietnam without requesting repayment in any form. China did not impose any unequal treaty or agreement on Vietnam, and did not maintain any military bases or deploy a single soldier in Vietnam. China’s assistance and support was free and selfless, demonstrating clearly the greatness of Chairman Mao’s internationalism. Internationalism in this spirit is rare in the world.   FiveDuring the winter of 1951, Ho Chi Minh paid another secret visit to Beijing. One day I escorted him to Yinian Hall at Fengzeyuan. As we approached the gate, Chairman Mao, Comrade Shaoqi, Premier Zhou Enlai, and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De all came out to meet Ho. They greeted him with friendly embraces. Ho had already got to know Chairman Mao, Comrade Shaoqi, Premier Zhou, and Commander-in-Chief Zhu during the China’s First Revolutionary Civil War of China and later during the War of Resistance against Japan. His Cantonese-accented Chinese was so fluent that an interpreter was not needed. The meeting proceeded with intimate warmth rather than conventional diplomatic formalities, as though Ho had just been reunited with his own family.Ho greeted Chairman Mao like a long-lost brother. After cordial greetings and an exchange of courtesies, they soon started to discuss important issues. Ho Chi Minh made a succinct presentation on the current situation in the war of resistance against France, the progress of building revolutionary base areas, and the work of the Chinese advisers in Vietnam.  Premier Zhou and Commander-in-Chief Zhu then presented brief reports on the Korean War situation and China’s domestic affairs. At one point during their conversation, Ho Chi Minh addressed Chairman Mao: “Our Politburo hoped that Comrade Luo Guibo would criticize us more and offer more guidance as a participant in our Politburo meetings, but he has been overly modest and cautious. We hope that you will instruct him to criticize us more thoroughly. Chairman Mao, will you agree to do so?“Certainly,” said Chairman Mao, “But his criticisms, ideas, and suggestions are for your reference only. Keep in mind those that you consider correct, while rejecting those that do not seem correct. The decisions are up to you.”Chairman Mao’s conversation with Ho Chi Minh continued in an informal manner. But Chairman Mao expressed his views and preferences in a way that dissolved them into a home-style chat. Although their conversation might have seemed casual and relaxed, however, the content was actually profoundly significant. Ho Chi Minh, a man of strong emotion, appeared deeply moved by Mao’s sincerity. Getting to his feet, he declared: “My Vietnamese comrades and I are convinced by Chinese actions that it is with true sincerity that you have assisted us.” It was time for lunch. Chairman Mao, Chairman Ho, Comrade Shaoqi, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and I entered the dining hall together. Premier Zhou took his leave to keep appointments with foreign visitors. The dining hall was an area separated from the meeting room with a screen, leaving space for two tables. We found just one table there. During the lunch, Chairman Mao, Chairman Ho, Comrade Shaoqi and Commander-in-Chief Zhu conversed continuously, commenting, interjecting, and amicably interrupting one another.   Hot chilli peppers were served with the lunch. Seeing the chillies, Chairman Ho said to Chairman Mao: “Comrade Luo Guibo has told us that you like chillies so much that you have no appetite without them. Is this true?” Chairman Mao smiled as Ho continued: “We Vietnamese also like to eat chillies. But the chilli plants in Vietnam are different from those in China. They are one or two meters high, like small trees. The chillies grow facing upwards, heading towards sky. They are truly hot-tasting…” Everyone listened with great interest to Ho’s description of the small skyward-growing chilli peppers of the forests of northern Vietnam. Chairman Mao then said, “I am not the only one here who loves to eat chillies. Comrade Shaoqi and I are both from Hunan Province and like chillies like typical Hunanese. Commander-in-Chief Zhu is from Sichuan; the people from Sichuan love chillies as well.” Referring to me, Chairman Mao continued: “He is from Jiangxi Province; the people of Jiangxi are also very fond of chillies. So are the people of Yunnan, so close to Vietnam. But although we all like to eat chillies, we have various ways of preparing them.” We all then began to describe the particular methods of preparing chillies followed in our native places, with Vietnamese methods attracting the most interest. Ho Chi Minh explained that the Vietnamese custom was to pickle the skyward-facing chillies in fish sauce and a little lemon juice. Chairman Mao interjected at this moment to say: “Actually our addiction to chilli peppers is not the result of local customs. During the period from 1932 to 1934, the Guomindang imposed a strict trade embargo against our Central Soviet Region. A severe shortage of salt resulted. In order to bring in salt supplies, some comrades paid a very high price; some even sacrificed their lives. How we struggled then!  Meals without salt were tasteless. Many comrades, including myself, substituted chillies for salt. A dish missing salt but served with chillies was considered a good meal!”Although so many years have passed, our conversation about chillies still seems like something that happened just yesterday.SixAfter seeing off Ho Chi Minh, Chairman Mao, Comrade Shaoqi and Commander-in-Chief Zhu asked me to stay for further discussion.  Chairman Mao instructed me: “State your views and offer criticisms whenever Comrade Ho Chi Minh invites you to Politburo meetings and solicits your opinions. But you must make it clear that your ideas and suggestions are intended only for reference by the Vietnamese leaders. You must emphasize study and investigation, avoiding a subjective attitude. You must take specific conditions in Vietnam as your starting point when seeking to apply Chinese experiences, and avoid trying to transfer Chinese methods unmodified. You must be very cautious when you put forward your criticisms and suggestions. You must consider your remarks carefully, introduce them appropriately, and take responsibility for what you say. To help the Vietnamese, you must help them properly. Be sure never to impose your views. You must be very respectful of Comrade Ho Chi Minh and the other leaders of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labour Party. Never behave like an imperial envoy and be particularly careful not to assume a big-power chauvinist attitude. Your tendency to be cautious is correct.” Comrade Shaoqi and Commander-in-Chief Zhu then said, “Remember the limits of your mandate, and be sure not to exceed them. Always report to Chairman Mao and the CCP Central Committee on important issues as they arise or after decisions are made.” Chairman Mao’s expression became more serious and emotional. He said to me, “You were in the Central Soviet Region before the Long March. You must remember Li De.”“Yes,” I replied. “Li De is a German,” Chairman Mao continued, “He fought with the Red Army and was decorated during the October Revolution. Winning Stalin’s trust, he was sent to assist the CCP and arrived in the Central Soviet Region to serve as a military adviser. Before long, he obtained commanding authority over the Red Army of Chinese Workers and Peasants. Li De’s leadership caused enormous damage to the cause of the Chinese revolution. He did not understand the specific conditions in China or the Chinese Red Army’s situation. He did no studying or research to understand the situation, and ignored views different from his own. His approach was to transplant, directly and without modification, tactics and strategies that had been effective in the Soviet Union but were completely impractical in China. With his mandate from the Communist International, however, he was able to bully and intimidate everyone. In short, Li De was arrogant, commandeering, insistent, and coercive, just like an old-fashioned imperial envoy. Together with Bo Gu and other followers, Li De implemented a series of erroneous military strategies and tactics, causing us great suffering and costing a shocking price in blood.”Chairman Mao continued: “Remember the lesson of Li De’s behaviour in China while you are working in Vietnam. Be sure also to speak about it to all your comrades in the Advisory Delegation. Encourage every one of them to keep it in mind by telling them that our assistance to Vietnam will not take the form of replicating our previous approaches, nor of direct transplantation; our help must actually help the Vietnamese become better off. Assistance will not be effective if Chinese advisors hold subjective expectations. Their assistance will only be effective if they recognise the specific situation in Vietnam and remain modest and cautious. They should seldom mention our victories and frequently discuss our setbacks. We have experienced defeats. As part of your work providing assistance to Vietnam, be sure to monitor and review all that you say and do. Follow a routine of reviewing your words and deeds every day, or once every three days, or at least once a week, so as to keep clearly in mind how you are proceeding correctly, and in what ways you might be deviating.” “As for Comrade Ho Chi Minh,” Mao continued, “he enjoys the respect of the peoples of both China and Vietnam; internationally, he is even respected by his opponents.” It was of great significance that Chairman Mao elevated Ho to such a lofty position; his praise made a deep impression on me. Thus Mao provided me with an extremely profound and at the same time very practical lecture on proletarian internationalism.SevenTo Chairman Mao, the Vietnamese people’s anti-colonial revolutionary cause was just as important as the Chinese people’s revolutionary cause; he was committed to aiding Vietnam in a spirit of thorough internationalism and selfless sacrifice. Not only did he instruct me and the others in the advisory delegation in this spirit, Chairman Mao also demonstrated it to us by his deeds. Chen Geng, Wei Guoqing and I communicated by telegram with Chairman Mao and the CCP Central Committee when asking for their instructions. Our communications were on a wide range of important matters including military operations (such as the Border Campaign, the Battle of Dian Bian Phu, and the Battle for the Northwest), the expansion and training of the Vietnamese armed forces, the strengthening of the Party ideologically and organizationally, economic and financial affairs, agrarian reforms, military support, public security, intelligence, and relations with ethnic minority groups. Chairman Mao read, modified and signed all telegrams sent to and received from Chen, Wei, and myself. He drafted particularly important telegrams with his own hand. Whenever Ho Chi Minh and the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Workers’ Party sent telegrams to Chairman Mao and the CCP Central Committee seeking advice, Chairman Mao and the Central Committee would send suggestions by return telegram. In important messages, Chairman Mao invariably noted, “Our views are for your reference only. Decide for yourselves; you understand the situation better than we do.” Comrade Wang Jiaxiang chaired a team within the Liaison Department of the CCP Central Committee, drafting a set of provisional regulations to be followed by Chinese advisors in Vietnam. Chairman Mao made important additions when he edited the draft, including: “Take care of every piece of grass and wood belonging to the Vietnamese people; respect the independence of the nation of Vietnam and the customs of the Vietnamese people; support the Vietnamese Workers’ Party and Comrade Ho Chi Minh, the leader of the Vietnamese people.” Thus the words of the regulations were filled with the internationalist spirit of Chairman Mao and the CCP Central Committee. When I returned to China in 1952 to present a routine duty report, I reported to Chairman Mao that most of the Chinese advisors were stable in their work in accordance with the instructions of Chairman Mao and the CCP Central Committee and in the spirit of internationalism. A few of them, however, had not become accustomed to the humid tropical climate in Vietnam, to the mosquitoes, or to the different way of life. Some were frequently ill, suffering from malaria and significant weight loss.  Moreover, exposed so often to ground combat and French aerial bombardment, these advisors were afraid that they would lose their lives in Vietnam. They hoped for or had applied for early transfers back to China.On hearing this, Chairman Mao fell into a silence. After a while, he spoke quietly: “Norman Bethune was a Canadian who travelled thousands of miles to reach China, determined to help the people of China in their resistance to the Japanese invasion. Seeking nothing for himself, he was willing to sacrifice all he possessed. Bethune exemplifies the spirit of internationalism. He died a hero and was buried in China. He was an outstanding internationalist combatant whom we will honor and remember forever.”Chairman Mao continued: “Many of our Party comrades are northerners who have worked, fought, and settled in southern China. Some have sacrificed their lives in the South. Meanwhile, many southerners have worked, fought, and settled in the North; some of them have also given their lives. All of our advisors in Vietnam are CCP members sent by our Party to help the Vietnamese in their struggle against France. Why should they not go on working, fighting, and living in Vietnam? Why should they not die in Vietnam?” Chairman Mao then recited two lines from a classical poem: “A loyalist may be buried in any place; is it necessary to carry home his horse-skin-wrapped remains?”11 He then interpreted the meaning of the verse for me.EightSecure food supplies and an effective currency system were important goals in China’s program of assistance to Vietnam. They were defined as early as March 1950 when Ho Chi Minh, Truong Chinh, Pham Van Dong, and Vo Nguyen Giap briefed me on the situation in Vietnam. They identified the food and currency issues as the most urgent and intractable of the problems for which they sought our help.  I reported the food supply and currency problems to Chairman Mao and the CCP Central Committee. Chairman Mao and Comrade Shaoqi responded and provided instructions. They argued that the fundamental solution to the economic and financial problems in Vietnam, especially those related to food and currency, was to uproot the old financial and economic systems that the French colonialists had set up and continued to control, and to replace them with new systems. Chairman Mao and Comrade Shaoqi referred to the CCP’s experience. During the War of Resistance to Japan and the War of Liberation, the CCP had developed a set of financial and economic policies to resolve these problems effectively. The policies included the imposition of grain-tax levies, the withdrawal of currency from circulation, and the encouragement of manufacturing. Chairman Mao and Comrade Shaoqi told me that these policies were in general suitable for Vietnam and could serve as a reference. Following instructions by Chairman Mao and Comrade Shaoqi, the advisors and I began to help reform the Vietnamese systems of food supply and currency. We introduced Chinese experiences to the Vietnamese and adapted them to fit the situation in Vietnam, thus helping them to establish their own systems. This work ranged from macro-level strategy and policy-making, to discipline building in the form of charters, regulations, and directives, and to implementation orders and operations. As a result, the Vietnamese financial and economic situation had improved conspicuously by 1951. Soldiers and civilian staff had food on their tables and were no longer suffering from hunger. The civilian population also had more to eat. The Vietnamese currency was stabilized and inflation was halted. Markets gradually became lively. Ho Chi Minh, Pham Van Dong, Truong Chinh, and Vo Nguyen Giap were all pleased with these developments. As Premier Pham Van Dong declared in 1951, “Chairman Mao and the CCP have assisted us selflessly, sending advisers to help us win a strategic victory in the Border Battle of 1950, and thus decisively altering the situation of our War of Resistance. Now the Chinese advisors have helped us solve our most difficult and urgent problems—the financial and economic headaches, especially relating to food, currency and production. This assistance demonstrates the great internationalism of Chairman Mao and the CCP, and reveals the effectiveness of Mao Zedong Thought and the revolutionary experience in China as they have been applied in Vietnam.” NineFollowing the Border Campaign of 1950, we waged many more campaigns and fought many battles, including the battles in the Middle Red River [December 1950-January 1951], Ninh Binh [May-June 1951], the Battle of the Northeast [March-April 1951], Upper Laos [March-May 1953], the Northwest [October-December 1951], the Red River Delta Partisan Campaign, and Dian Bian Phu [March-May 1954].  Finally, the French colonial aggressors were forced to sit at the negotiation table in Geneva and accept a ceasefire agreement.  The Vietnamese people had at last won their decisive victory. It was during the experience of the Vietnamese war against the French that Comrade Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese Workers’ Party, and the Vietnamese people came to understand Comrade Mao Zedong’s internationalism. Responding to the spirit of Mao Zedong’s great internationalism, the Vietnamese people respected Comrade Mao Zedong so much that they called him “Uncle Mao,” displaying sincere feelings. “Uncle” was the same respectful and affectionate term used by the Vietnamese people to refer to Comrade Ho Chi Minh. History is the fairest judge and best reference. Despite the passage of time and changes in the world situation, Mao Zedong’s proletarian internationalist thought and his contributions to the Vietnamese victory against France will live forever in the history of the Vietnamese struggle for national liberation.  \n",

Molotov and KorobovExcerpt from Minutes Nº 19 of the CC Presidium meeting of 24 July 1953Draft Telegram to North Korea Concerning the Issue of the Participation of Cde Kim IlSung in the Signing of the Armistice AgreementApprove the attached draft of the telegram on this issue submitted by the USSR Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Cde. Molotov)CC SECRETARY Nº 342Telegram from the Soviet Minister of Foreign Affairs to the Soviet ambassador to the DPRK with recommendations of the CPSU CC to the Chairman of the Cabinet of Ministers of the DPRK not to take part in the signing of the Armistice Agreement in Korea24 July 1953ref. point 9 of Minutes Nº 19NORTH KOREATO THE SOVIET AMBASSADORPass the following to Kim Il Sung and the Korean friends: the CPSU CC is in favor of the armistice in Panmunjom being signed by one of the deputies to the prime minister of the DPRK and Peng Dehaui for the Chinese-Korean side. Kim Il Sung himself is not obligated as Prime Minister to personally sign the armistice. The solution of the issue of who will sign the armistice for the Chinese-Korean side belongs entirely and completely to the governments of the DPRK and PRC and should not by any means be dependent on pressure from the Americans, etc.In present conditions a trip by Kim Il Sung to Panmunjom is fraught with a certain risk in view of the behavior of the South Koreans, who might resort to some sort of provocation against Cde. Kim Il Sung. The interests of the matter require precluding the slightest possibility of such a provocation from the South Koreans and this might be ensured by Kim Il Sung not personally taking part in the signing of the armistice at Panmunjom. On this issue the CPSU CC does not advise yielding to any other considerations since these considerations are of secondary importance in this situation. But, of course, Kim Il Sung's refusal to go to Panmunjom need not be ostentatious. And what is more, just because Kim Il Sung will not go to Panmunjom it is extremely important that Cde. Peng Dehuai be in Panmunjom to personally sign the armistice together with a deputy prime minister of the DPRK.The CPSU CC does not think that the Americans will manage to use the failure of Kim Il Sung to go to Panmunjom in any way to postpone the signing of the agreement. The postponement of the signing of the agreement for such a reason would not receive the support of international public opinion.We think that there is no need to fear an unfavorable impression on the Korean and Chinese peoples if Kim Il Sung does not personally sign the armistice agreement. We have no doubt that the Korean and Chinese friends will be able to properly explain the situation if there is a need for this.These are the considerations to which the CPSU CC would like to direct the attention of the Korean and Chinese friends. We hope that these considerations will be taken into consideration.Inform Kim Il Sung and the Korean friends that we are sending the considerations mentioned above to [Beijing] at the same time to be passed to Cde. Mao Zedong and the Chinese friends.Telegraph when this is done.\n",

After the American answer has been received, you will receive additional instructions. Suggest to the American delegation holding the next meeting of the Joint Commission, at which you will announce that the Soviet delegation continues to insist on its proposals of 26 August. Then point out that the Soviet delegation, in an attempt to speed up the work of the Joint Commission on establishing the Provisional Korean Democratic Government, finds it necessary that the Commission immediately commence the implementation of those American proposals of 12 August and the Soviet proposals of 26 August with respect to which the positions of both delegations are close. Also propose that the Commission should immediately start reviewing the written proposals submitted by the democratic parties and pubic organizations, and that, after it has reviewed these proposals, it should start developing the structure of the Provisional Korean Democratic Government, as well as local government bodies (the Provisional Regulation), political platform, the procedure for selection of the government apparatus, as well as work on other issues.”Cde Molotov agrees.

      "MEETINGOF THE COMRADES HYSNI KAPO AND RAMIZ ALIA WITH THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COUNCIL OF STATE OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA, COMRADE ZHOU ENLAI, AT 11 A.M. OF THE DATE 27 JUNE 1962(At the meeting our side was also represented by our ambassador to the People's Republic of China, comrade Reis Malile, who also took the notes appearing below.)From the Chinese side the following were present: comrade Chen Yi, Deputy Chairman of the Council of State and Minister of Foreign Affairs; comrade Zhou Enlai, Deputy Chairman of the Council of State; comrade Wu Xiuquan, Deputy Director of the [International Department of the] Central Committee of the Communist Party of China; and comrade Luo Shigao, PRC ambassador to the People's Republic of Albania.Comrade Hysni Kapo: We have been received very warmly at every place we have visited around your country. I take this opportunity to express the gratitude of our party and people for everything that the Communist Party of China, the PRC government, and the Chinese people have done for our party and people. I would also like to transmit to you the greetings of comrade Enver Hoxha and comrade Mehmet Shehu, who wanted to come themselves, but could not make it for the reasons you already know.Comrade Zhou Enlai: I thank you for the kind words you expressed for our party, government and people, as well as for the greetings of comrade Enver Hoxha and comrade Mehmet Shehu. We, just like you, are preoccupied with the health of your comrade leaders, comrade Enver Hoxha and comrade Mehmet Shehu, because they are at the forefront of a difficult struggle against the imperialists and the revisionists. The Chinese party and people greatly admire your resoluteness; our hearts are continuously trained on you and we understand very well the situation you are currently facing. That is why it is a good thing that comrade Enver Hoxha and comrade Mehmet Shehu stay behind in Albania to lead this struggle. This is how our party and people also operate; they do not allow comrade Mao Zedong to leave the country, while the rest of us can. In the world the imperialist enemies still rule, in fact over an area larger than that governed by socialism. In many countries the reactionaries rule and in some socialist countries the revisionists, who follow in the footsteps of the imperialists, are in power. It is why, in these conditions, the movements of our leader comrades must be careful. But in the work of a party there is also a division of duties; some must stay behind to conduct their duty within the country's borders, and others must at times leave the country. Travel to the fraternal socialist countries must be conducted, but if the need should arise, we must also go to the enemies. How can you catch the tiger, if you do not go to his lair? For justice, for the truth, and for Marxism-Leninism, we must not hesitate, even to enter a bonfire. So we must also go to the enemy's home. You, the Albanians, are such people. We are also of the same kind. For example, in the year 1950 comrade Wu Xiuquan went to the UN and took part in the proceedings of the Security Council. Jiang Jieshi's [Chiang Kai-shek's] representative was also there. Comrade Wu Xiuquan did not go there with the hopes of changing American imperialism, but with the goal of letting the working masses of the world understand our position; he went there to raise our banner and to win the opinion of the world, and this was done despite the fact that the situation was difficult, since the war in Korea had only started three months previously. During the civil war we have fought against Jiang Jieshi [Chiang Kai-shek], but at that time we were also dealing with the issue of the war with Japan, which preoccupied us. It was easy for Jiang Jieshi to strike at the Japanese. But during the time that we were fighting against the Jiang Jieshists, we were also conducting talks with them to gain unification of all the forces of the country in the war against the Japanese imperialists. Even after the capitulation of Japan, the units that were led by comrade Chen Yi and comrade Li Xiannian continued the war against Jiang Jieshi, while I would continue talks and conduct negotiations with him. Later, I called those comrades and all three of us talked to the enemy, the Jiang Jieshists and the Americans. This shows our experience. Though we were fighting against the Jiang Jieshists, we were also talking to them.In the war against the Japanese we had three slogans: To fight against the Japanese and never capitulate; to preserve our unity and avoid division; and to progress forward steadfastly and avoid retreat. Jiang Jieshi could never oppose our slogans; he would not dare say that I want to capitulate or that I am against unity. By following this course, we thus won over the masses and isolated the Jiang Jieshists. We only had one adventure in this sector when comrade Mao Zedong went to Chongqing. This was a mistake by Stalin. In the telegram that Stalin sent us, he said that if comrade Mao Zedong did not go there, the Chinese nation would be wiped out and [Stalin] advised us not to continue the civil war. Can this not be called interference in our internal affairs? Either way, we respected his advice. Comrade Mao Zedong went there, but we continued the war. Later the war was interrupted and we used the time to strengthen our army, but when comrade Mao Zedong returned to Yan'an, Jiang Jieshi restarted the civil war.Still, even after this, we continued the talks with them. The delegation stayed in Nanjing until they were expelled. We did not leave before being expelled, though the building where our comrades were staying in Nanjing was surrounded by spies, but we dared to stay there because we knew that the Chinese people and party were behind us and because we were convinced that we would win.When our struggle for the liberation of the country was nearing a victorious end, Jiang Jieshi once again asked for talks with us. We accepted their proposal and their delegation came to Beijing. The conditions that we presented to their delegation were accepted by the delegation, but not by the government of Jiang Jieshi, because the Americans did not agree to them. So we continued our drive south. In the white books [sic] published by Kennedy, there are many documents on this event. The policy of our party is that we have two ways of achieving victory. The first way is through revolution. We are for armed war against the enemy. But we also have another way of doing this. We also do not refuse peaceful struggle. The only thing is that this must be supported by armed war. We have waged legal and illegal wars. We have great animosity toward the American imperialists, but in Warsaw we talk with their representatives. Even now we do not exclude the possibility of talks with Jiang Jieshi if he would like to send a delegation here. This is our tactic; this is Leninism. In the struggle that Lenin waged against the Second International, the division came only after [Karl] Kautsky published the book “Wilhelm II.” Lenin fought against him though he was in the minority. This has entered the tradition of our party since comrade Mao Zedong came to its helm.So we use two revolutionary methods and our experience has shown this to be effective. This is our experience in the struggle against imperialism, as well as in the struggle against modern revisionism. This is also how we have acted with India. Though our relations with India are now tense, we always leave the door open to talks. India is placed in a difficult position, because while we are for talks, they are against them. In order to have talks, India requested preliminary conditions – that we pull back – while we do not ask for any preliminary conditions, though this does not mean that during the meeting we would not set our conditions. This is how we gain the initiative. The conflict on the Sino-Indian border started in the year 1959 and in 1960 this conflict became more grave. We then invited [Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal] Nehru for talks, he answered negatively and asked that comrade Zhou Enlai go to Delhi for talks. At that time, the spirit of the official Indian leadership was hostile toward us; in fact the pictures of comrade Mao Zedong and comrade Zhou Enlai were torn publicly there. Despite this, comrade Mao Zedong and the Central Committee of our party decided that in that situation I should go to Delhi for talks. This placed Nehru in a passive position. We then placed six conditions on him for the solution of the Sino-Indian border problem, which they did not accept, but which they could also not dispute.The struggle against the modern revisionism should also follow this course. Though there have been two meetings of the communist and workers' parties in 1957 and in 1960, [CPSU First Secretary Nikita] Khrushchev does not change his revisionism; he now has the majority in the international communist movement; some peoples and some sister parties are now following him. In this situation we are for meetings so that we can defend our correct positions there and to place N. Khrushchev in a passive position. He (N. Khrushchev) does not dare publicly to oppose the principles of Marxism-Leninism and the need for unity in the international communist movement. This is how we can hold in our hands the banner of Marxism-Leninism and that of the [1957] Moscow Declaration.Now we, as the minority that understand Marxism-Leninism correctly, must work hard so that the masses of the party and of the peoples know the truth well, and then united with them, we can fight for the truth. To achieve this, time is needed as well as a long struggle, but in the end the undecided elements and the rightists will eventually come to our side too. In our struggle we must not only unify the leftist elements but the centrists as well, and even the rightists. In this way we will cause the decomposition of the revisionists. That is why we must not only fight against the revisionists in the ideological sense, but also in the international meetings of the parties, waging in them a continued and resolute fight. Of course, all that I am saying is drawn only from the experience of the struggle our party. We place this experience before you for judgment, using the principles of Marxism-Leninism as a starting point; you may then decide for yourselves. We always admire the manners of fighting your party uses, but at the same time we also present to you our party's experience of struggle and implore you to transmit this and our other thoughts to comrade Enver Hoxha and comrade Mehmet Shehu.As to the other sister parties of Asia, such as the Communist Party of Indonesia, the Korean Workers' Party, and the Vietnam Workers' Party, we think that their tactics are quite correct, as the delegation of our party that held talks with you previously also indicated. We must keep in mind that revisionism is now in power in many countries. The revisionists have severed diplomatic relations with you, and because of what they have done they are in a passive position. With these actions that he takes, N. Khrushchev does not gain any favor in the world. There are also some parties that think like N. Khrushchev, but that do not follow him, such as for example the Polish party that did not sever diplomatic relations with Albania. Keeping this in mind, you now have the initiative in hand.The peoples require that we have unity, that we have good relations with each other in the socialist countries. In the relations between the socialist countries, diplomats must be careful, because they represent their government, the people and their desires in the country where they have been assigned. You are in a positive situation not only in the area of diplomatic relations, but you are in such a position in the area of trade relations as well. We also have trade relations with the imperialists; in fact, we may do even more trade with the countries that have revisionists at their helm, but this must be done on the basis of the principle of equality and in the interest of the peoples. We desire to see that you develop trade with the socialist countries of Europe and with the Soviet Union. Such a thing will have a great influence on the peoples of these countries; it will be in the interest of all the peoples of socialist countries.In relation to economic problems, you expressed here your gratitude for the help we have given you. I am really sorry that the truth is that we do not have the ability to fulfill each and every one of your needs. We understand your condition well; you are a small country that cannot solve all of its problems, but we are certain that your country has an ancient tradition of perseverance in overcoming your difficulties and, based on your own forces, you will move forward. In this spirit, we try to fulfill our duty as much as possible in assisting to the development of your economy, but you must, first of all, rely on your own forces. For as long as your economy is not walking on its own feet, we will not be comfortable.While we are on the topic, I would like to inform you about our economic situation. China used to be a backward country, with a very weak economy, much weaker than even pre-revolutionary tsarist Russia. After our victory, the our economy's period of recovery was not very long, though the war very much destroyed our country. In our first five-year plan we did some initial work. In our second five-year plan, based on the specific situation in China, we laid down the general course for the construction of socialism. Our course of the three banners is a correct one. As to our industry, it is weak. We have constructed some objects in this sector, but we have yet to develop a full system for the production of all those items we need. A proverb says: I have the piano, but I do not have the violin. For example, in a plane production plant we cannot produce all the plane parts we need because we do not posses certain kinds of steel, in particular special steels for the production of MiG 17s, MiG 19s, and MiG 21s.. During all these years we have achieved some results, especially in conventional armaments, but are not yet able to produce everything.Comrade Chen Yi: This has been dependent also on the assistance that the Soviet Union has given us during the past 10 years. The assistance that the Soviet Union has given us has not been complete. For example, we produce training aircraft, but no helicopters. For the production of planes, we are forced to buy some of the parts from the Soviet Union. We produce televisions and movie equipment, but we have to buy some of the parts from the Soviet Union. We will need time before we are able to produce them on our own.Comrade Zhou Enlai: The level of mechanization in our country is still low; that of electrification is low as well. We are able to produce equipment [domestically] and during the last few years the number [of these products] has grown, but we are still unable to produce some key items; such things we are forced to import. Now we do not posses precision machinery; we will need time for those. In addition, the industrialization of the country also requires advanced agriculture, otherwise, the people cannot be supplied with foodstuffs and the raw material industry cannot be supplied with all it needs, either. During the last three years we have faced several natural disasters. This year our agricultural [production] will also not fare very well. As to summer production, this year's harvest will be lower than that of last year, because some places suffered from floods, while in other parts of the country we had severe droughts. As a result of the drought, it is possible that agricultural production will not be good in general. We had planned to have higher agricultural production this year, but no longer have hope for such an achievement, so this year we will once again be forced to import grains. This presents us with the problem of the procurement of the necessary foreign currency. We will buy only 10 tins of grain per capita, but this will mean that we will buy several millions tons of grain. The recovery of some of the industrial plants [weeds] this year will be slow. We have done some work toward the increase of agricultural production; we have decreased the number of clerks and workers and have sent many of them to the farms.Our market this year is better; we are seeing the initial results, but we will need a lot of time for the recovery of agriculture. Our industry was also hurt badly from the recall of the Soviet specialists. The Soviets did not consult with us on the recall of the specialists. As a result, thousands of specialists immediately left their work in the field. But this was, at the same time, a trial for our country so that we may draw lessons on how to walk on our own feet. We do not complain why others do not help us; China is a large country and we must increase our capacity to produce.The modern revisionists have created great difficulties for us, but the greatest difficulties for us come from the imperialists, because the greatest part of our border is shared with countries that are on the side of imperialism. For a long time now, the imperialists have coaxed these countries to form a crescent-shaped enclosure around China, but until now this has not happened yet. Now, American imperialism, seeing our difficulties, is inciting Jiang Jieshi against us, with the intention of having him attack the continent. (After this comrade Zhou Enlai explains the situation on the basis of the notice given by the Xinhua news agency, and then continues): We unmask the intrigues of the American imperialists and have undertaken military measures. If Jiang Jieshi should dare to attack us, we will eliminate him. We unmask the American imperialists through our propaganda on these issues. We also told them in the talks in Warsaw that if an attack should happen, [the Americans] will not escape from the responsibility. On this issue there are two possibilities. Keeping in mind our warning to them, the American imperialists and Jiang Jieshi might not undertake anything. But they might still try their hand at an attack and in that case we will liquidate them completely. We wanted to inform you about our situation. We have been born with difficulties and that is how we are growing. The same thing that is happening to us is also happening to you – you were born with difficulties and with difficulties are growing.In our third five-year plan we will continue to strengthen the defense and the economy of our country, and, in the end, we will once again walk with a great leap. Keeping in mind all the above, with a feeling of sorrow we say to you that in the economic relations between our two countries it is possible that we will not be able to fulfill our obligations to you before the deadlines. You are not an economic delegation, but I still wanted to inform you of this.As to the trade volume for 1962, it will reach 52 million new rubles. Of this amount, it is certain that 36 million new rubles, or 67% of the agreement, will be realized. In the amount that will not be realized, the following items are included:1) We cannot supply you this year with the grain that has yet to be delivered for the year – a total of 55,000 tons. The same goes for 900 tons of crude oil. It is possible that we will not be able to supply these articles to you. We wanted to consult with you on this.2) As to the goods which we should supply to you by purchasing them from other countries, they are not certain. The majority of them we will be unable to give to you, such as the lubricants, for example. The same goes for the goods we will procure from capitalist countries; since we do not have foreign currency, we will not be able to give them to you. 3) For some objects which we do not produce on our own and which are not very necessary, we wanted to consult with you about them.So, for this year we will not be able to fulfill the agreement we have with you. There is very little hope that the amount will reach over the 36 million new rubles. When comrade [Vice Chairman of the Council of Ministers] Abdyl Kellezi was here, we discussed these objects. After we discussed them further, and based on the production capacity of our country and the conditions of yours, we are of the opinion that until the end of the year 1964, with great travails, only 10 objects can be implemented; the other 19 objects can be categorized as such:For the nitrogen fertilizer plant, Italy refuses to give us the necessary technical data, so that object could not be secured. The same goes for the glass factory. For the other 17 objects, we think that you should build them later than the planned deadlines, in other words, you should extend them to sometime in 1966 and 1967, and even later. We are not able to build them within the deadline, because we are short in equipment. The same thing is also going on with Vietnam and the other countries to which we have promised assistance; we are forced to extend the deadlines with all of them. Of course, this may bring some difficulties to you, but we must take responsibility for this. On the other hand, we think that, judging from your workforce, you will not be able to fulfill all the construction required. This is our opinion, but your government does not accept this. You have announced these objects in your five-year plan, but the plan can also be amended and there are plenty of examples of this. Comrade Stalin has said that a suitable plan must be amended often. And now N. Khrushchev, as well as other socialist countries, amends their plans.In a few words, we are bringing you some difficulty in the economic relations between our countries. This is a truth that troubles us. We know that you have not come to China for this matter, but we beg you to transmit this matter to the ALP CC. We will cooperate through the Albanian embassy with the group of Albanian specialists that have come here.Comrade Hysni Kapo: You evaluated correctly the position of our party and the care that it must pay to its leadership. The CCP is very correct to thus protect comrade Mao Zedong who is not only yours, but also of the world communists, who see in him an eminent leader of international communist movement. Comrade Mao Zedong is the son of your people and your party, but all that he has done for Marxism-Leninism belongs to us all.Comrade Zhou Enlai: The same goes for your struggle and your leaders, who are also ours.Comrade Hysni Kapo: We understood well all that you said to us. All those parties that are led by Marxism-Leninism in their struggle, are the same in one way or another. To a certain degree, as far as our conditions have allowed, our party, during the war, has tried to draw in all the masses of the people. (Further on, comrade Hysni Kapo describes the policy of our party toward the National Liberation Front, and then continued): During the course of the national liberation war we have also entered into negotiations and talks with the heads of the reactionary organizations with the intention of drawing the masses into the war effort. Of course, when it becomes necessary, we must also go to the enemy to talk. A proof of this is the course of your party and its correct line. To a certain degree this is very similar to our country. In 1946, the People's Republic of Albania was recognized only by the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. The imperialists were organizing plots even at the UN and only the Soviet Union defended Albania there. A delegation of our country also went to the UN then to unmask American imperialism and its lackeys. This is similar to what you said that we must go to the lair of our enemy and strike him there. We all know what imperialism is, though should it become necessary, we know that we must also talk to our enemy.We also have other examples that show the policy of our party in this area. The position of Greece toward the People's Republic of Albania is well known. (Then comrade Hysni Kapo explains the relations of our country with Greece, and continues further): Despite the enemy stance of the Greeks, the ALP and our government have continually taken steps for the amelioration of our relations with Greece. (Further on comrade Hysni Kapo explained the stance of Yugoslavia toward our country and our efforts to achieve normal relations at the governmental level and on this, comrade Hysni Kapo said, we have used to the principle that one must also talk to the enemy as a starting point.)Our relations with the countries of the communist family are completely different from the relations we have with the countries that are ruled by other social systems. Within our family the Leninist rules and principles must always be respected. These rules and principles have been thrown away by N. Khrushchev. It is a fact that our party was publicly attacked as being traitorous, as anti-Marxist, etc.Comrade Zhou Enlai: The Second International also accused Lenin as being a traitor, as an agent of imperialism, etc., but he still took part in the meeting of the Second International because not all of the mass of communists saw its errors. According to our opinion, in the midst of the international communist movement, as well as between the socialist countries, the talks are necessary. N. Khrushchev made a big mistake in not inviting Albania to the 22nd Congress of the CPSU. The attacks that he initiated against you at that congress unmask him. In the meeting of the Warsaw Pact [Political Consultative Committee] that was held in February of 1960, N. Khrushchev called comrade Mao Zedong a “discarded shoe” (an old boot). This made us very happy, because by this N. Khrushchev showed that he is a revisionist. He has been slandering us for a long time now, but we nevertheless went to the 22nd Congress of the CPSU. The speech I read at the congress, at the behest of the CC of our party, was soft but with effect in the world. Our participation in the congress did not add to the weight of N. Khrushchev, but to that of the ALP. The participation of the other sister parties that stand on correct ground did not add to the weight of N. Khrushchev. Marxism-Leninism allows us to follow the above-mentioned tactic in the midst of the international communist movement as well, to take part in the unmasking of the enemies. We would be isolated without our participation in the meetings.Comrade Hysni Kapo: I thank comrade Zhou Enlai for the speech that he read at the 22nd Congress of the CPSU in defense of the ALP and of Marxism-Leninism.Comrade Zhou Enlai: The thanks you express are not necessary. The speech I read was necessary and it was held in the interest of the preservation of Marxism-Leninism.Comrade Hysni Kapo: When we speak of the Soviet-Albanian disagreements, the issue is not only at the disagreements themselves, it is an issue of Marxism-Leninism. We were hit at the 22nd Congress of the CPSU, but the arrows were intended for somewhere else as well. (Here comrade Hysni Kapo explained how these blows were also directed against the CCP.)Comrade Ramiz Alia: The handle of the hammer falls on Albania, but the head strikes China.Comrade Zhou Enlai: Yes, it is so. The main blow is directed against China. We have a proverb here that says: Let us strike at the oak, so that the mountain can hear.Comrade Hysni Kapo: Had N. Khrushchev invited us to the 22nd Congress, we would have taken part. The attack he initiated against us at this congress has neither frightened us, nor made us any weaker. In Albania there is a unity that has never been seen before in either the party, nor in the people. His attacks have strengthened us even more. In this a role is played by the correct line of our party and an external factor, the struggle of the sister parties in the defense of Marxism-Leninism and, above all, the struggle of the CCP, its assistance and the international solidarity.Comrade Zhou Enlai: The main help is the internal factor.Comrade Hysni Kapo: (Explains the issue related to the unity within our party, then continues on to say that) … we agree with what you (comrade Zhou Enlai) said that Lenin, despite the division between the parties in the Second International, continued to take part in its meeting. (Further on, comrade Hysni Kapo pointed out the situation at the Meeting of Bucharest [the conference of the Romanian Workers' 20-25 June 1960]).Comrade Zhou Enlai: Your support for our party at the Meeting of Bucharest was pivotal.Comrade Hysni Kapo: Both you and we knew beforehand what N. Khrushchev would bring up at this meeting and despite our participation. In addition, we also participated in the Moscow Meeting [November 1960] despite the difficult situation that had been created there. We took part there not because we thought that N. Khrushchev might change his thoughts and his stance, but because it was necessary for us to discuss the problems of our family. We should not have given the upper hand to the enemy by taking the first step in that direction. And N. Khrushchev stepped on the norms of the relations between the parties and of the Moscow Declaration; he organized the open attack on the ALP at the 22nd Congress of the CPSU.(Further on comrade Hysni Kapo describes the unequal situation in which our party has been put after the 22nd Congress of the CPSU and the situation it would have faced had it gone to the meeting; later he explained the reasons why the position of the ALP is correct and pointed out that the CCP stands on other conditions. He then said that on all the principal issue both of our parties stand on similar grounds and our points of view only differ in the issue of the meeting. But, comrade Hysni Kapo continued, we will transmit your thoughts to the Central Committee of our party. We have been led by the spirit of the friendship and sincerity that ties us every time we have expressed an opinion here.)You, comrade Zhou Enlai, spoke here about your economic situation. We are two bodies with one single heart; every difficulty of yours is felt by us too. We understood by the explanations that you gave that you placed your heart in our hand and did not keep any secrets from us. We understand very well the measures that you have taken.We are not empowered by the Central Committee of our party to talk with you about economic problems; the leadership of our party has entrusted us with discussing only the issue of the nitrogen fertilizer plant and only to see where we stand on the deadlines for the objects. As to the issues that you brought forth, we cannot express any opinion, but we think that the changes that you propose will bring extremely grave economic and political hardships to us, such as, for example, the failure to fulfill the agreement on bread supplies. We would never want to cause you to have less bread than us, but considering the conditions in which we find ourselves, we would ask that this issue, as well as the others, be looked at one more time.(Further on, comrade Hysni Kapo speaks in more detail to comrade Zhou Enlai about the imperative need for procuring grains and shows the real basis on why we asked for them. He also pointed out the need for deliveries of oils, of tubes, etc. Comrade Hysni Kapo then said to comrade Zhou Enlai that we understand the intent of your point that we must walk on our own feet, but because of the economic conditions of our country we are not able to achieve this at the moment, but we have mobilized all the working masses for the complete fulfillment of all the tasks of the 3rd five year plan.)Comrade Zhou Enlai: (Spoke once again and said that we should tap into our reserves.)Comrade Hysni Kapo: (Pointed out that we have very few reserves; that they are only enough for a time of war; and that in fact even from those we have already taken out for the first three months of the year with the hope that we could replace them with the assistance form China.)The decrease in the number of objects from 29 to 10 that you would like to do is very troublesome for us. You expressed the opinion that our plan might be overloaded. You have also expressed this opinion to comrade [First Deputy Premier] Spiro Koleka. We analyzed all these issues one by one at the Politburo and came to the conclusion that we have the power to construct all the objects that we have included in the plan. Comrade Abdyl Kellezi was sent here exactly for the conclusion of the agreements. The signing of the agreements with you calmed us because the objects that we will receive from you are the foundation of our third five-year plan for industry and if we could be given them, we have the power to build them. The failure to receive 19 objects would be a very damaging thing for us and that is why we plead with you to reconsider this issue. We will report to the Central Committee of our party about your point of view on this, but we can tell you beforehand that we know the situation and the effect that such a measure would have on us would be very grave.As to the nitrogen fertilizer plant, it was known for a while that it would come from other countries. If the Italians will not provide it, let us look somewhere to see if it can be found, because agriculture is also vital in our country and nitrogen fertilizers play an important role in agriculture.(Further on, comrade Hysni Kapo gives general information on the agriculture situation in our country. If we do not secure nitrogen fertilizers, he said, we will always have to import our bread. The change of plan will be a very grave thing for us to bear, especially when considering our political, economic, and geographic position. Comrade Hysni Kapo then pointed out our great needs in the area of strengthening our defenses and gave some details about the armed forces of the countries that surround Albania. He also pointed out that despite the economic weight that the armed forces place on the country, they are necessary for the security of our fatherland.)Comrade Zhou Enlai: I am aware of some of the things that you pointed out, but there are also some new things. First of all, on the issue of the defense I had known the information from the talks I have had with your comrades from the military delegations. Whatever potential for military materiel assistance we have had, we have given to you and we will continue to do some part in the future.We are convinced that the heroic Albanian people, led by the party will withstand all the enemies that will dare to attack your country. The issue here can be compressed into two main problems for you: [illegible] … fertilizers. We cannot fulfill the grain plan. For this year could you use some amount of grain from the military reserves? Whenever we will have freed foreign currency, we will replace all you use. The amount of grain that you would receive this year, we will give to you next year. We would like to help you with chemical fertilizers, but we are not able to solve the technical side of the production of the nitrogen fertilizers. The Italians refuse to give us the technology. Comrade Li Xiannian: We are still trying to procure it from the Italians. Comrade Zhou Enlai: We will still try to achieve something with the Italians. We assure you that whenever we manage to get the patents, we will first of all help you and then we will look into our needs. But if they do not give it to us, there is nothing we can do. We will also ask comrade [PRC Foreign Minister] Chen Yi to talk about this issue with the Italian firm MOTAI when he goes to Geneva [for the conference on Laos]. The faraway water cannot put out the fire that is nearby, goes a wise proverb of our people. Even if we get the technology, we will need 2, 3, or even more years before we can start producing [nitrogen fertilizers]. Comrade Hysni Kapo: (Points out that in no way can the small reserve of grains intended for the military be touched and gives an explanation of our country's great need for the nitrogen fertilizer plant. Then he adds that the gasification shop construction can be postponed for later, but that the other shops must start to be built now.)Comrade Zhou Enlai: We do not have the experience for this. This can only be done after we receive the documentation from the Italians.Comrade Hysni Kapo: Let us at least start building the thermal power station that will supply energy to the nitrogen fertilizer plant since we know the capacity it must have.Comrade Zhou Enlai: This also cannot be done. (Then he insists again that the nitrogen fertilizer plant needs a few years to be built) and you have an urgent need for chemical fertilizers. So I will speak with the comrades in the government so that we may furnish you with some next year and then do that again and again until the plant is constructed. 10,000 tons of chemical fertilizers spread on the fields will add 30,000 tons of grain. These are the proportions that we will use to supply you for the fulfillment of your needs.Comrade Hysni Kapo: (Asks one more time that all the issues that comrade Zhou Enlai brought forth be reconsidered once again.)Comrade Zhou Enlai: The thoughts that I brought forth to you are realistic. I think that we must share all the blessings and the misfortunes with each other. We will supply you with chemical fertilizers in the coming year; we will also give you the grain at that time. In the coming year we can give you up to 15,000 tons of chemical fertilizers. […]Now there is no other way we could operate; we will have to postpone them. What I have presented here is the reality and we implore you to transmit them to the Central Committee of your party and to your government. Most needed for you are the fertilizers and the grains; the industrial objects can be postponed. The most important thing is the agriculture. I say this once again because I know that this issue is worrisome for you.Comrade Hysni Kapo: (Points out the great worry that such a thing causes us.)Comrade Zhou Enlai: I was in northeast China trying to solve the bread problem. Many industrial and very important centers there we have closed and the workers have all been sent to work in the fields.Comrade Li Xiannian: We are responsible for all that we have said to you today, especially me who made promises to you. These last days I looked at the list of objects. We see that after they are all built, you will have a great need for a large workforce for them. By pulling all these forces from the village, your agriculture will become weaker.Comrade Hysni Kapo: (Explains that we already have these forces and that the problem has been well studied from all sides.) If the problem we face is that we cannot build the objects due to technical shortcomings, that is another thing, but as to the necessary workforce for the construction and then for the operation of these objects, we can procure it.Comrade Zhou Enlai: The main thing are the technical shortcomings; we simply are not able to [provide] it. We are your good friends, but we are also poor; we accepted your requests only after great deliberation.Comrade Hysni Kapo: For us it is better to have a poor friend who is good, such as we have in the CCP and the Chinese people, than to have a rich friend, but one that seeks to stick a knife into your back.\n",

      "SECOND MAIN ADMINISTRATION OF THE GENERAL STAFF OF THE SOVIET ARMYCIPHERED TELEGRAM No. 22834Copies: Stalin (2), Molotov, Malenkov, Beria, BulganinFrom BEIJING Received 17:20 13.8.1951SERIES \"G” TTO FILIPPOV [Stalin]Comrade FILIPPOV!I send you for familiarization the telegram received from Comrade Li Kenong on 12 August 4:00.\"To Comrade Mao Zedong.1. I received your telegram of 11 August 7:00.2. At the evening meeting the mistaken views of the enemy became even more intensified. The enemy considers that it is possible through pressure to force us to abandon discussion of the question of the 38th parallel. He has already four times expressed his wish to discuss a proposal about a military demarcation line and a buffer zone on the basis of the present line of the front and the present military situation.We consider that the goal of this is to avoid defeat in the area of propaganda but also secretly to show that he can alter his proposal. Taking this into account, in our statement in today's meeting we pursued the goal of striking a blow against his unfounded theory of refusal to discuss the question of the 38th parallel, and also tried to ascertain if he intended to abandon his unfounded proposal.At today's meeting the enemy displayed some interest in the portion of our statement where we tried to ascertain his intention. However, in his statement in the second half of the day the representative of the enemy expressed a strong [sense of] injustice and tried to lay on us the responsibility for the impasse that has been created in the negotiations.Our statement for tomorrow will be constructed on the basis of your instructions. The goal of the statement will be to smash this [claim of] injustice of the enemy, to unmask his capacity for deception and simultaneously to advance such questions as to force the enemy more clearly to express his position.The main goal of the statement is once again to underscore that if the enemy does not renounce his unfounded proposal, there will be no progress in the work of the conference. We consider that we can also express our wish to change the proposal about the buffer zone in the area of the 38th parallel as the military demarcation line only in such case as the enemy clearly gives us to understand that he abandons his earlier proposal.3. After the resumption of the work of the conference, the mistaken views of the enemy have become even more intensified and the enemy has become even more convinced that we yearn for peace, and therefore it is possible to get concessions from us. All this was possible to foresee.However, from the entire course of the conference and the general situation outside the conference it is apparent that it is not possible to force the enemy to accept the proposal about the 38th parallel. In the course of several days the enemy on the one hand will put pressure on us and try to force us to be the first to make a concession, and on the other hand will prepare for a possible breakdown in the conference.Therefore we consider it necessary to work out a definite resolution with regard to the 38th parallel.If our final goal consists of conducting a struggle for the principle of the determination of the 38th parallel as the military demarcation line and if in this regard we can admit only certain alterations, then we should have in mind a breakdown in the negotiations and we must prepare for this.In the opposite case we should have some kind of compromise position determined. Our past proposal, it is true, could not foresee the possible development of the present situation, but it is also not possible to win much time through action in accordance with your orders contained in the telegram of 17.7.51 about a concession to the enemy for the purpose of gaining time,4. We (Li Kenong, Deng Hua, Xie Fang and Qiao Guanua) suggest that the final goal of the enemy is to cease military operations at the present front line. In relation to this the enemy may allow small alterations.It is thus necessary for us to decide: to struggle for the 38th parallel and prepare for an end to the negotiations or, avoiding a breakdown in the negotiations, to carry on the struggle for the cessation of military operations and to study the question of the cessation of military operations at the present front line.Having studied, on the basis of the limited materials we have, the general world situation, the needs of our state and the fact that at present Korea cannot continue the war, we think that it is better to think over the question of cessation of military operations at the present front line than to carry on the struggle for the 38th parallel and bring the conference to a breakdown.In connection with this it is necessary to take into consideration that it is possible to gain some concessions from the enemy in the discussion of the proposal about cessation of military operations at the present front line.Thus it will be possible to secure 3-5 years time for preparation of forces.Of course, if the enemy does not in any way abandon his unfounded proposal, which he is at present insisting on, then we also intend to choose only the path of a schism.Having limited materials at our disposal, the situation has been studied superficially. We urgently ask your instructions for future actions.LI KENONG 12.8.51 4:00.\"MAO ZEDONGNo. 406113.8.51###\n",

      "SECOND MAIN ADMINISTRATION OF THE GENERAL STAFF OF THE SOVIET ARMYCIPHERED TELEGRAM No. 23256Copies: Stalin (2), Molotov, Malenkov, Beria, BulganinFrom BEIJING 01:30 27.8.1951SERIES “G”To Comrade FILIPPOV [Stalin]Comrade Filippov!In view of the fact that the enemy was not in a position to withdraw from the impasse created in the course of the negotiations on the question of a military demarcation line, he has undertaken a whole series of provocative actions.On August 19 enemy troops, dressed in civilian clothes, made a raid on our security forces in the neutral zone in Gaeseong [Kaesong], as a result of which one man was killed and one was wounded. After an investigation by representatives of both sides, the enemy in justifying himself stated that this was [committed by] partisans from the South Korean partisan detachment active in our region, and therefore he does not take any responsibility for this.After this, on the night of August 22, one enemy plane dropped nine bombs on the territory of the neutral zone in Kaesong and fired on the house where our delegation is quartered. Although American officers came to investigate that same night, the enemy impudently refused to acknowledge their actions and contended that the fragments and craters found there are not from air force bombs. After this, the enemy, contradicting the former, said that the raid was made by an unidentified plane.The enemy dared to make these impudent provocations because he considered that our side would not make a breakdown in the negotiations over this. He therefore wanted to use this measure to put pressure on us.Of course, it is possible [that it was] a South Korean secret service plan to break up the negotiations, but the possibility is excluded that Syngmann Rhee could send a plane to make an attack on Kaesong in the region of the building where the negotiations are being conducted on his own initiative, without agreement from the Americans. Therefore, the provocative acts of the enemy have caused us to make a decisive counter-strike.We have declared a temporary cessation of the negotiations until the enemy accepts responsibility for what has happened. The negotiations will not be resumed until we receive a satisfactory answer—we'll let them cool their heels. However, we do not want to take the initiative in declaring a breakdown in the negotiations.We suppose that the enemy will not openly acknowledge his provocative acts.The dragging out of the negotiations can end in two ways.First, the delay may bring the negotiations to a breakdown.We are forcefully preparing ourselves to resist a possible attack by enemy troops directly at the front. We are simultaneously strictly defending the ports on the western and eastern coast of North Korea from landings by the enemy. For the last several days enemy planes have passed through the area of the following cities on the China coast: Qingdao, Shanghai, Hangzhou. This was also done for provocative purposes.Simultaneously with this, the enemy wanted to reconnoiter the air defense of our coastal regions. With regard to this, we want to strengthen our command in Korea and the air defense of the cities located in the coastal region. In a subsequent telegram I will communicate to you a draft [plan] for sending Soviet military advisers to work with the Chinese volunteer troops in Korea.Simultaneously with this I will ask you about an additional delivery of artillery armaments.Second, it is possible that as a result of the delay in the negotiations the enemy will find the means to extricate [himself] from the impasse and an agreement will be reached on the question of a military demarcation line.At the present time we want to use the period of the break in negotiations for conducting a cold war in order to expose the impudent provocative acts of the enemy. However, we suppose that the enemy will not openly acknowledge his provocations.If after some period of time the situation will develop so that the enemy wishes to renew the negotiations, then we think that at our own initiative we can propose a way which would lead to a turn in the negotiations and to force the enemy to agree with this.Comrade Kim Il Sung suggests for the purpose of securing the neutral zone at Kaeseong to ask representatives of neutral states to participate at the conference as monitors and witnesses for the period of negotiations, as a necessary condition for the resumption of the negotiations. Moreover, these representatives can be used in the future as a control organ for the implementation of the ceasefire.How do you view this? Do you consider this necessary or do you have a better way? I ask your orders on the above.With greetings.Mao Zedong.[...]\n",

      "SECOND MAIN ADMINISTRATION OF THE GENERAL STAFF OF THE SOVIET ARMYCIPHERED TELEGRAM No. 16293Copies: Stalin (2), Molotov, Malenkov, Beria, BulganinFrom BEIJING Received 21:45 8.2.1952SERIES \"G\" TTO FILIPPOV [Stalin]I send you for familiarization the abbreviated text of the telegram to me from Peng Dehuai of 22.1 of this year and my answer of 4.2 of this year.The telegram of Comrade Peng Dehuai of 22.1 of this year.\"1. 16.1 of this year the Minister of Foreign Affairs of [North] Korea Pak Heon-yeong [Pak Hon Yong] was at my place. In a conversation he said that the Korean people throughout the country demand peace and do not want to continue the war.If the Soviet Union and China consider it advantageous to continue the war, then the Central Committee of the Workers' Party will be able to overcome any difficulties and hold to their position.I answered that a peaceful settlement on the basis of justice and rationality is advantageous for us. I also explained to him about the favorable conditions of our side in the present military situation and about the increase in the difficulties of America. Therefore an agreement on an armistice can be reached. However in military relations we will carry out active preparation of our forces for further conduct of military operations.While departing, Minister Pak Heon-yeong agreed with my point of view about the general situation and said that his visit had the goal of a simple meeting and his opinion is not the opinion of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party and the Korean government, but purely his personal opinion.2. In 1951 the Korean government collected agricultural taxes in kind in grain in the amount of 650,000 tons, which constituted too large a percentage of the entire yield. At the present time 10 percent of the population is suffering from hunger. The majority of the peasant population will be able to subsist only until April-May.If there is no assistance soon, then this will influence not only the carrying out of spring sowing but also the gathering of the harvest.They say that our government has already resolved to deliver to the Korean government 30,000 tons of grain. I do not know, is this true? If it is not true, I consider that it is necessary to prepare for timely delivery of 30,000 tons of grain in March for the purpose of providing assistance so that the peasants can engage in spring planting.3. I consider that although our budget is also very strained, in 1952 we nevertheless need to plan to apportion 1,600,000 million yuan (which constitutes approximately 237 million rubles) according to the plan of 1951 budget year for rendering aid to Korea. This amount can hardly be reduced. I ask that all this possibly be planned earlier in the general budget.\"My answer of 4.2 of this year.\"I received your telegram of 22.1 of this year. As concerns rendering aid to Korea, in our budget for 1952 we have already included expenditures of 1,500,000 million yuan (approximately equal to 222 million rubles), which somewhat exceeds the sum of the trade credit extended by China to Korea in 1951, the sum granted by China for urgent restoration of Korean railroads and also the sum granted by China for maintenance of Korean citizens located in Manchuria.If military operations in Korea are ended, then it is assumed that expenditures for aid to Korea will be increased.At the end of January of this year the Minister of Trade of Korea Comrade Jang Si-woo [Jang Si U] came to Beijing for negotiations about deliveries of goods in 1952. As a result of these negotiations the total value we established for goods delivered by us comes to 700,000 million yuan (approximately 103 million rubles).Korea will not deliver anything to us in exchange, and therefore the aforementioned amount was established as the sum of trade credit.As concerns foodstuffs stipulated in the application, the delivery according to this application will be carried out from February to May. In each month 5,000 tons of rice and 5,000 tons of foxtail millet [Setaria italica] (in all 40,000 tons of rice and foxtail millet will be delivered), in each month 200 tons of bean oil.In addition, in February 3,300,000 meters of cotton fabric will be delivered.Negotiations will be concluded soon. According to your practical observation, if military operations in Korea cease, what is necessary to restore in Korea as first priority?The army of the Chinese volunteers can render assistance as a work force to restore the highways and agricultural economy. What other kind of aid is needed from us?I ask you to study these questions and communicate your opinion.\"MAO ZEDONGNo. 4318.2.52[…] \n",

      "[....]21 February 1952Comrade Filippov!Over the span of twenty days, starting from 28 January to 17 February 1952, the enemy on 8 occasions used aircraft and art[illery] shells to drop three kinds of insects—black flies, fleas, and lice—on the positions of our troops in the central sector of the Korean Front around the Isen-Heiko-Sakunei Triangle, and also intermittently in the eastern sector of the front.Currently, these three types of insects are found in the fields, on the highways, in the forests and meadows, and on the banks of streams in the areas mentioned above, with the greatest density in some places reaching 10-15 insects per square meter.Initial analysis of the insects brought from the front has shown that these insects are bacilli carriers of cholera and the plague.According to reports received from the front, there have already been cases of people becoming ill and infected with cholera, typhus, typhoid fever, and encephalitis. Two of those who became ill have died.Currently an investigation is being carried out and the reasons for their deaths are being clarified. Thus far, it has not been conclusively determined whether they were infected by the bacillus carriers mentioned above.To meet the urgent needs of the front, we have already sent sanitation squads to combat these diseases and by air have delivered to the front some 3.4 million doses of vaccine against plague and cholera, as well as 4,000 pounds of powder to kill insects.Secret information and press reports obtained by us confirm that the American imperialists in Korea have systematically and deliberately disseminated the bacilli carriers.Three of the five prominent Japanese war criminals involved in bacteriological warfare who were mentioned in the Soviet Government’s note of 1 February 1950 — namely, Ishii Shiro, Wakamatsu Yujiro and Kitano Masajo— are currently in Korea. They took with them all the equipment necessary to conduct bacteriological warfare, including bacilli carriers of cholera and plague as well as gases that act to destroy human blood, and also a variety of equipment to disseminate the bacilli carriers.Under the auspices of the Americans, Japanese war criminals with knowledge of bacteriological warfare are using Chinese and Korean prisoners of war for testing of bacteriological weapons. These war criminals compiled a report on how bacteriological weapons are being used during military operations in winter conditions.In March 1951 the chief of department of medical welfare under the General Staff of the UN forces, Brigadier-General [Crawford] Sams arrived at the port Genzan on Bacterio-Assault Landing Craft No. 1091, and then he visited Kyoseyto Island, where bacteriological weapons were tested on Chinese and Korean prisoners of war under his guidance and supervision. This was reported on 18 May 18, 1951 by an American correspondent for the Associated Press agency who visited Kyoseyto Island. On this occasion the enemy's actions aimed at disseminating bacilli carriers were similar to the actions and methods used by war criminals with knowledge of bacteriological warfare Ishii Shiro as well as other Japanese war criminals responsible for bacteriological warfare during the Sino-Japanese War.On behalf of the Minister of Foreign Affairs first of [North] Korea and then of China, we intend to appeal to the whole world with a protest against the criminal actions of American imperialism, which has embarked on bacteriological warfare in Korea.  The All-China Committee of Partisans for Peace will appeal to the World Council of Partisans for Peace with a proposal to launch a campaign against the criminal actions of the American imperialists, who have embarked on bacteriological warfare in Korea.We are reporting to you about this, and we hope that the Soviet Government will provide us with effective help, and we also hope to receive your instructions about this matter.With greetings,MAO ZEDONG\n",

      "SECOND MAIN ADMINISTRATION OF THE GENERAL STAFF OF THE SOVIET ARMYCIPHERED TELEGRAMCopies: Stalin (2)From BEIJING Received 02 hours, 40 minutes8.1.1951EXTREMELY URGENT T.TO FILIPPOV [Stalin].I send you a copy of the telegram to Comrade Kim Il Sung from Comrades Peng Dehuai, Kim Son and Pak Il-u [Pak Il U], sent 24:00 4.1 [January 4].I ask you to familiarize yourself with it:“To Premier Comrade Kim Il Sung. We are simultaneously sending a copy to the commanders of the corps and army Comrades Hun Xianchu, Wu Ruilin, Chzhou Biao, Pan Khe-som and to the commander of the 1st Corps NRVS and to the staff of the Northeast.1. Today (4 January) the 116th infantry division and a unit of troops from the 117th infantry division occupied the city of Seoul. Enemy troops defending Seoul withdrew to the south bank of the Han-gang river. The city of Chuncheon was also taken on 3 January by units of our 66th army.The enemy withdrew to the area of Hongcheon and to areas further south. It is supposed that the next attempt by enemy troops will be the defense of the river, which is beginning in the area of Jemulpo [Incheon], Gimpo, Iokhei, and is going on along the south bank of the Han-gang river, through Wonju, Seikheisio to Gangneung.It is possible that the enemy, regrouping behind the natural barriers, like the Han-gang river and the mountainous areas, will gather the remnants of its forces, gain time and make preparations for new military operations.Another possibility is that, in case of further more powerful strikes by our troops, the enemy will withdraw to the south.2. If we give the enemy the possibility to continue to occupy defensive positions along the south bank of the river Han-gang, to control the airport at Gimpo and to use the port at Jemulpo [Incheon] for supply, then although Seoul will be in our hands, it will be under constant threat from enemy air force and artillery, which will be extremely disadvantageous for preparing our troops for a spring offensive.If, in the presence of success, our troops make one more effort and destroy another unit of enemy troops and force the enemy to retreat from the south bank of the Han-gang river, then we not only will be able to take the Gimpo airport and control the port of Jemulpo [Incheon], but this will create more advantageous conditions for the preparation of our troops for a spring offensive.In order to achieve the aforementioned goals the following plan has been worked out:a) To leave 1 division of 1st corps of the People's Army for garrison duty in the city of Seoul.The main forces of the corps will be deployed in the area of Toto, Tok-heiri, Dzinsori, Mokudo.After rest and regrouping, in three days they must prepare to make a forced crossing of the Han-gang river and at the appropriate moment occupy the Gimpo airport, Jemulpo [Incheon] port and consolidate themselves there.b) Troops of the left column as before are under the unified command of Khan' Sian'-chu.The 50th army will continue to advance in the direction of Kosainairi, Kando, Kiriudo and the area to the northwest of these points. It will send out immediately a strong detachment to control the bridge across the Han-gang river (by a counterattack attempt to occupy the fortification before the bridge on the south bank of the Han-gang river). This detachment will find out what the situation is, make active preparations for a forced crossing of the Han-gang river, attack the enemy on the south bank and continue to carry out the battle in cooperation with the main forces. If the enemy continues to withdraw to the south, then it is necessary, while pursuing him, to occupy Suwon and to wait for further orders.The line of delimitation between the 50th army and the 1st corps of the People's Army runs through Kokusekiri, Yongsan, Kasaivairi. The line itself and the areas to the west of it belong to the 50th army, the areas to the east of this line belong to the 1st corps. The 38th, 39th and 40th armies will put themselves in order, rest for three days (until 7.1 inclusive) and prepare for a forced crossing of the Khokukan-ko river above and below Songcheon. They will first strike the enemy in the area of Iuokhei, after which they will develop an offensive along a line from the southeast to the northwest on the enemy positions in the area of Icheon, Kosiu, Suien, Yeongdeok.A detailed plan is being worked out by Comrade Hun Xianchu.c) The 42nd and 66th armies under the unified command of Wu Ruilin and Chzhou Biao, and also the 2nd and 5th corps of the People's Army under the unified command of Pan Kho-Son, in accordance with the joint forces plan established earlier, must destroy the enemy troops in the region of Hongcheon, Odzio, and afterwards await further orders.All the aforementioned troops must send spies and outposts toward the enemy troops located in front of the frontline.When the troops of the right column begin a new offensive these units must be ready to render assistance. Peng Dehuai, Kim Son, Pak Il-u. 24:00 4.1.”With Bolshevik greetings.MAO ZEDONG.No. 1037.1.51.\n",

FILIPPOV [Stalin]I am sending you for [your] information the text of an agreement reached about two orders of business.\"Point two of the agenda: 'The establishment of a military demarcation line between the two sides in order to establish a demilitarized zone as the main condition for a cessation of hostilities in Korea' (agreed on 23 November 1951).1. The principle has been adopted that the actual line of contact between the sides will become (by what is described in point two or three of this agreement, depending on how circumstances require it) the military demarcation line and at a time indicated which will be indicated in the signed armistice agreement; the armed forces of both sides will withdraw two kilometers from this line in order to establish a demilitarized zone during the armistice period.2. The subcommittee of representatives of both sides should determine the current line of contact as a military demarcation line and the midline of the demilitarized zone in accordance with the above principle. No corrections should be made to this military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone regardless of any changes in the actual lineof contact on condition that the military armistice agreement is signed within 30 days after the plenary meeting of the delegations approve this agreement and the exact location of the military demarcation line and demilitarized zone mentioned above.3. In view of the fact that hostilities will continue until an armistice agreement is signed, in the event that the military armistice agreement is not signed within 30 days after plenary meeting of the delegations approves this agreement and the exact location of the military demarcation line and demilitarized zone as mentioned in point 2 of this agreement, before the signing of a military armistice the subcommittee of representatives of both sides should immediately make corrections in this military demarcation line and demilitarized zone in accordance with the actual line of contact so that the corrected military demarcation line between the two sides which exists at that moment will become the military demarcation line during the military armistice['].Point 3 of the agenda: 'Working out practical measures to implement a ceasefire and an armistice in Korea, including the composition, authority, and functions of the staff to observe the implementation of the ceasefire and armistice conditions' (agreed to 12-29 October 1951).1. All armed forces under the control of each side, including regular and irregular units and also the armed personnel of ground, naval, and air forces, should cease all hostilities within 24 hours after the signing of the armistice agreement.2. All armed forces under the control of each side should be withdrawn from the demilitarized zone within 72 hours after the armistice agreement is signed and goes into effect.No armed forces of either side, with the exception of those armed forces of a police nature regarding which both sides will come to a special agreement between themselves, should enter the demilitarized zone from this time; no armed forces of either side should commit any acts of armed violence toward the demilitarized zone.Each side should conduct administrative affairs in that part of the demilitarized zone which is on its side of the demarcation line in accordance with the conditions of the armistice agreement.3. All the armed forces - land, naval, and air - under the control of each side should be withdrawn from rear and coastal islands and the waters of the other side within five days after the armistice agreement is signed and goes into effect. (There will be a special agreement about islands previously under the control of the other side and all other islands).If these armed forces are not withdrawn within the time indicated and there is no mutually agreed and valid reason for the delay of their withdrawal, the other side shall have the right to take any action against armed personnel which it deems necessary for the maintenance of security and order.4. In order to ensure the stability of the military armistice in order to facilitate the attainment of a peaceful settlement through the holding by both sides of a political conference by higher level representatives, both sides are obligated not to deliver to Korea any military personnel, combat aircraft, armored vehicles, tanks, weapons, or ammunition after the armistice agreement is signed and goes into effect.Any rotation of military personnel on a mutually agreed scale should be reported to the military ceasefire commission in order that upon authorization the neutral nations supervisory body can perform its mission to conduct on-site supervision and inspection of the rotation at mutually agreed points of debarkation in the rear.5. Both sides should appoint an equal number of members for the creation of a military armistice commission which will bear responsibility for observing the implementation of the ceasefire agreement and the settlement of any violations of the ceasefire agreement through negotiations. As stipulated in the agreement, the functions of supervision and inspection should be carried out in accordance with the two provisions below:a) the military armistice commission, which will operate through joint teams sent directly by it, should bear responsibility in the demilitarized zone itself;b) outside the demilitarized zone upon authorization a supervisory body consisting of representative of neutral countries should bear responsibility where violations of the armistice agreement occur at mutually agreed points of debarkation in the rear and on the spot.Direct inspection should be done by a supervisory body consisting of representative of neutral countries every time both sides or one of the sides of the military armistice commission addresses a request to it to investigate a violation of the armistice agreement.6. Both sides agree to address a request to neutral nations who are not participating in the Korean war and which might be acceptable to both sides to send an equal number of representatives to create a supervisory body with their agreement. This supervisory body authorized by the military armistice commission should bear responsibility for performing the functions of supervision and inspection as stipulated in point 4 and in paragraph \"b\" of point 5; every time both sides or one of the sides of the military armistice commission requests such an investigation the supervisory body consisting of representatives of neutral nations should immediately send inspection teams to mutually agreed debarkation points in the rear or at locations outside the demilitarized zone where the violation of the armistice agreement occurs, should perform the functions of supervision and inspection as stipulated in the armistice agreement, and report the results of such supervision and inspection to the military armistice commission.Both sides should give inspection teams consisting of representatives of neutral nations everything necessary to perform the above functions on the main lines of communications, regarding which agreement will be reached by both sides.'\"MAO ZEDONGNº 32531 January---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Deciphered by Prokop'yev 1835 31 JanuaryPrinted by Kornyushina1940 31 January Nº 491Six copies printed.

      "SECOND MAIN ADMINISTRATION OF THE GENERAL STAFF OF THE SOVIET ARMYCIPHERED TELEGRAM No. 16008Copies: Stalin (2), Molotov, Malenkov, Beria, BulganinFrom BEIJING Received 23:00 31.1.1951Series \"G\" TTo Comrade FILIPPOV [Stalin]For the past period of time, in view of the deliberate prolongation of the negotiations by the enemy in the course of the negotiations for an armistice in Korea, up to the present time a final agreement has not been achieved.However, on the basic questions of the cessation of military operations, for example: on the question \"Establishment of a military demarcation line between the two sides for the purpose of establishment of a demilitarized zone\" an agreement has already been reached on three points.On the question \"working out practical measures for the implementation of a ceasefire and armistice in Korea, including the personnel, powers and functions of the apparatus for monitoring the implementation of the conditions of the ceasefire and armistice\" an agreement has already been reached on six points (the texts are attached).However, on the questions \"Measures about prisoners of war\" the enemy in principle cannot oppose the liberation of all prisoners of war. As a consequence of this, the negotiations cannot be dragged out for a long time. Nevertheless, the enemy is trying to drag out the negotiations under the pretext of a rash demand about limiting the rebuilding and construction of airports after the cessation of military operations and also a demand about liberation of prisoners on a voluntary basis. However, in view of the fact that our side decisively opposes these proposals and also in view of the fact that it is very difficult for the enemy to mobilize public opinion for continuation of the war in Korea, the satellites of the enemy and the USA itself are trying to bring an end to the war in Korea, therefore in recent days the enemy was forced to set aside the discussion of the question of limiting restoration and construction of airports in Korea and moved to discussion of small questions concerning the agreement.According to the concrete conditions of the text of the agreement on an armistice proposed by the enemy, it is obvious that, as before, this text is not final, in other words that, as before, the enemy has included conditions about limiting the restoration and construction of airports and about liberation of prisoners of war on a voluntary basis, after having declared that these conditions can be omitted and it is possible not to discuss them. From this it is obvious that the possibility of reaching a final agreement is increasing. Of course, we never have and are not now counting only on these possibilities.We simultaneously will vigilantly follow the tricks of the ruling circles of the USA who in view of the growth of internal and external opposition will carry out as before a policy of prolonging and even of breaking down the negotiations in order to strain the international situation even more. However we are prepared in military and in political relations to inflict decisive blows on the enemy in order to shatter its plans. At the present time both sides in the negotiations have already moved over to detailed discussion of the questions.For the purposes of achieving a final agreement on an armistice it is necessary to receive your concrete instructions on the following questions:1. About the monitoring organ composed of representatives of neutral states.The American side proposes that both sides each invite three states whose armed forces are not participating in the military operations in Korea, and also that each invited state name one senior officer as a representative (in all 6 persons from the neutral states of both sides) for the creation of a monitoring organ of neutral states.We intend to agree with this arrangement and ask the Soviet Union, Poland and Czechoslovakia to send representatives so that they could discuss the matter on an equal basis with representatives of the three states invited by the USA and also have the right to veto.2. Each of the abovementioned neutral states must name one deputy representative who could participate in the meetings of the monitoring organ in the name of its representative. All representatives can take with them assistants-advisers from among the citizens of their country. All invited neutral states will provide the necessary number of administrative workers for the creation of a secretariat responsible for keeping protocols, transmitting documents and translations.3. The functions of the monitoring organ of neutral states are:a) Practical control and monitoring of the observation of the agreement by both sides--not to transport to Korea from abroad, through mutually agreed upon points, shipments to the rear as reinforcements, military personnel, combat aircraft, armored vehicles, tanks, arms and ammunition after the armistice agreement is signed and goes into force, and also to carry out an exchange of military personnel of both sides on the scale stipulated by the agreement and in identical numbers;b) Report about places where an incident occurs, about the guilt of anyone from the [two] sides outside the demilitarization zone who violates the agreement on armistice, and also the carrying out of practical observation.At the request of both sides or one side of the commission on military armistice, the monitoring organ must immediately send a neutral group for inspection and observation and also for bringing the results of the investigation to the commission on military armistice.4. Simultaneously with the establishment of the functions indicated in column \"A\" point 3, the American side also proposes that both sides after cessation of military operations must present information about precise places of deployment of the land, sea and air units which are participating in the military operations in Korea, and also must not change the deployment or carry out a concentration of their troops. We intend not to agree with this, since it was not stipulated in the points on which agreement was reached.5. As concerns the points of disembarkation in the rear where observation must be established, the American side proposes to establish in South Korea Seoul, Chemulpo [Inchon], Dzioio, Gensiu, Tsiusiu, Taiden, Anto, Dzensiu, Gunzan, Taiko, Dzenten, Pusan--in all 12 points. In North Korea to establish Singisiu, Manpkhodin, Kangge, Khesandun, Khekido, Sengdzii, Kaisiu--in all 15 points.At each point a region of operation for the neutral state must be established within a radius of 30 miles from the center of the point.We consider that the enemy has proposed too many points, the area of operation is too broad, and the number of open points is not equal. We intend to agree that both sides open 3-5 points each in North Korea: Singisiu, Seisin, Khanko, Manpkhodin and one airport. In South Korea: Pusan, Chemulpo, Suigei, Reisui, Khokodo. We also intend to propose that the radius of operations of the neutral group be established as 5 kilometers from the center of the point.6. Neutral groups of observers will be attached to the monitoring organ of neutral states. The group must be organized as a minimum from four mid-level officers (lieutenant-major), two officers each from the representatives of neutral states invited by each side. In case of necessity subgroups can be created attached to the monitor groups, composed of two representatives, one person from each side.The American side proposes to create 40 neutral groups of observers. We consider that this is too many. If an agreement is reached that both sides will each open 5 of their rear points, then it will be sufficient for fulfilling the obligations of the monitoring organ to have 16 neutral groups of observers, of which 10 groups will be permanently located at mutually agreed upon points of disembarkation and 6 groups can be used as reserves to send to the site of incidents.7. The monitoring organ of neutral groups and the commission on the military armistice must be located in one place. The neutral groups of observation during the fulfillment of the tasks of inspection and observation do not have the right to study the \"construction and characteristics\" of all types of arms and ammunition.As concerns the reports about results of the work of the neutral groups of observation, we consider that official reports must be adopted by the majority of the members of the given group, but reports not adopted by the majority of members or reports from individual persons cannot be official documents. They can be used as reference materials.8. Material supply of the monitoring organ of neutral states and the groups subordinate to it must be provided by both warring sides. Both sides must provide the monitoring organ with transport for trips of its members to points and to places where a violation of the agreement on armistice occurs.All the 8 points set forth above concern questions of monitoring by neutral states in the rear regions of both sides outside the demilitarized zone.I ask you to review whether our point of view is correct and whether anything needs to be added.If you agree with our opinions, then do you consider it necessary to communicate about this in advance to the comrade leaders of the parties of Poland and Czechoslovakia[?]I ask you to give your answer.Note: The texts of the agreement reached on two agendas was sent to you by separate telegram.With greetings.MAO ZEDONGNo. 32631.1.52[...]\n",

Land, sea and air forces of both sides, after the issuing of the order on a ceasefire, must within all the borders of Korea cease fire and halt all other hostile actions.\"This point will possibly be accepted by the enemy without qualifications.2. \"Land, sea and air forces of both sides must withdraw from the 38th parallel for a distance of 10 English miles and create a buffer zone in the region 10 English miles to the south and to the north of the 38th parallel. The civil administration of the buffer zone must be as it was before 25.6.1950, in other words to the north of the 38th parallel under the jurisdiction of the Korean People's government and to the south of the 38th parallel under the jurisdiction of the South-Korean government.\"It is possible that there will be some divergences [from this proposal] among the enemy but we consider that our proposal is extremely just and it will be difficult for the enemy to refute it.3. \"Both sides must cease the transport of arms, troops and reinforcements (including land, sea and air transport) into Korea from outside the country and also the aforementioned transports to the front line on the territory of Korea.\"We think that the enemy for his part will also advance a proposal on this question, and we therefore intend to take the initiative in this. But perhaps it is better to leave off the last part of our proposal?4. \"To create a control committee of neutral states which would supervise the fulfillment of points 1, 2 and 3. In this committee there must be an equal number of representatives of neutral states that have not taken part in the Korean war and that have been selected by both sides.\"We think that the enemy also will advance an analogous proposal, therefore we intend to show initiative in this. However, there will be numerous difficulties in the fulfillment of this point.\"Members\" of the control committee proposed by the enemy will monitor our military transport on the Chinese-Korean border and at important communications points in Korea. Or should we not take the initiative ourselves, but wait for the enemy to advance his proposal, after which we will accept it?I ask you to communicate your opinion about how to proceed expediently. To completely refuse to create a control committee seems also inadvisable. 5. \"Both sides must carry out repatriation of prisoners of war. In the course of four months after the cessation of military operations to conduct a full mutual exchange of them, in separate batches.\"The enemy will possibly propose to conduct a one for one exchange. We must demand repatriation of all prisoners of war. However, the enemy has taken prisoner a relatively larger number of North Koreans, who have already been included in the ranks of the South Korean troops, and therefore this situation will possibly elicit an argument.In our opinion the 5 basic points indicated above must be accepted at the meeting of military representatives of both sides.In addition there are some other points:1. \"All foreign troops including Chinese volunteer troops must completely leave North and South Korea within a specified period of time (for example within three-four months), in separate batches.This is also a very important point. However, the representatives of the enemy possibly will think that this question belongs among political questions and should not be resolved at this meeting.I ask you to study and communicate whether our side should advance this point.2. \"Within a specified period of time (for example in several months) refugees of North and South Korea must be returned to the areas where they lived previously.\"Comrade KIM IL SUNG insists on advancing this point. However, to bring this about is very difficult. It is apparent that with regard to this question many differences of opinion and many arguments will arise between the representatives of North and South Korea, which can have an influence on the resolution of other important questions.Or is it possible to advance this proposal?If it leads to arguments and is not resolved, then transfer it for discussion at an international conference of a political character.I ask you to communicate your opinion on the points indicated above. Furthermore, yesterday we sent Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Comrade Li Kenong and his assistant to Korea. He will arrive approximately on 5.7.1951 and will discuss with Comrade KIM IL SUNG and other comrades various questions concerning the peace negotiations.After this he will go to the area of Kaesong, whence he will secretly lead the negotiations.I am also sending you the telegram which lays out the opinion of Comrade KIM IL SUNG on this question.MAO ZEDONGNo. 33053.7.51###\n",

To heighten vigilance up to the limit.

They explained this by the fact that foreign troops were sent by various countries and therefore this issue can only be discussed with the consent of the governments of the various countries and the UN. They repeatedly asked questions about this point.Finally, the enemy representatives moved to minor issues (for example, freedom of communications) in order to stall for time and not reveal their platform.They took the draft of our agenda with them for discussion.

Everyone undoubtedly knows this. Until achievement of an agreement by both sides about the conditions for a cessation of military operations hostilities may continue as before in all areas except the neutral zone created by agreement of both sides. The delegation of UN headquarters forces is ready to exert its efforts to realize a cessation of hostilities and of the creation of military conditions which ensure the resumption of hostilities. Our delegation came here just to achieve this common goal. The delegation will only discuss military issues of Korea alone. Our delegation will not discuss any political or economic issues and will also not discuss military issues unrelated to Korea.The success and failure of the negotiations which have begun today will depend on the realistic intentions of those delegations present here. If both sides have sincere intentions an atmosphere of mutual understanding can be created. If there is such an atmosphere we have good reason to hope for success. There is such an atmosphere where truth prevails.As head of the UN forces delegation and as the immediate representative of the Commander-in-Chief of the UN forces I want to clearly state that the UN delegation has the most sincere intentions so that every person have this in mind if he is not intent on consciously creating misunderstanding.We think that the representatives of the Korean and Chinese armies will act in the same way.

Filippov!I am sending you brief report Nº 3 received from Cde. Li Kenong for your information. \"To Cde. Mao Zedong. Copy to Cde. Kim Il Sung.I submit brief report Nº 3 about the progress of the conference.Minor issues were resolved first at today's meeting of the conference (the issue of communications) but as before the fight was mainly waged about the issues of the 38th parallel and the withdrawal of troops from Korea.Below I cite an abbreviated transcript of the statement of Joy, the head of the American delegation. In his statement at 1100 11 July 1951 Joy said:\"I want to dwell on the criticism to which your side subjected the agenda we proposed. The Communist representatives stated that our second point of the agenda does not correspond to the formulation of the issue at this conference. This issue is about the right of the International Red Cross to visit POW camps. Putting off the resolution of this issue for one day can increase the unnecessary suffering of the prisoners by a great deal. The activity of the Red Cross covers all prisoners and is done in the interests of all prisoners regardless of their citizenship. This organization's aid to prisoners is based on the principles of humanity and is not of a military nature. The mutual exchange of prisoners is a military issue, but the work of the Red Cross contains nothing military.In July 1950 the North Korean government declared that it wanted to implement the principles of the Geneva Convention about prisoners into effect. One of the principles of the Convention says that the representatives of the International Red Cross are permitted to visit POW camps. The Korean government should have implemented this principle long ago, however it has not done this.As regards the statement that your delegation considers it unnecessary to include the third point in the agenda which we proposed about limiting discussion to just purely military issues regarding Korea, our delegation proposes to include this point in the agenda and thereby limit a review of the issues at the conference in order not to lose sight of or go beyond the limits of the discussion of the issues which require resolution. Therefore no one should oppose inclusion of this point in the agenda.Your representatives think that the fourth and fifth points we proposed are superficial. The nature and the wording of the agenda we proposed is general because we think that the work will thus promote an expedient pace for the conference.Special attention ought to be devoted to the fourth point of the agenda we proposed. In offering the point about ceasing hostile and armed actions it is necessary to ensure conditions in which hostile or armed actions cannot be resumed. Such a guarantee is needed. Of course, this point will contain a great many issues which are impossible to give in detail and therefore we are providing a general wording.As regards the fifth point, we already explained it at yesterday's meeting and are giving a more detailed explanation right now.The UN delegation thinks that both sides should first of all agree on general issues without getting into details and only then discuss them in detail during the formulation of general issues.For example, among such issues is the issue of forming a buffer zone. You propose creating a definite boundary and a definite buffer zone. We think that it is first of all necessary to decide about the common desire of both sides to create a boundary and a buffer zone and the possibility of agreeing on this issue. Then, after obtaining the agreement of both sides, [we] can move to the discussion of the issue of creating a boundary and a buffer zone and thereby achieve agreement.We should not seek details in the agenda. Thus a decision about exactly where there should be a buffer zone should be made during the next discussion. Such an agenda does not obligate either of the sides to confine itself to its details.We know that both sides have agreed to create a buffer zone and therefore this issue should be in the agenda as one of the general issues.Although according to the agenda a definite decision about a buffer zone might be achieved in subsequent meetings it is however necessary to understand that the delegation of UN forces headquarters has no interest in an arbitrary boundary passing from east to west which has no military significance, does not offer any guarantee, and has no relation to the military situation in Korea (Our representatives asked the enemy representative to repeat this phrase in English).As regards the sixth point proposed by our delegation, your side said that this issue is not at all important.In our view, if a plenipotentiary commission concerning a cessation of hostilities is not created with an equal number of participants from both sides, then it is impossible to ensure that there will not be a resumption of hostilities and it will also be impossible to guarantee the observance of the armistice conditions.As regards the seventh point of the agenda our delegation proposed, namely the military observer groups, these groups with an equal number of participants from both sides will be the eyes and ears of the ceasefire commission. The very important work of the ceasefire commission cannot be performed without observation. The armistice conditions will also be impossible to perform.As regards the eighth point of the agenda we proposed this point implies a discussion of the organization of military observation groups, their authority, the facilities they observe, and to whom they submit reports. Without a discussion of these issues and without making corresponding decisions about them a delay in work might result and misunderstandings are also possible.We think that these issues cannot be viewed as secondary and excluded from the agenda. As regards your point about the withdrawal of foreign troops we think that this issue should be resolved at higher government levels, for it goes beyond the bounds of the range of issues which ought to be discussed at this conference.The representatives of UN forces headquarters oppose the inclusion of this point in the agenda because we are not authorized to discuss this issue. Our authority has been received only from the UN forces command.As regards the second point proposed by your delegation we are prepared to accept it. The creation of a buffer zone is necessary. However, we think that we came here for talks about a ceasefire in a military sense. In our understanding a cessation of hostilities means an agreement by both sides to cease hostilities on certain conditions. Such an agreement about a cessation of hostilities between military leaders does not at all affect an agreement which might be reached by governments about political or territorial issues. Therefore the commander-in-chief of the UN forces is not interested in any arbitrary line on a map which has no military significance for the current situation.It is not in our interest to hold talks on military issues about an arbitrary line which has no relation to either tactics or the current military situation, nor also the ground relief\".(Having said this, Joy continued: \"We only agree to include your points in the agenda\". When the head of our delegation demanded the last phrase be repeated, Joy immediately declared that he was taking his words back).Nam Il asked:1. I do not understand at all what relation there is between a visit to prisoners by Red Cross representatives and the issue of the cessation of hostilities. Please explain what is better for the prisoners, a visit to them by Red Cross representatives or the quickest possible return home?2. As regards the third point you proposed which provides for the discussion of issues relating only to Korea, what other issues besides Korean ones might be discussed at this conference?3. I do not understand at all what you mean by enemy when speaking of hostile and armed acts mentioned in the fourth point of your agenda.4. Analyzing your fifth point, you said that it is impossible to achieve a ceasefire without provisions ensuring that hostilities and armed actions would not resume. What does this mean? We want to know, how a ceasefire can be ensured without a withdrawal of foreign troops?5. What is a ceasefire commission and observer group? Without a clarification of these concepts there will be difficulties when discussing the agenda (Soon afterwards a one hour 35-minute break was announced until 1300).Joy said, \"I want right now to reply to the questions asked by the head of your delegation this morning. You ask, is a return home better for the prisoners or a visit by Red Cross representatives. You think it is impossible to do this simultaneously. That is wrong. Our delegation supports the proposal that Red Cross representatives visit prisoners, but also that prisoners return home. If you agree, then Red Cross representatives can visit them beginning tomorrow and while the prisoners await repatriation.On 13 July 1950 in a telegram addressed to the UN Secretary [General] the North Korean government expressed readiness to implement the principles of the Geneva Convention. One of these principles is permission for Red Cross representatives to visit prisoners. We do not understand why you disagree [protivorechite] with these decisions and principles of humanity.You ask for an explanation of what hostilities and armed actions mean. In our understanding a cessation of hostilities means a ceasefire in Korea in all forms, a ceasefire means a halt to an increase in the strength of armed units (including their plans, relocation, rearmament, and replacement) and of the threat of armed attack\".Nam Il interrupted Joy, saying, \"It seems to me that you did not correctly understand the question I raised. We understand very well what a cessation of hostilities and a ceasefire mean. I am interested in what you have in mind by measures and conditions to ensure that the hostilities you mentioned in your statement are not resumed\".Joy said, \"I will respond to that question later. An agreement alone about a cessation of hostilities being put into effect on the basis of conditions agreed to by both sides will possibly allow both sides to increase their strength during an armistice. Therefore if only ceasefire measures are carried out and there are no provisions guaranteeing the hostilities will not be resumed then the hostilities which resume after an armistice might be more severe.You ask what might guarantee that hostilities do not resume in the event that foreign troops are not withdrawn from Korea.We think that this guarantee consists of the following:1. In the creation of a military ceasefire commission and a corresponding number of observer groups.2. In the creation of a buffer zone.3. In the achievement of an agreement between the commanding generals of both warring sides about the ceasefire conditions (including the authority of the ceasefire commission) in order to ensure the observance of the decisions made by both sides.The ceasefire commission should be created by agreement between the commanding generals of both sides with the participation of an equal number of representatives from both sides.Within the boundaries of the established areas commission members should have the right of free movement in order to be able to monitor the implementation of the joint decisions of both sides about the ceasefire. The commission should report instances of violations of the ceasefire agreement to the headquarters of both sides at the same time as work is done to observe and provide assistance.The military observation groups are bodies attached to the ceasefire commission which observe whether real work is being done by both sides to carry out the provisions of the ceasefire agreement\".Joy said, \"I understood that you do not want to change the wording of the second point of the agenda you proposed. You do not want to attach a general meaning to it\".Nam Il asked, \"What is your opinion?Joy said, \"By general meaning I have in mind the fifth point of the agenda we proposed. This is the point about the buffer zone. You are proposing a line; in reality there are very many possible lines\".Nam Il said, \"We have already proposed our own line to you. What line can you propose?\"Joy replied, \"We are not proposing any line because essentially the issue already touches on this. As we understood, you don't want to amend the second point of the general meaning of the agenda you proposed\".Nam Il said, \"Our proposal already has a general meaning\".Joy said, \"As regards the second point of the agenda you proposed we cannot agree that the point you offered about some definite line be included in the agenda. We can agree to include the issue of the creation of a buffer zone in the agenda. The issue of the location and the boundaries of this zone should be resolved during the substance of the discussion of this issue. I again want to stress that this meeting does not pursue the goal of resolving issues, for example, regarding the issue of this definite line. Such issues ought to be discussed at subsequent meetings\".Nam Il said, \"The 38th parallel is not any imaginary line, the 38th parallel already existed. Military operations began at this very line and therefore a ceasefire agreement also should be based on the 38th parallel. Thus this point has to be included in the agenda\".Joy said, \"You have given me to understand that you are refusing to attach a general meaning to the agenda you proposed. I cannot interpret this otherwise\".  Li Kenong. 0130 12 July\".MAO ZEDONG Nº 349012 July 1951--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Deciphered by Fedyaev at 0200 13 JulyPrinted by Lavreshina at 0215 13 July Nº 1087Four copies sent.

      "After you left yesterday I could not fall asleep, nor did I have dinner. [1]  Today I invite you over to talk a bit more so that you can be [my] doctor: [after talking with you], I might be able to eat and sleep this afternoon.  You are fortunate to have little difficulty in eating and sleeping.Let us return to the main subject and chat about the issues we discussed yesterday.  We will only talk about these issues here in this room!  There exists no crisis situation between you and me.  Our relationship can be described as: nine out of ten fingers of yours and ours are quite the same with only one finger differing.  I have repeated this point two or three times.  You haven’t forgotten, have you?I’ve thought over and again of the issues that were discussed yesterday.  It is likely that I might have misunderstood you, but it is also possible that I was right.  We may work out a solution after discussion or debate.  It appears that [we] will have to withdraw [our] navy’s request for [obtaining] nuclear-powered submarines [from the Soviet Union].  Barely remembering this matter, I have acquired some information about it only after asking others.[2] There are some warmhearted people at our navy’s headquarters, namely, the Soviet advisers.  They asserted that, now that the Soviet nuclear submarines have been developed, we can obtain [them] simply by sending a cable [to Moscow]. Well, your navy’s nuclear submarines are of a [top] secret advanced technology.  The Chinese people are careless in handling things.  If we are provided with them, we might put you to trouble.The Soviet comrades have won victory for forty years, and are thus rich in experience.  It has only been eight years since our victory and we have little experience.  You therefore raised the question of joint ownership and operation.  The issue of ownership has long before been dealt with: Lenin proposed the system of rent and lease which, however, was targeted at the capitalists.China has some remnant capitalists, but the state is under the leadership of the Communist Party.  You never trust the Chinese!  You only trust the Russians!  [To you] the Russians are the first-class [people] whereas the Chinese are among the inferior who are dumb and careless.  Therefore [you] came up with the joint ownership and operation proposition.  Well, if [you] want joint ownership and operation, how about have them all—let us turn into joint ownership and operation our army, navy, air force, industry, agriculture, culture, education.  Can we do this?  Or, [you] may have all of China’s more than ten thousand kilometers of coastline and let us only maintain a guerrilla force.  With a few atomic bombs, you think you are in a position to control us through asking for the right of rent and lease.  Other than this, what else [do you have] to justify [your request]?Lüshun [Port Arthur] and Dalian [Darinse] were under your control before.  You departed from these places later.  Why [were these places] under your control?  It is because then China was under the Guomindang’s rule.  Why did you volunteer to leave? It is because the Communist Party had taken control of China.Because of Stalin’s pressure, the Northeast and Xinjiang became [a Soviet] sphere of influence, and four jointly owned and operated enterprises were established.[3]  Comrade Khrushchev later proposed to have these [settlements] eliminated, and we were grateful for that.You [Russians] have never had faith in the Chinese people, and Stalin was among the worst.  The Chinese [Communists] were regarded as Tito the Second; [the Chinese people] were considered as a backward nation.  You [Russians] have often stated that the Europeans looked down upon the Russians.  I believe that some Russians look down upon the Chinese people.At the most critical juncture [of the Chinese revolution], Stalin did not allow us to carry out our revolution and opposed our carrying out the revolution.  He made a huge mistake on this issue.  So did [Grigory Y.] Zinoviev.Neither were we pleased with [Anastas] Mikoyan.  He flaunted his seniority and treated us as if [we were] his sons.  He put on airs and looked very arrogant.  He assumed the greatest airs when he first visited Xibaipo in 1949[4] and has been like that every time he came to China.  Every time he came, he would urge me to visit Moscow.  I asked  him what for.  He would then say that there was always something for you to do there.  Nevertheless, only until later when Comrade Khrushchev proposed to hold a conference to work out a resolution [concerning the relationship among all the communist parties and socialist states] did [I go to Moscow].[5]It was our common duty to commemorate the fortieth anniversary of the October Revolution.  Up to that time, as I often pointed out, there had existed no such thing as brotherly relations among all the parties because, [your leaders] merely paid lip service and never meant it; as a result, the relations between [the brotherly] parties can be described as between father and son or between cats and mice.  I have raised this issue in my private meetings with Khrushchev and other [Soviet] comrades.  They all admitted that such a father-son relationship was not of European but Asian style.  Present were Bulganin, Mikoyan, and [M. A.] Suslov.  Were you also at the meeting?  From the Chinese side, I and Deng Xiaoping were present.I was unhappy with Mikoyan’s congratulation speech which he delivered at our Eighth National Congress and I deliberately refused to attend that day’s meeting as a protest.  You did not know that many of our deputies were not happy with [Mikoyan’s speech].  Acting as if he was the father, he regarded China as Russia’s son.China has her own revolutionary traditions, although China’s revolution could not have succeeded without the October Revolution, nor without Marxism-Leninism.We must learn from the Soviet experiences.  We will comply with the commonly accepted principles, especially the nine principles stated in the “Moscow Manifesto.”[6] We ought to learn from all the experiences whether they are correct or erroneous.  The erroneous lessons included Stalin’s metaphysics and dogmatism.  He was not totally metaphysical because he had acquired some dialectics in thinking; but a large part of his [thoughts] focused on metaphysics.  What you termed as the cult of personality was one [example of his metaphysics].  Stalin loved to assume the greatest airs.Although we support the Soviet Union, we won’t endorse its mistakes.  As for [the differences over] the issue of peaceful evolution, we have never openly discussed [these differences], nor have we published [them] in the newspapers.  Cautious as we have been, we choose to exchange different opinions internally.  I had discussed them with you before I went to Moscow.  While in Moscow, [we assigned] Deng Xiaoping to raise five [controversial] issues.  We won’t openly talk about them even in the future, because our doing so would hurt Comrade Khrushchev’s [political position].  In order to help consolidate his [Khrushchev’s] leadership, we decided not to talk about these [controversies], although it does not mean that the justice is not on our side.With regard to inter-governmental relations, we remain united and unified up to this date which even our adversaries have conceded.  We are opposed to any [act] that is harmful to the Soviet Union.  We have objected to all the major criticism that the revisionists and imperialists have massed against the Soviet Union.  The Soviet Union has so far done the same thing [for us].When did the Soviets begin to trust us Chinese?  At the time when [we] entered the Korean War.  From then on, the two countries got closer to one another [than before] and as a result, the 156 aid projects came about.  When Stalin was alive, the [Soviet] aid consisted of 141 projects.  Comrade Khrushchev later added a few more.[7]We have held no secrets from you.  Because more than one thousand of your experts are working in our country, you are fully aware of the state of our military, political, economic, and cultural affairs.  We trust your people, because you are from a socialist country, and you are sons and daughters of Lenin.Problems have existed in our relations, but it was mainly Stalin’s responsibility.  [We] have had three grievances [against Stalin].  The first concerns the two Wang Ming lines.  Wang Ming was Stalin’s follower.  The second was [Stalin’s] discouragement of and opposition to our revolution.  Even after the dissolution of the Third International, he still issued orders claiming that, if we did not strike a peace deal with Jiang Jieshi, China would risk a grave danger of national elimination.[8]  Well, for whatever reason, we are not eliminated.  The third was during my first visit to Moscow during which Stalin, [V.M.] Molotov, and [Lavrenti] Beria personally attacked me.Why did I ask Stalin to send a scholar [to China] to read my works?[9]  Was it because I so lacked confidence that I would even have to have you read my works?  Or was it because I had nothing to do myself?  Not a chance!  [My real intention] was to get you over to China to see with your own eyes whether China was truly practicing Marxism or only half-hearted toward Marxism.Upon your return [to Moscow] you spoke highly of us.  Your first comment to Stalin was “the Chinese [comrades] are truly Marxists.”  Nevertheless Stalin remained doubtful.  Only when [we entered] the Korean War did he change his view [about us], and so did East European and other brotherly parties drop their doubts [about us].It appears that there are reasons for us to be suspect: “First, you opposed Wang Ming; second, you simply insisted on carrying out your revolution regardless of [our] opposition; third, you looked so smart when you went all the way to Moscow desiring Stalin to sign an agreement so that [China] would regain authority over the [Manchurian] railroad.”  In Moscow it was [I. V.] Kovalev who took care of me with [N. T.] Fedorenko as my interpreter.[10]  I got so angry that I once pounded on the table.  I only had three tasks here [in Moscow], I said to them, the first was to eat, the second was to sleep, and the third was to shit.There was a [Soviet] adviser in [our] military academy who, in discussing war cases, would only allow [the Chinese trainees] to talk about those of the Soviet Union, not China’s, would only allow them to talk about the ten offensives of the Soviet Army, not [ours] in the Korean War.Please allow us to talk about these cases!  [Can you imagine] he wouldn’t even allow us to talk about [our own war experiences]!  For God’s sake, we fought wars for twenty-two years; we fought in Korea for three years!  Let [me ask] the Central Military Commission to prepare some materials concerning [our war experiences] and give them to Comrade Yudin, of course, if he is interested.We did not speak out on some [controversial] issues because we did not want to cause problems in the Sino-Soviet relations.  This was particularly true when the Polish Incident broke out.  When Poland demanded that all of your specialists go home, Comrade Liu Shaoqi suggested in Moscow that you withdraw some.  You accepted [Liu’s] suggestion which made the Polish people happy because they then tasted some freedom.  At that time we did not raise our problems with your specialists [in China] because, we believe, it would have caused you to be suspicious that we took the advantage [of your crisis situation] to send all the specialists home.  We will not send your specialists home; we will not do so even if Poland does so ten more times.  We need Soviet aid.Once I have persuaded the Polish people that [we all] should learn from the Soviet Union, and that after putting the anti-dogmatism campaign at rest, [they] ought to advocate a “learn from the Soviet Union” slogan.  Who will benefit in learning from the Soviet Union?  The Soviet Union or Poland?  Of course, it will benefit Poland more.Although we shall learn from the Soviet Union, we must first of all take into account our own experiences and mainly rely on our own experiences.There should be some agreed limits on the terms of [Soviet] specialists.  For instance, there have never been restrictions on your chief advisers in [our] military and public security branches, who can come and go without even notifying or consulting with us in advance.  Presumably, if you leave your post, is it all right that another ambassador be sent [to China] without discussing it with us?  No, absolutely not!  How much information could your advisers to our ministry of public security obtain if they merely sit there totally uninformed by their Chinese colleagues?Let me advise you [and your specialists] to pay more visits to each of our provinces so as to get in touch with the people and obtain first-hand information.  This have I mentioned to Comrade Yudin many times:  if not ten thousand times, at least one thousand times!With some exceptions, though, most of the [Soviet] specialists are of a good quality.  We have also made mistakes before: we did not take the initiative to pass on information to the Soviet comrades.  Now we must correct these mistakes by adopting a more active attitude [toward the Soviet comrades].  Next time [we] ought to introduce to them China’s general line.  If the first time [we] fail to get the information through, [we] will try a second time, third time, and so forth.Indeed, it was [your] proposition for establishing a “cooperative” on nuclear submarines which led to these remarks.  Now that we’ve decided not to build our nuclear submarines, we are withdrawing our request [for obtaining submarines from the Soviet Union].  Otherwise, we would have to let you have the entire coast, much larger areas than [what you used to control in] Lüshun and Dalian.  Either way, however, we will not get mixed up with you: we must be independent from one another.  Since we will in the end build our own flotilla, it is not in our interest that [we] play a minor role in this regard.Certainly [the arrangements] will be totally different in war time.  Your army can operate in our [land], and our army can move to your places to fight.  If your army operates on our territory, however, it must be commanded by us.  When our army fights in your land, as long as it does not outnumber your army, it has to be directed by you.These remarks of mine may not sound so pleasing to your ear.  You may accuse me of being an nationalist or another Tito.  My counter argument is that you have extended Russian nationalism to China’s coast.It was Comrade Khrushchev who had eliminated the four joint enterprises.  Before his death, Stalin demanded the right to build a plant to manufacture canned food in our country.  My response was that [we] would accept [the demand] as long as you provide us equipment, help us build it, and import all the products [from us].  Comrade Khrushchev praised me for giving [Stalin] a good answer.  But why in the world do [you Russians] want to build a naval “cooperative” now?  How would you explain to the rest of the world that you propose to build a naval “cooperative”? How would you explain to the Chinese people?  For the sake of struggling against the imperialists, you may, as advisers, train the Chinese people.  Otherwise, you would have to lease Lüshun and other [ports] for ninety-nine years; but your “cooperative” proposal involves the question of ownership, as you propose that each side will own fifty percent of it.  Yesterday you made me so enraged that I could not sleep at all last night.  They (pointing at other CCP leaders present) are not angry.  Only me alone!  If this is wrong, it will be my sole responsibility.(Zhou Enlai: Our Politburo has unanimously agreed upon these points.)If we fail to get our messages through this time, we may have to arrange another meeting; if not, we may have to meet every day.  Still, I can go to Moscow to speak to Comrade Khrushchev; or we can invite Comrade Khrushchev to come to Beijing so as to clarify every issue.(Peng Dehuai: This year Soviet Defense Minister Malinovsky cabled me requesting to build a long-wave radio station along China’s coast to direct the [Soviet] submarine flotilla in the Pacific Ocean.  As the project will cost a total of 110 million rubles, the Soviet Union will cover 70 million and China will pay 40 million.)This request is of the same nature as the naval “cooperative” proposal which [we] cannot explain to the people.  [We] will be put in a politically disadvantageous position if [we] reveal these requests to the world.(Peng Dehuai:  Petroshevskii [a Soviet military adviser] also has a rude attitude and rough style.  He is not very pleased because some of our principles for army building do not completely follow the Soviet military codes.  Once at an enlarged CMC meeting, when Comrade Ye Fei from the Fujian Military District[11] pointed out that, as the Soviet military codes were basically to guide operations on flatlands, and as Fujian [province] had nothing but mountains, the Soviet codes were not entirely applicable [to Fujian’s reality].  Very upset at hearing this, Petroshevskii immediately responded: “You have insulted the great military science invented by the great Stalin!”  His remarks made everyone at the meeting very nervous.)Some of the above-mentioned [controversial] issues have been raised [by us] before, some have not.  You have greatly aided us but now we are downplaying your [role]; you may feel very bad about it.  Our relationship, however, resembles that between professor and student:  the professor may make mistakes, do not you agree that the student has to point them out?  Pointing out mistakes does not mean that the [student] will drive the professor out.  After all the professor is a good one.You are assisting us to build a navy!  Your [people] can serve as advisers.  Why would you have to have fifty percent of the ownership?  This is a political issue.  We plan to build two or three hundred submarines of this kind.If you insist on attaching political conditions [to our submarine request], we will not satisfy you at all, not even give you a tiny [piece of our] finger.  You may inform Comrade Khrushchev that, if [he] still [insists on] these conditions, there is no point for us to talk about this issue.  If he accepts our requirement, he may come [to Beijing]; if not, he does not have to come, because there is nothing for us to talk about.  Even one tiny condition is unacceptable [for us]!When this issue is involved, we will refuse to accept your aid for ten thousand years.  However, it is still possible for us to cooperate on many other affairs; it is unlikely that we would break up.  We will, from beginning to the end, support the Soviet Union, although we may quarrel with each other inside the house.While I was in Moscow, I once made it clear to Comrade Khrushchev that you did not have to satisfy every one of our requests.  Because if you hold back your aid from us, [you] in effect would compel us to work harder [to be self-reliant]; should we get everything from you, we will end up in an disadvantageous position.It is, however, extremely important for us to cooperate politically.  Because, if we undermine your political positions, you will encounter considerable problems; the same is true with us: if you undermine our [political] positions, we will be in trouble.In wartime, you can utilize all our naval ports, military bases, and other [facilities].  [In return] our [military] can operate in your places including your port or bases at Vladivostok and shall return home when war is over.  We may sign an agreement on wartime cooperation in advance which does not have to wait until war breaks out.  Such an agreement must contain a stipulation that our [forces] can operate on your territory; even if we might not do so, such a stipulation is required, because it involves the issue of equality.  In peacetime, however, such an arrangement cannot be accepted.  In peacetime, you are only to help us construct [military] bases and build armed forces.We would not have accepted [your] proposition for building a naval “cooperative” even it had been during Stalin’s time.  I quarreled with him in Moscow!Comrade Khrushchev has established his credibility by having the [previous] “cooperative” projects eliminated.  Now that such an issue involving ownership is raised again, we are reminded of Stalin’s positions.  I might be mistaken, but I must express my opinion.You explained [to me] yesterday that [your proposition] was based on the consideration that [Russia’s coastal] conditions were not as good for nuclear submarines to function fully as China’s, thus hamstringing future development of nuclear submarines.  You can reach [the Pacific] Ocean from Vladivostok through the Kurile Islands.  The condition is very good!What you said [yesterday] made me very uneasy and displeased.  Please report all my comments to Comrade Khrushchev: you must tell him exactly what I have said without any polishing so as to make him uneasy.  He has criticized Stalin’s [policy] lines but now adopts the same policies as Stalin did.We will still have controversies.  You do not endorse some of our positions; we cannot accept some of your policies.  For instance, your [leadership] is not pleased at our policy regarding “internal contradictions among the people,” and the policy of “letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend.”Stalin endorsed the Wang Ming line, causing the losses of our revolutionary strength up to more than ninety percent.  At the critical junctures [of our revolution], he wanted to hold us back and opposed our revolution.  Even after [we] achieved victory, he remained doubtful about us.  At the same time, he boasted that it was because of the direction of his theories that China’s [revolution] succeeded.  [We] must do away with any superstition about him.  Before I die, I am prepared to write an article on what Stalin had done to China, which is to be published in one thousand years.(Yudin: The Soviet central leadership’s attitude toward the policies of the Chinese central leadership is:  it is completely up to the Chinese comrades how to resolve the Chinese problems, because it is the Chinese comrades who understand the situation best.  Moreover, we maintain that it is hasty and arrogant to judge and assess whether or not the CCP’s policies are correct, for the CCP is a great party.)Well, [we] can only say that we have been basically correct.  I myself have committed errors before.  Because of my mistakes, [we] had suffered setbacks, of which examples included Changsha, Tucheng, and two other campaigns.[12]  I will be very content if I am refuted as being basically correct, because such an assessment is close to reality.Whether a [joint] submarine flotilla will be built is a policy issue: only China is in a position to decide whether we should build it with your assistance or it should be “jointly owned.”  Comrade Khrushchev ought to come to China [to discuss this issue] because I have already visited him [in Moscow].[We] should by no means have blind faith in [authorities].  For instance, one of your specialists asserted on the basis of a book written by one [of your] academy scholars that our coal from Shanxi [province] cannot be turned into coke.  Well, such an assertion has despaired us: we therefore would have no coal which can be turned into coke, for Shanxi has the largest coal deposit!Comrade Xining [transliteration], a Soviet specialist who helped us build the Yangtze River Bridge [in Wuhan], is a very good comrade.  His bridge-building method has never been utilized in your country: [you] never allowed him to try his method, either to build a big or medium or even small sized bridge.  When he came here, however, his explanation of his method sounded all right.  Since we knew little about it, [we] let him try his method!  As a result, his trial achieved a remarkable success which has become a first-rate, world-class scientific invention.I have never met with Comrade Xining, but I have talked to many cadres who participated in the construction of the Yangtze Bridge.  They all told me that Comrade Xining was a very good comrade because he took part in every part of the work, adopted a very pleasant working style, and worked very closely with the Chinese comrades.  When the bridge was built, the Chinese comrades had learned a great deal [from him].  Any of you who knows him personally please convey my regards to him.Please do not create any tensions among the specialists regarding the relations between our two parties and two countries.  I never advocate that.  Our cooperation has covered a large ground and is by far very satisfactory.  You ought to make this point clear to your embassy staff members and your experts so that they will not panic when they hear that Comrade Mao Zedong criticized [Soviet leaders].  I have long before wanted to talk about some of these issues.  However, it has not been appropriate to talk about them because the incidents in Poland and Hungary put your [leadership] in political trouble.  For instance, we then did not feel it right to talk about the problem concerning the experts [in China].Even Stalin did improve himself:  he let China and the Soviet Union sign the [alliance] treaty, supported [us] during the Korean War, and provided [us] with a total of 141 aid projects.  Certainly these achievements did not belong to him but to the entire Soviet central leadership.  Nevertheless, we do not want to exaggerate Stalin’s mistakes.[1] Mao Zedong held this conversation with Yudin in the context of the emerging dispute between Beijing and Moscow on establishing a Chinese-Soviet joint submarine flotilla. Allegedly, in 1957-1958, Soviet military and naval advisors in China repeatedly made suggestions to the Chinese that they should purchase new naval equipment from the Soviet Union. On 28 June 1958, Zhou Enlai wrote to Khrushchev, requesting that the Soviet Union provide technological assistance for China’s naval buildup, especially the designs for new-type submarines. On 21 July 1958, Yudin called on Mao Zedong. Invoking Khrushchev’s name, Yudin told Mao that the geography of the Soviet Union made it difficult for it to take full advantage of the new-type submarines. Because China had a long coastline and good natural harbors, the Soviets proposed that China and the Soviet Union establish a joint submarine flotilla. Mao Zedong made the following response: “First, we should make clear the guiding principle.[Do you mean that] we should create [the flotilla] with your assistance? Or [do you mean] that we should jointly create [the flotilla], otherwise you will not offer any assistance?” Mao emphasized that he was not interested in creating a Sino-Soviet “military cooperative.” (Source:  Han Nianlong et al. Dangdai zhongguo waijiao, 113-114.) The next day, Mao discussed the proposal with Yudin at length.[2] Mao referred to Zhou Enlai and Peng Dehuai who were present during this discussion.[3] In March 1950 and July 1951, the Chinese and Soviet government signed four agreements, establishing a civil aviation company, an oil company, a non-ferrous and rare metal company, and a shipbuilding company jointly owned by the two countries.[4] Xibaipo was tiny village in Hebei Province where the Chinese Communist Party maintained headquarters from mid 1948 to early 1949. Dispatched by Stalin, Mikoyan secretly visited Xibaipo from 31 January to 7 February 1949 and held extensive meetings with Mao Zedong and other CCP leaders. For a Chinese account of Mikoyan’s visit, see Shi Zhe (trans. Chen Jian), “With Mao and Stalin: The Reminiscences of a Chinese Interpreter,” Chinese Historians 5:1 (Spring 1992), 45-56. For a Russian account of the visit, see Andrei Ledovsky, “Mikoyan’s Secret Mission to China in January and February 1949,” Far Eastern Affairs (Moscow) 2 (1995) 72-94. It is interesting and important to note that the Chinese and Russian accounts of this visit are in accord.[5] Mao Zedong attended the Moscow conference of leaders of communist and workers’ parties from socialist countries in November 1957, on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the Russian October Revolution.[6] The “Moscow Manifesto” was adopted by the Moscow conference of leaders of communist and workers’ parties from socialist countries in November 1957.[7] The 156 aid projects were mainly designed for China’s first five-year plan, focusing on energy development, heavy industry and defense industry.[8] Here Mao referred to two of Stalin’s telegrams to the CCP leadership around 20-22 August 1945, in which Stalin urged the CCP to negotiate a peace with the Guomindang, warning that failing to do so could cause “the danger of national elimination.”[9] Mao referred to his request to Stalin in 1950 to dispatch a philosopher to China to help edit Mao’s works. Stalin then sent Yudin to China, who, before becoming Soviet ambassador to China, was in China from July 1950 to January 1951 and July to October 1951, participating in the editing and translation of Mao Zedong’s works.[10] I. V. Kovalev, Stalin’s representative to China from 1948 to 1950, accompanied Mao Zedong to visit the Soviet Union in December 1949-February 1950; N. T. Fedorenko, a Soviet sinologist, in the early 1950s served as the cultural counselor at the Soviet embassy in Beijing.[11] Ye Fei commanded the Fujian Military District.[12] Mao commanded these military operations during the CCP-Guomindang civil war in 1927-1934.\n",

Comrade Gao Gang has returned and transmitted your opinion on various questions.I consider that they are all correct and we must do precisely thus.As regards the question of planting rubber trees, we intend immediately to start the planning.I hope that the Soviet government will send its representatives to assist us in formulating plans.2. Our troops' eight months of experience in conducting war in Korea has clearly shown the great difference in the equipment of our troops and the troops of the enemy and the extreme necessity of improving the equipment of our troops. This is why we commissioned Comrade Gao Gang to appeal to you with a request about delivery to us of arms for sixty divisions, to which you agreed. This is the minimal requirement of our troops in Korea for the present year.Upon his return Gao Gang said that you consider our requirements in arms for each division insufficient and proposed to strengthen each division with tanks and artillery.I consider this completely correct. This is necessary in war against imperialists.I already sent a telegram to Comrade Xu Xiangqian [with instructions] to conduct the negotiations fully in accordance with your opinion.3. According a telegram received from Comrade Xu Xiangqian after his preliminary negotiations with representatives of the Soviet General Staff, of the total quantity of arms for sixty divisions according to the calculation of the Soviet General Staff, arms for only sixteen divisions will be delivered this year (including for three Korean [divisions]), and arms for the remaining forty-four divisions will be delivered in 1952-1953. This is in contradiction to the needs and time frame of the Korean theater of military operations.4. For the goal of satisfying the urgent needs of the Korean theater of military operations, I ask you to study the applications transmitted by Comrade Gao Gang to Comrade Xu Xiangqian, and explore the possibility of fulfilling all deliveries of rifles, artillery, tanks, airplanes, automobiles, spare parts for automobiles and GSM, medicines and other military equipment, at 1/6 [of the total] monthly, from July to the end of the year, so that the various military units in the Korean theater of military operations receive replenishment according to the presently existing organizational structure, what is advantageous for the conduct of military operations.5. With the availability this year of deliveries of arms according to our applications, the missing quantity of arms needed for units in accordance with the new organizational structure proposed by the Soviet General Staff can be delivered in the next year. Simultaneously with this, in accordance with the delivery of arms, we will reorganize the selections for this division and in that way gradually convert the sixteen divisions to the new organization.6. We have delayed our applications for three months and have thus brought great harm to ourselves. Today we suddenly have appealed to you with such large numbers and want all this to be delivered in six months. This places before you great difficulties, especially in the area of transport. I do not know if this can be done. I ask you to do as much as is possible.MAO ZEDONGNo. 3107 21.6.51###\n",

FILIPPOV [Stalin]Ridgway, the Commanding General of enemy forces, made a statement today with a proposal that representatives of both warring sides meet on a Danish ship in the port of Wonsan for a meeting on a cessation of combat operations. He declared at the same time that an appropriate guarantee is required; only in this even might combat operations be halted.I inform you of my opinion on this question.Please study and give a reply, but also please inform Cde. Kim Il Sung of this directly.1. Cde. Kim Il Sung presumably should give a reply to Ridgway on 2 or 3 July. He should express agreement in this reply to hold negotiations [between] representatives of both sides about a cessation of combat operations and suggest a time, place, and number of participants of the meeting.2. As regards the place of holding the negotiations, Ridgway proposed the port of Wonsan.Considering that Wonsan is a fortified naval base of North Korea and the enemy intends to land a party there, it seems to me disadvantageous to agree to hold negotiations in Wonsan. Cannot a location on the 38th parallel be proposed for the negotiations, perhaps Kaidzio [sic; possibly Kaesong][?].3. In order to provide our representatives with time to fully prepare for the conference it seems to me advantageous to set 15 July as the date of the beginning of the meeting. 4.

I have received your two telegrams (of 24.6.51 and 28.6.51). I fully agree with your opinion.a) As regards the time periods for the delivery of armaments for sixteen divisions, we should act only on the basis of the productive and transport possibilities of the Soviet Union, that is [we should] complete the deliveries of arms for sixteen divisions in the course of three years, and in 1951 complete the deliveries for ten divisions.b) The staff-organizational structure you have proposed for the present Chinese infantry divisions is very good. We are implementing it. With sixteen divisions armed in accordance with this staff-organizational structure, the Chinese army will be far stronger than at present.2. Malik's statement secured us the initiative in the matter of conducting peace negotiations. On 28.6.51 I received through Comrade Roshchin the main positions of the contents of the conversation of Comrade Gromyko with the American ambassador to the Soviet Union, [Alan] Kirk. At the end of the text is stated: “Only two representatives must participate from each side. Moreover these representatives must be from the command of the corresponding military units, and not representatives of the governments.Thus, from the Chinese side a representative of the volunteer troops must participate and not a representative of China, as a warring state.” I consider this completely correct.I have received a telegram from Comrade Kim Il Sung in which he asks how he should answer if Ridgway calls for negotiations to begin.I have already communicated to Comrade Kim Il Sung and Peng Dehuai that on the one hand we must carefully watch the military situation so as not to give the enemy the possibility of using this moment to his advantage, and on the other hand Comrade Kim Il Sung and Peng Dehuai must discuss this question and be prepared, in case of a demand by the enemy to begin negotiations, to send corresponding representatives to conduct negotiations.As regards how to answer Ridgway, after receiving a demand from Ridgway, the contents should be discussed and an answer formulated. What is your opinion on this question?If negotiations begin, it is extremely necessary that you personally lead them, so that we do not find ourselves in a disadvantageous position.I send you for familiarization the telegram of Comrade Kim Il Sung.MAO ZEDONGNo. 326030.6\n",

In the future, in connection with the development of military operations, we will have a very great need to supply the army with ammunition. If there is no change in military production, then the rearmament can be begun in the second half of 1951.For overcoming the difficulties of the present time I ask you to review the question of the possibility of the delivery of small arms for 36 (thirty-six) divisions in the course of January and February 1951, according to the following list (name, quantity in pieces):1.

However, at the same time, taking into account internal and external politics, the American government is still trying to keep the international situation tense, and therefore the Americans, while actively engaged in spying and carrying out a policy of an advance in the course of the negotiations, are trying to drag out the negotiations.The main question in the negotiations is the determination of the demarcation line. In place of the demand for designation of the demarcation line deep in the rear of our troops, the enemy has proposed to designate it on the basis of the present line of the front, with some alterations and with the inclusion of the region of Kaesong in the buffer zone.At present the enemy is already demanding the designation of the line in fact contiguous with the line of the troops at the time of the signing of an agreement on cessation of military operations as the demarcation line without the inclusion of the region of Kaesong in the buffer zone. We are insisting on the cessation of military operations at the present front line and the designation of the present line contiguous to the troops of both sides as the demarcation line with the introduction of alterations in the line contiguous to troops of both sides in case of alterations of it in the period of the achievement of an agreement on all points of the agenda. At the present time the enemy is fighting with us precisely on this question, but we assume that this fight will not continue for long.Our proposal about cessation of military operations at the present front line and our agreement to set aside the question of the 38th parallel as the demarcation line, and the question of the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea before the convening of a political conference, was made not only because the present negotiations are negotiations about cessation of military operations and [because] the enemy will not in any case want to exchange eastern mountainous regions to the north of the 38th parallel for low-lying regions to the south of the 38th parallel, but also because in case the enemy refuses to leave the eastern mountainous regions we also have mountainous regions there [that are] advantageous for defense; as regards the western coastal plain to the south of the 38th parallel, it is advantageous for us because it has a much greater population than the eastern regions, and furthermore it is rich in agricultural products, plus the region of Kaesong is an advanced post for taking Seoul.Comrade Kim Il Sung during the discussion of armistice conditions in Beijing in June of this year had the same opinion on this question. This time it also was done with his agreement.As regards the discussion of the question of monitoring at the negotiations, we earlier suggested to propose to create an organ for cessation of military operations, in which would be included representatives of both sides, and to assign to it the task of monitoring the fulfillment of the conditions of the cessation of military operations and monitoring in the buffer zone.However, the enemy is sure to demand the establishment of monitoring in the rear of both sides, in order to limit the transport by both sides of reinforcements and military goods.We intend to agree to the establishment of monitoring at 1 or 2 border points of both sides and in accordance with your instructions to propose to transfer the monitoring functions to neutral states, in other words to states that are not participating in the war. We want to invite three states to fulfill these tasks: the Soviet Union, Poland and India.It is possible that the Americans will oppose this at the beginning. Then we will propose to introduce [as monitors] representatives from Sweden and one state of Latin America.As regards the exchange of prisoners of war, we will oppose exchange according to the principle of 1 for 1 and will propose exchange according to the principle of return of all prisoners of war by both sides.I think it will not be difficult to reach agreement on this question.On the question of the governments of the interested states convening a conference of high level officials, three variants are possible:1. Convening a conference of political representatives of both sides which are presently conducting negotiations. (It is possible that America will propose this variant.)2. Convening a conference with the participation of four states: the Soviet Union, China, America, England and representatives of North and South Korea.3. Convening a conference with participation of seven states: the Soviet Union, China, America, England, France, India, Egypt and representatives of North and South Korea.I ask you, proceeding from the international situation, to give instructions regarding which of the three variants is best or propose a new variant.At the present time, on the basis of the aforementioned we will achieve cessation of military operations this year. At the same time, we will carry out the necessary preparation in case of a dragging out of the negotiations by the enemy and their breakdown. Expecting that the negotiations will be drawn out for another half year or year, we have moved toward economizing on our human and material forces in the Korean theater of military operations and we are pursuing the tactics of a long, active defense, with the goal of holding the position we presently occupy and inflicting great manpower losses on the enemy, in order to gain victory in the war.Within the country we are preparing for the reorganization of the army, reduction of the bureaucracy, introduction of a regime of economizing, increasing production and further strengthening of the campaign to aid Korea and struggle against American imperialism, for the purpose of ensuring the further conduct of the war in Korea, securing also by financial means the stabilization of the scene within the country, and also strengthening state construction and mainly construction of defense.In the present year, in light of rendering aid to Korea and the struggle against American imperialism, the budget of the Chinese state in comparison with 1950 has increased by 60%. 32% of the total budget is directly being used in the Korean theater of military operations. (Military credit extended to us by the Soviet Government is not included in this calculation.)Thus, if a regime of economizing is not introduced now, in the next year the budget will increase even more, which inevitably will have an influence on finances and lead to a great rise in the prices of goods, which in turn will create difficulties at the front, and also in the area of construction in the rear. It is true that achieving peace as a result of the negotiations is advantageous for us, but we also are not afraid of dragging out the negotiations. Acting thus, we will surely be able to achieve victory. At the same time we will be able successfully to carry out various measures within the country and secure stabilization and further development in the area of politics and the economy.I ask your instructions on the above.MAO ZEDONGNo. 563114.11.51[...]\n",

I have received your telegram of 0115 18 October.At the present time at the meeting of liaison officers our side should keep to an approach which promotes the rapid resumption of the work of the conference. We should both not be in a hurry and not waste time.We should at our initiative and at an opportune moment propose means with which both sides could agree in order to solve some secondary issues.As regards measures or secondary issues which we intend to change we should not make changes right away; at the same time we should not reveal at the first meetings or in the press that our point of view is absolutely inflexible. On the contrary, we should prepare the ground for a subsequent change so that at the moment the change is made it does not appear sudden, as if we are making a big concession.Therefore your intention of giving instructions to correspondents to place a report in the press that the proposal our side has offered about the reduction of the Kaesong-Bunsan neutral zone and the neutral strip along the road between these points is a great concession is extremely inadvisable.The proposal we have offered is not any serious concession.In the event that the enemy does not agree we intend to reduce the neutral zone still further. Will this be a still greater concession after the great concession that was made? It is politically disadvantageous to make such a statement in the press this way.In reality, in the opinion of the enemy the move of the conference to [Hamonten], the responsibility of both sides for security, and the expansion of the neutral zone to Bunsan has not given them anything good.On the contrary, in this event enemy aircraft cannot fly over Bunsan, which is not in the enemy's interests. Therefore, since 7 October all the enemy press and public opinion has not considered this a concession by us, but on the contrary they note that there will be more trouble at [Hamonten] than at Kaesong.As regards the enemy, as before he is interested in using the meeting of liaison officers in order to stall for time and conduct intelligence.We should also act cautiously in order not to reveal our plans, which is to our advantage during the subsequent struggle at the conference.However, of the four alternatives proposed by the enemy it is apparent that the enemy is increasingly disinclined to reject the resumption of the work of the conference.Please be guided by my instructions.MAO ZEDONG 0530 18 October\"Nº 520519 OctoberMAO ZEDONG---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Deciphered by Fedyaev 1205 19 OctoberPrinted by Kornyushina 1250 19 October Nº 3007Eight copies printedVerified: Section Chief Colonel[signature] (Makarov)\n",

FILIPPOV.I am sending you information received by our information organization in TIANJIN:1. On 25 June the Fatherland Front of KOREA made a decision about holding general elections in the country on 20 October.This decision was made at a moment when peace talks between the CPC and the Kuomintang were broken off, but units of the PLA had forced the Yangtze River and occupied the cities of SHANGHAI, NANKING, etc. These events raised the mood and morale of the population of South KOREA.At the same time the democratic leaders of North and South KOREA thought that this political offensive is a precondition of a military offensive which should be conducted in October. Their leadership also thought this was its strategic goal and therefore planned their work in this direction and sent large groups of cadre to South KOREA to perform underground work in order to prepare an action [vystuplenie] in October.The Worker’s Party of KOREA has actively mobilized the popular masses to support this struggle. The population of South KOREA also thought that the time was already ripe to display its loyal attitude. Thus both the progressive and also sympathetic elements were inspired to take part in the struggle. They either sheltered and protected revolutionary leaders or gave active support – they prepared for the action on time. At that time this fact forced SYNGMAN RHEE to abandon the forcible implementation of the military service law. 2. However, only minor clashes occurred during July at the 38th parallel, and by October complete calm was observed.A fourth session of the supreme council of the popular assembly was convened in North KOREA in October at which a fundamental amendment to the previously planned line was introduced.Explanations were made about this among senior officials that the goal of the political offensive had already been achieved, and inasmuch as South KOREA is not acting, therefore it is also not right for North KOREA to make the first shot. But this explanation was not made among low-level officials.3. The population of South KOREA was extremely disappointed as a result of all of this. Many think that the Worker’s Party had deceived them.The majority of officials sent to South KOREA from North KOREA were unmasked [or] compromised. The unworthy of them went over to the side of the enemy, but the sympathizers drew back.The reactionaries began reprisals in South KOREA beginning with the second half of October: almost all the members of the city committee of the Worker’s Party in SEOUL were arrested, thus its main position in South KOREA collapsed.The majority of the remaining senior officials from the CC of the Worker’s Party were also arrested except PAK [HYUNG-SIK] and some other people who sold out to the enemy.4. At the present time discussions about the political line have begun inside the Worker’s Party and the Fatherland Front.Both the revolutionary officials as well as sympathizers in South KOREA as well as sympathizers and people who took part in this struggle complain that the political slogans are not being implemented in practice. Now a loss has been inflicted by the enemy which has increased the difficulty in the matter of the unification and incorporation of South KOREA. It is especially sad that almost everything that the officials sent to South KOREA have been lost right now.I don’t know whether the above information corresponds to reality. But if it does then we ought to pay serious attention to this.[Translator’s note: the following paragraph was highlighted in the left MAO ZEDONG 21 October 1949”Nº 234 KOVALEV 23 OctoberDeciphered by Finenko at 0840 24 OctoberPrinted by Doronchenkova at 0920 24 OctoberFive copies printed, copy Nº 5 to fileNº 6998Verified by the shift chief – [illegible signature] 1100\n",

      "During a discussion with I. Urian, Park Young Seo, Director of the Press Section of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that, because of increase in tension between the North and the South and the recent events, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea doesn't expect for today's meeting, April 18, in Panmunjom, to bring new developments in the preparation for contacts between the two prime-ministers.At the moment, the North has concluded that the South Korean side is not interested and cannot engage in talks regarding the fate of the country. In reality, the South Korean president, the prime minister and the government have been appointed temporarily and avoid approaching problems that might endanger their position in the next elections in the first half of 1981.The South Korean opposition leaders’ wish to rise to power and their fear of suffering the consequences of the rules of the martial law during the elections compelled them to comply with the government's policy, to ignore the Democratic People's Republic of Korea’s letters and proposals and to make harsh declarations against the North.The lack of a positive reaction from the South Korean population towards the North's proposals to have a large political dialogue for the reunification of the country was also explained through the existence of the martial law which limits the freedom of expression.The South's insistences on the necessity of setting a fixed agenda for the meeting between the two prime-ministers seek to limit the topics discussed during the meetings and joint actions like the ones that take place between two countries. This way, it can avoid having concrete discussions and engagements regarding the reunification of the country.The Democratic People's Republic of Korea is decided to act for the continuation of the dialogue in order for the meetings between the two prime-ministers to happen, regardless of these hardships, even if, in the end, those meetings will be only between governmental officials, as the South insists.Signed, Paul Marinescu.\n",

      "To the Relations - First Section in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,Regarding the evolution of the preparations for restarting the North-South dialogue, from the discussions with a secretary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs resulted the following: 1. If special problems won't be raised regarding the representatives that will participate to the preparatory meeting scheduled on January 6, the meeting between the two prime ministers could take place in the third week of February.  A section Deputy Chief of the Central Committee of the Workers Party of Korea, counselor in the Administrative Council will participate on the behalf of North Korea - South Korea proposed for the meeting to take place between Deputy Ministers.The Korean diplomat put emphasis on the fact that the Prime Minister of South Korea accepting to participate to a meeting where problems regarding the future of the country will be discussed is a great victory for the unification policy promoted by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. However, it is only a partial success as there were no answers to the other letters sent to the opposition party leaders and dignitaries in South Korea.2. By analyzing different information regarding this problem, it resulted that the Korean side is concerned and even worried by the fact that its letters didn't produce the anticipated response from the opposition in South Korea. Many of the dignitaries that received a letter ignored this act, motivating that the vice-president Kim Il is not an equivalent dignitary and therefore he isn't negotiating from the same position. Other dignitaries had a negative, even extreme reaction to the North's initiatives. Kim Yeong-sam [Kim Young-sam], the president of the New Democratic Party, the main opposing party, presented the North Korean actions as a general peaceful offensive. Also, Kim Dae Jung, one of the leaders of the New Democratic Party as well as former president of South Korea, Yun Posun [Yun Bo-seon] - convicted to 2 years in prison for breaking the martial law- made declarations against the North and its totalitarian communist regime, supporting the necessity of forming a strong government in order to withstand the North's plots.We don't regard the official excuses, which say that the lack of a reply to the letters from other dignitaries is caused by the pressures of the South Korean authorities, as real.The Democratic People's Republic of Korea's concern for the results of its initiatives is based on other elements as well. In this regard, by meeting with more official governmental representatives of South Korea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will be placed into a situation where it has to officially recognize exactly what it doesn't want to: the reality of the existence of two separated states and two separated governments, which is exactly what South Korea has been planning for a long time.In order to avoid this situation, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea authorities are putting emphasis on the necessity for the discussions to take place between the political personalities of the North and the South. It is even said that the dialogue mustn't be monopolized by special categories of representatives.Signed, Paul Marinescu.\n",

      "To Comrade Constantin Oancea, Deputy Minister,Regarding the first meeting in Panmunjom between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea 's delegation led by Hyeon Jung Gik, section deputy chief [and not Deputy Director as stated in the \"Scanteia\" newspaper on January 31] of the Central Committee of the Workers’ Party of Korea and counselor in the administrative council and the South Korean delegation led by Kim Young Ju, ambassador-at-large; Comrade I. Urian participated on the behalf of the Romanian Embassy, we are reporting the following : 1. During the introductory discussions, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's representative presented the North's concerns for the reunification of the country, including the recent letters that haven't received and answer yet and put emphasis on the fact that the meeting between the two prime ministers can only be seen as \"a small chain loop\" in a larger dialogue between North and South.The South Korean representative proposed to stop giving festive, good-intention speeches and to move on directly to approaching concrete and practical problems regarding the preparations for the meeting between the two prime ministers.2. At the request of the North, the South's representative made the following general requests: -The phone lines between North and South should be reconnected immediately;- The meetings should be short and generally behind closed doors; - Everything should be done in order to prevent incidents and the outbreak of a war between the North and South; - Conditions must be ensured for the 10 million people that have relatives in North or South Korea to be able to meet each other;- Delegation exchanges in sports, culture etc.3. Regarding the preparations for the meeting between the two prime ministers, the South proposed the following: - The meeting place must be Geneva; -The two prime ministers must be accompanied by a small number of ministers, deputies and counselors; - The meeting's agenda must be planned beforehand; - On the table there should only be the business cards of the prime ministers, no flags; - Recording the meetings must be possible, including on tape; - An assessment of the conversations will be made; - The results of the negotiations will be published as they progress.4. Commenting on some of the South's proposals, the North Korean representative insisted on setting the meeting place in Pyongyang or Seoul, the participation of 60 people - councilors and journalists- , ensuring the security of the delegates coming from the other side, the length of the visit and the way of supporting the costs and some issues regarding the publicity.We noticed that the North's representative didn't answer the questions of the South's representatives if the Democratic People's Republic of Korea changed its position expressed in the letter sent on January 11, 1980 were it is mentioned that a meeting could take place in a different country.We also noticed that during the press conference after the meeting and afterwards, the mass media broadcasts in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea made it look like the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was the one that came up with concrete initiatives and it is the South that currently has to reply.5. From the discussions with the Korean representatives including Hyeon Jung Gik and our on-site observations, we conclude that it is possible for the meeting between the leaders of the governments of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and South Korea to take place. From South Korea' point of view, this kind of meeting as well as the possible agreements seek to obtain the official recognition as an independent state from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea .The Democratic People's Republic of Korea sees the meeting between the prime ministers only as the beginning of a dialogue between the North and the South. The dialogue will eventually include a large number of representatives from the two sides.For this reason, we think that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will make great efforts in order to bring other representatives from South Korea into the negotiations, at least for the next period, in order to avoid negotiations only between the leaders of the two governments; South Korea interprets this as being officially recognized by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (as an individual state).6. As first results of the meeting on February 6, we noticed that the phone lines have been reconnected, but only for discussing problems related to the preparations for the meeting between the prime ministers and that the next meeting is scheduled to take place on February 19 this year.Signed, Paul Marinescu.\n",

      "To Comrade Ambassador Vasile Sandru,The second meeting of the North and South Korean delegations, to discuss the preparation for the talks between the prime ministers of the two countries, took place in Panmunjom on February 19, 1980. We report the following:1. Hyeon Jung Gik, chief of the North Korean delegation, declared during the press conference organized at the end of the meeting that the two sides had common or similar points of view regarding the problems that were discussed - the nature of the conferences, the number of delegates, the methods used for recording the meetings and informing the public opinion.There are still disagreements about the meeting place and the agenda of the meetings between the prime ministers of North and South Korea. The North declined the South Korean proposal for the negotiations take place in Geneva motivating that a meeting between the prime ministers of the North and South Korea shouldn't take place in a third-party country; it is a meeting between countrymen to discuss internal problems and not a meeting between the prime ministers of different countries. Regarding the initial proposal of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea where it is mentioned the possibility for a meeting to take place in a third-party country, the North Korean side explained that it can be taken into consideration, but only in extreme cases and not as a norm.In order to prevent any elements that would lead to the acceptance of the \"theory of the two Koreas and the mutual recognition\", the North Korean side insisted on every occasion that the meeting between the two prime ministers is an integral part of the multilateral contacts that will take place between North and South Korea.The South Korean proposal for the agenda of the meeting between the two prime ministers to be established beforehand was declined. The North Korean side explained that the focus of a meeting where the promotion of the North-South dialogue and the reunification of the country will be discussed cannot be limited to fixed topics.During the meeting the sides agreed on the following: 1. The meetings will be open as well as behind closed doors. The agenda will be agreed upon by the two sides every time.2. Each side will receive a copy of the documents agreed upon and signed by both sides.3. The method for recording the meetings will be chosen by each side: magnetic tapes, filming, and stenography.4. The news broadcasts will be prepared under the scrutiny of both sides. In some cases, common news can be published.5. The date of the meeting between the prime ministers will be set based on the development of the working sessions.6. In the conference room, special signs/markings will not be used. Only the business cards of the two prime ministers will be displayed.The next meeting will take place in Panmunjom in a South Korean building on March 4.The Democratic People's Republic of Korea sides considers the results of the second meeting to be important and positive.2. The Soviet and Chinese diplomats that went to Panmunjom to participate to the meeting between the North and the South expressed their confusion caused by the North Korean side's affirmation that the Korean problem is not an international problem. This contradicts the actions taken in the last few years by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea when it promoted the Korean problem as an international problem that depends on the peace and security in Asia and in the world.A Chinese diplomat mentioned that in the context of the current complex situation in the area, as a result of the changes in the relations between China and the United States of America, China and Japan and the USSR and the United States of America, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is calling upon the forces of the nation to solve its internal problems alone more than ever to.In the diplomatic circles in Pyongyang, it is rumored that Indonesia is ready to offer its services as a mediator between the two Korean sides, considering its good relations with Pyongyang and Seoul.An agreement in this regard is indicated by the permanent presence of a large number of Indonesian diplomats, including the Indonesian ambassador in Pyongyang, to both of the meetings in Panmunjom between the representatives of North and South Korea.Signed, Paul Marinescu - Ambassador.\n",

      "To Comrade Constantin Oancea, Deputy Minister,We'd like to inform you that Choi Kyu-hah, the president of South Korea, held the annual conference today, January 18, 1980. It was broadcasted by radio and TV stations in South Korea. We are reporting some of the more significant elements:1. The internal situation is unstable, in political and economic terms, as a result of the events in the past few months - the assassination of Park Chung Hee and the coup d'état attempt on December 12, 1979 - and the economic difficulties caused by the oil crisis and inflation.2. This situation was also influenced by the conflict in Indochina, by the complexity of the problems in the Middle East and Iran and the foreign military intervention in Afghanistan.As a result of the Sino-Japanese treaty and the normalization of Sino-American relations, South Korea noticed an increased rapprochement between the United States of America, the People's Republic of China and Japan, rapprochement that will influence the evolution of the situation on the Korean peninsula.Externally, South Korea will continue to develop its relations, first of all with the United States of America and Japan. At the same time it will extend its relations with the ASEAN countries and non-aligned countries. It will seek to normalize its relations with countries of other political persuasions.3. The South Korean president considers that the recent proposals and initiatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to restart the North-South dialogue are part of a false peaceful offensive that seeks to worsen the contradictions between the different factions in South Korea, to create dissensions between the United States of America and South Korea and to distract the American public opinion before the presidential elections.Pointing out that the unification of the country is a national desideratum, a historical task that must be fulfilled only through 'peaceful means' and after ensuring a lasting peace on the peninsula, President Choi Kyu-hah has reiterated South Korea's previous proposals for restarting the North-South dialogue. It will be done through the representatives of the Red Cross groups and the Coordination Committee, through economic and technical-scientific exchanges as well as starting tripartite negotiations between South Korea, the United States of America and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.The recent letter sent by Ri Jeong-ok [Li Jong Ok], the premier of the Administrative Council of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, to the Prime Minister of South Korea was considered to be the \"first positive reaction from the North\" to the South's proposal for meetings and discussions to take place between the authorized representatives of the two sides.The president of South Korea declared that he is ready to adopt an active, positive, and serious position in analyzing the letter –which proposes a meeting between prime ministers - and that the South Korean government will deliver an official answer in the next few days.Signed, Paul Marinescu.\n",

      "To Comrade Constantin Oancea, Deputy Minister,From the discussions with comrade Pak Seong-cheol [Pak Song Chol] regarding the internal situation, resulted the following:1. In 1979, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea had good results in both industry and agriculture, having produced 9 million tons of cereal, the largest harvest in the history of the country.The main concern in 1980 will be reaching the goals set by the economic plan before October, when the 6th Congress of the Workers’ Party of Korea will take place.During the meetings of the 6th Congress of the Workers Party of Korea a serious analysis of what has been realized so far is foreseen. An activity plan for the future will be established based on the positive experience and the conclusions that can be drawn.2. Regarding the current situation in South Korea, comrade Pak Seong-cheol said that the situation is very complicated and confusing, especially after the death of Park Chung Hee. A fight for power between different factions has been noticed and continues to persist in the framework of the new leadership.The actions taken on the forefront for the democratization of the South Korean Society, including the abrogation of the martial law, are insignificant as the repressive movements continue even without this law.The masses applied a lot of pressure on the new authorities for the modification of the constitution and for ensuring democratic rights and freedoms. The new authorities can't ignore this situation and took measures in this respect, but they didn't change the essence of the old regime too much. For now, it can be stated that a regime of the same type as the one from the time of Park Chung Hee has been established in South Korea, but without Park Chung Hee.However, the DRPK hasn't abandoned the idea of restarting the dialogue with the South; this dialogue will create the necessary conditions for the reunification of the country. Because of this [desire to resume talks with the South], a proposal to form a joint team to participate in the Olympic Games in Moscow was sent [to Seoul], but the South Korean side hasn't replied so far.We observe the restraint of the leadership of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea from publicly criticizing the new South Korean authorities.Signed, Paul Marinescu.\n",

      "To Comrade Constantin Oancea, Deputy Minister,I was recently summoned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by Kim Je-sook - the Deputy Minister. He told me the following:The recent proposals of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, covered in the letters addressed by the vice president Kim Il and Prime Minister Ri Jeong-ok [Li Jong Ok] to different dignitaries in South Korea, are an expression of the efforts sustained by the Workers’ Party of Korea and the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in order to restart the dialogue for the peaceful and independent reunification of the country.The goal behind the proposals is to find the fastest way to restart the dialogue. Currently, after the death of the dictator Park Chung-hee, the best option is to improve the relations between North and South Korea. It is necessary to act fast in order to prevent the current leaders in the South from continuing the dictatorship policy and the division of the country and to create a favorable impression internally and externally. The measures taken by the current leaders for the so-called democratization and liberation of the country are not conclusive as the arrest of dignitaries with democratic views - including Yun Posun [Yun Bo-Seon], the former South Korean president - continues.Based on the current data, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea expects that the new South Korean administration will continue the repression of the progressive forces after returning the political and military situation back to a normal state.The current proposals of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea are very flexible and ask for leaving the old dissensions between the North and the South in the past. They offer a reasonable, realistic framework for restarting the dialogue and finding the ways for a peaceful reunification.The Democratic People's Republic of Korea considers that the echo and the reactions of the South Korean population and internationally, including the public opinion in the United States of America, are positive. In this regard, the spokesman of the United States State Department stated that the new proposals of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea are flexible and positive, during a declaration on January 15, 1980.It looks like the political circles in South Korea were surprised by the new proposals of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, making the South Korean president Choi Kyu-hah to postpone the annual press conference for a few days in order to declare, on this occasion, - see the telegram 057025 sent on January 18, 1980 - that he will reply after a thorough analysis of the proposals, at an appropriate time.The deputy minister expressed the gratitude of the Workers Party of Korea and the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the unwavering and active support of the Romanian Communist Party and Government towards the policy for the reunification of Korea.This support and active solidarity have been carried out by publishing detailed materials in the Romanian press and by dignitaries in the Socialist Republic of Romania who adopted a position on this issue.The Deputy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs requested for this report to be sent to the Romanian government, expressing his conviction that the Socialist Republic of Romania will continue to actively and consistently support the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's efforts in finding ways and methods to restore the national unity.A counselor in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs mentioned that such reports are only presented to the ambassadors of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the Popular Republic of China and the Socialist Republic of Romania.We will continue to follow and report the evolution of the events.Signed, Paul Marinescu.\n",

The meeting will take place in Panmunjeom, in a building called \"The House of Freedom\" - situated on the South Korean side of the demarcation line -, on February 6 or in a different location that will be decided upon during a working session between deputy ministers.

      "TELEGRAM 066.982To: the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Comrade Constantin Oancea, Vasile Sandru, Marcel Dinu)From: the Romanian Embassy in PyongyangDate: November 2nd, 1978 Classification: SecretThroughout 1978 there was no progress in Korean-Japanese relations as a result of the harsh and sometimes hostile attitude adopted by the Japanese government towards the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, on the Korean problem in general.As public materials and the recent conversation of Victor Nanu and Necula Coilogut with Ha Sang-cheol [sic] a specialist on Japan in the North Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Japan continues its hostile policy towards the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea – it actively supports the cross-recognition of the two Koreas, their separate admission to the UN, undertakes actions for the permanent division of Korea, for the maintenance of the balance of forces in Korea, provides material and political support to South Korea.All these represent a big hurdle for the process of normalizing Korean-Japanese relations, [and] establishing diplomatic relations between the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and Japan.Ha Sang-cheol [sic] said that given that the Japanese government promoted a hostile policy towards the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, the Korean government did not wish to normalize relations with Japan; this problem could be discussed only after the reunification of Korea.At the same time we noticed that the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea intensely tried to maintain and develop its relations with Japan and the ties with the Korean residents in Japan, on a non-governmental basis. As a result of the relentless activity of the Korean government, during the first ten months of 1978, 30 Japanese delegations visited the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, in addition to two delegations of the Communist Party in Japan, a delegation of the parliamentary association for the development of friendly ties between Korea and Japan, commercial delegations, co-nationals’ delegations. In the 10 months of the current year, four Korean delegations visited Japan, such as the labor union delegation and the delegation of the Workers’ Union of the Socialist Youth.A sustained activity is being conducted in Japan by a series of civic organizations and bodies, such as: the Juche Ideology Study Group, the Japanese committee of solidarity with the fight for the peaceful and independent unification of Korea, the League for promoting Japanese-Korean friendly ties, the Japanese-Korean association for cultural exchange etc. which have a loyal attitude towards the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, and support the position of the Korean government on different issues.As the Korean diplomat shows, the delegations exchanges, the mentioned bodies and organizations, and the sustained activity of the General Associations of the Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryeon), have the purpose of developing and consolidating the Korean-Japanese friendship, the collaboration at different levels, on a governmental level, the promotion of the position of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and of the peaceful and independent unification of Korea to the Japanese public, and the assurance and support for the legal rights of the Chongryeon association, defending the national and democratic rights of Korean citizens in Japan.As public materials show, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea supports such activities, seeing them as efficient opportunities and methods to maintain contacts and take action to create a current of opinion within the community of Korean residents in Japan favorable supporting the reunification of Korea, to determine a change in the policies of the Japanese government towards the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea or at least an improvement, for normalizing Korean-Japanese rapports.Because of Japan’s attitude towards the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, the Korean authorities encounter many difficulties: the visits of delegations are generally unilateral, the Japanese government does not allow the entrance of certain delegations and Korean figures; the delegations of the Korean Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee, the committee for cultural relations with the foreign countries, the democratic front for the reunification of Korea etc. were not given visas. When delegations’ visits in Japan are allowed, contacting Korean residents and conducting political activity are forbidden, and it is requested that the duration of the visit be as short as possible.Referring to the mentioned difficulties, Ha Sang-cheol [sic] said that “we were not discouraged, we don’t kneel in front of the governors from Tokyo.The actions and the position of the Japanese government are condemned by the international public opinion.We will continue to allow the Japanese delegations to visit our country.”Given the current situation in the region, the  Korean official added, “the friendly relations between Japan, the US, and South Korea, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is not expecting an improvement of the rapports with Japan.In conclusion, the embassy believes that Korean-Japanese relations at the non-governmental level, with all the known difficulties, are conducted in satisfactory conditions. Delegations of Korean residents from Japan, Japanese delegations from different fields of activity including trade are almost constantly in Pyongyang.The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is well organized, and has a great influence among the general associations of Korean residents in Japan – Chongryeon, has good relations and prestige among many influent Japanese figures with important positions in Parliament , Government etc.  Only this explains the large volume of Korean-Japanese trade which the Korean authorities avoid to talk about. (The total volume of forecasted trade for 1977 amounted to 400 million US dollars, according to some unofficial sources.)In this context, we would like to mention that the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea funds the tuition of Korean pupils and students who live in Japan. From 1957 until now, the amounts remitted by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to Chongryeon for education exceed 25 million yens.Even though an improvement in Korean-Japanese rapport is not foreseen, we notice that the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is conducting a sustained activity for normalizing, in perspective, the relations between the two countries. Compared with the previous period, we notice a certain change in the official position of Japan regarding the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. The Japanese authorities’ approval of the organization of the Scientific Conference on the Juche ideology in Tokyo in October, is significant in this respect.We believe that the relatively harsh attitude of the Korean government towards Japan is caused by its position on the Korean question; if Japan changed its point of view on the Korean question, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea would take more resolute actions for normalizing relations with Japan.In this respect, the fact that Japan is not interested in starting a military conflict on the Korean peninsula and that it does not want nuclear weapons to exist in the area must also be taken into account.On economic issues, [Japan] is interested in having good relations with the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, where it can find a good marketplace for Japanese goods.Even though until the end of the year a series of important American-Japanese-South Korean contacts are to be taking place, such as the visit of the American State Secretary [sic] [Harold] Brown to Seoul and Tokyo, the visit of the Prime-Minister Fukuda to Seoul etc., we believe  that in the near future there will not be [any] substantial modifications regarding the relations between  the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and Japan.Signed Paul Marinescu\n",

He justified it by saying that if China were to help Korea, then that would essentially draw the USSR into war.Such a decision doesn’t work given the overall political situation as it stands today because it would lead to a third world war, and besides that, although the Chinese army is large, they don’t have modern weapons, aviation, and a navy. He recommended the Koreans to continue the struggle on the front and on the home front. He underscored the importance of organizing guerilla warfare. He said that Kim Il Sung can use Manchuria as if it were his own territory.After a discussion of the current military situation in Korea—the Politburo of the Worker’s Party allegedly made the decision that although there will not be any outside armed assistance, the struggle should continue, withdraw to the mountains, and prepare shock army for future offences. In South Korea they should create a guerilla movement with Ri Seung-yop [Ri Sung Yop] at its head. In the North, during the retreat, they should also establish guerilla detachments under the leadership of Pak Il-u .We have not yet been directly informed about the return of Pak Il-u  and about the meeting of the Politburo.  Matveev\n",

      "GDR Embassy to DPRKPyongyang, 13 March 1972N o t e on a Conversation with the 1st Secretary of the USSR Embassy, Comrade Kurbatov, on 10 March 1972 in the GDR EmbassyDuring the conversation there was an exchange of opinions on the following questions:The DPRK Position on the Nixon Visit to Beijing and Its Influence on the Situation in KoreaBased on a written draft, Comrade Kurbatov asserted the DPRK reaction demonstrates how the Korean leadership is very content with the result, in particular with the inclusion of the Korea Problem into the [Shanghai] Communiqué between China and the United States. It [Korean leadership] is very pleased with the support of the DPRK Eight-Point Proposal and the demand to dissolve UNCURK. The Korean leaders think that the Chinese maintained a firm position on Korea. As “Rodong Sinmun” writes, the Korean leadership is viewing this as a great assistance “by the fraternal Chinese people”. During Nixon’s actual stay in Beijing, the Koreans stated how the DPRK position was laid out in Kim Il Sung’s speech from 6 August 1971. Nixon would not arrive in Beijing as a victor but as a defeated. This Korean position had been reiterated in the [Kim Il Sung] interview with [the Japanese newspaper] “Yomiuri Shimbun” [in January 1972]. The Nixon visit was interpreted as forced upon the American president. This way the Korean side assisted China’s policy and agreed to the discussion of the Korean question in the talks.In its publications the Korean leadership attempts to hide from its people the parallel interests of China and the United States. It is pursuing its nationalist course and fails to notice the anti-Soviet aspect of rapprochement between the Chinese leadership and the United States. The Korean leadership asserts China is a “socialist power,” “stands firm on the basis of proletarian internationalism,” and so on. The Korean leadership’s position entirely consists of a course of pragmatism. In their policy toward the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, the Korean leaders are increasingly guided by pragmatic considerations. They are eager to achieve Korean unification primarily with Chinese assistance. It became evident that, in preparation for the talks with Nixon, Chinese leaders were not interested in tensions on the Korean peninsula (like, for instance, during the declaration of a state of emergency in South Korea). The Chinese were successful to move the Korean leadership from its entrenched position. The inclusion of the Korean question into the talks in Beijing, which had occurred not without the knowledge of the Koreans, speaks to new elements in relations between DPRK and China and to new aspects in the Chinese leadership’s policy towards the DPRK. The Chinese increasingly take matters to solve the Korean question into their own hands.Kim Il Sung’s visit to Beijing—which allegedly did not occur in early February according to the official version—served the purpose of finalizing the exact joint position on the Korean question for the talks with Nixon. Also the stay of a group of Koreans in Beijing in permanent close touch with the Chinese side further demonstrated the increased stability of relations between the two sides. The Korean side denies a visit by Kim Il Sung to Beijing. Yet Chinese diplomats do not express denials but indicate how permanent consultations are possible, and a visit must hot have been unusual. It can be assumed that the Koreans and Chinese recently had another exchange of opinions about the Nixon visit. The [“Rodong Sinmun”] editorial of March 4 seems to be an indication of that. It can be expected in this context that steps will be taken to create a favorable situation for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea. The Korean leadership views such as its main objective in the near future. Information exists according to which the Korean leadership has been continuously informed by secret material about the course of negotiations with Nixon. The talks with him in Beijing proved that China and the United States have common interests and want to resolve Asian and other problems without the Soviet Union. He [Kurbatov] also referred to differing assessments of the Nixon visit by DPRK and DRV [Democratic republic of Vietnam].I thanked Comrade Kurbatov for his presentation and informed him in turn about the evaluation of the Nixon visit by our Embassy.Note: A comparison of the text of the [Shanghai] communiqué between China and the United States and the published version in the DPRK press shows that it was printed almost verbatim with only few omissions: The last sentence in the first paragraph, the third paragraph, the term “Republic [of] Korea,” and the last paragraph.Conversation of Comrade Brezhnev with Foreign Minister Heo Dam [Ho Tam] in MoscowHere Comrade Kurbatov remarked that Comrade Heo Dam told Comrade Brezhnev that the DPRK will assume a new position towards Japan. There are also new elements in Japan’s attitude towards the DPRK. Another aspect of the talks with Comrade Brezhnev were Comrade Heo Dam’s statements concerning the United Nations. The DPRK, according to Comrade Heo Dam, is expecting from the Soviet Union and the socialist countries to support and defend DPRK position in the U.N. The PR China would stand up and support the DPRK there as well. Comrade Heo Dam continued how it would be positive if the socialist countries will act in the U.N. in a coordinated and identical fashion with China’s positions.The issues of Japan and the U.N. were not included in the “Joint Message” [of USSR and DPRK on the visit]. Comrade Brezhnev just listened to the statements on Japan and remarked about the U.N. that this question warrants close study.Comrade Kurbatov stated furthermore that currently the Soviet Union is excluding an attack by the South against the North.On DPRK-PRC relations Comrade Heo Dam noticed the improvement of relations, though they had not occurred at the expense of DPRK relations with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. Moreover, Comrade Heo Dam said in his talk [with Brezhnev] that the Chinese side will be fully informed about what the Korean side expressed in its talk with the Soviet comrades. Although it is an important question, there had been no [Korean-Soviet] consultations about party relations [KWP-CPSU] on this level [Brezhnev-Heo Dam].Later Ambassador Sudarikov will inform more extensively about the Heo Dam visit.Some Aspects of KWP Activity in the Communist World MovementBased on a written draft, Comrade Kurbatov made the following remarks:In 1971 and 1972 the KWP continued relations with communist and workers’ parties. It participated in party congresses of several parties and practiced exchanges of delegations. It invited delegations from different parties to the DPRK. As previously, the KWP builds its party relations on a bilateral basis and refrains from multilateral cooperation. It increases its efforts to summarize the ideology of Juche into a comprehensive system and declares Kim Il Sung’s Juche ideology as the only basis for party activities. The 5th Party Congress pushed through a petit bourgeois, nationalist line contradicting socialist development. These nationalist tendencies and the strengthening of relations with China have increased some negative tendencies in the communist movement and in KWP relations to the communist and workers’ movement. Despite official KWP declarations about the need to build relations with individual parties on the basis of Marxism-Leninism, by its actual activities in the international communist movement the KWP is contradicting Marxism-Leninism with the nationalist Juche ideology, and proletarian internationalism with “autonomy” and “independence.”The KWP leadership does not consider the experiences of the communist world movement, and it does not follow the collectively agreed decisions of fraternal parties. Instead it praises Kim Il Sung as an eminent leader of the communist and workers’ movement and praises him as a genius of the revolution. The KWP is guided by his works where he “provided wise analysis of the features in the current international situation.” It is guided by Kim Il Sung as “a leader of the anti-imperialist forces” because his ideas “accelerate the demise of imperialism and guide the world revolution on the path of victory.” Kim Il Sung’s works, his statements during internal meetings with foreign party officials, and his published speeches invite the assumption that he has a negative view of theory and practice of the construction of socialism and communism in the Soviet Union and the socialist fraternal countries. Apparently he sees the path to socialism in the DPRK as the “only correct and exemplary one for other countries”. For instance, he declared in a conversation with the delegation of the leftist party of Swedish communists visiting the DPRK that he does not agree with the CPSU course to develop the Soviet Union as a people’s state, since in his opinion such leads to a weakening of the dictatorship of the proletariat.According to Kim Yeong-nam [Kim Yong Nam], Deputy Head of the [International] Department IV in the [KWP] Central Committee, who based his statement on sayings by Kim Il Sung, “individual countries where the proletariat has risen to power cannot ignore the facts of a danger of imperialist aggression and the restoration of capitalism through encirclement by the international capital, before communism will be eventually established on a global scale.”Based on Kim Il Sung’s ideas, the Koran propaganda is currently leading a broad campaign that defines as supporters of revisionism all parties which do not agree with positions of Kim Il Sung on questions like personality cult, dictatorship of the proletariat, class struggle, and so on. In this context a couple of embassies from the socialist countries have reached the conclusion that such a campaign leads to the development of camouflaged anti-Sovietism in the DPRK.All this said and considered, the appeals by the Korean leaders for unity and closeness of the communist movement are just declaratory in nature, dishonest, and they are not corroborated by practical measures. The tendency becomes ever more clear that the KWP leadership does not focus on the unity of the communist world movement but aims at the revolutionary peoples of the world, of which the so-called united front of the revolutionary people in Asia constitutes the core (Korea, China, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos). This approach testifies to a gradual departure from the class position of proletarian internationalism for a transition towards a nationalist, pragmatic position. In this context internal Korean propaganda has begun to claim that the “socialist countries have lost their revolutionary spirit and therefore can currently serve only as a material base for the struggle of the revolutionary peoples.” In public propaganda this position was to be found in somewhat modified form in the “Rodong Sinmun” article “Let us defend the Dictatorship of the Proletariat and the Proletarian Democracy.”As the KWP is counting China among the revolutionary countries, and based on the ideological and political closeness of positions [between DPRK and PRC], we have to conclude that the KWP is on the path to solidify party relations with China. Since 1971 they exchange party delegations. Korean propaganda welcomed the “assignments for the struggle” by the so-called 9th Party Congress of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), as well as the implementation of the so-called “Cultural Revolution.” A “Rodong Sinmun” article celebrating the 50th CCP Anniversary claimed, “after the Cultural Revolution, the CCP turned into an even more pure, steeled and strong party.”KWP and PRC have established contacts and organize informational changes. In the DPRK the Chinese journal “Hongqi” continues to be circulated. In pursuing its own goals, the KWP leadership does not pay attention to the anti-Soviet aspects of China’s foreign policy. At the same time it comes close to Chinese positions, as it showed in particular concerning the events in Sudan, India/Pakistan and the Middle East.Recently the KWP has increasingly activated its relationship with the Albanian Workers’ Party. So far DPRK efforts have not resulted in desired Korean reactions on the Albanian side, they only activated bilateral relations on the state level. For the occasion of important anniversaries they exchanged congratulations to underline traditional and friendly relations. The most active development of relations is the one with the Romanian Communist Party (RCP) on a nationalist base and under the labels of “autonomy” and “independence” of the parties. Contacts between KWP and RCP are activated according to an agreement from 1971.KWP participation in the party congresses of the fraternal parties in 1971 (Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Mongolia, GDR, Poland, Soviet Union) has not resulted in progress of relations between the parties. The gatherings were used by the KWP leadership as a podium to propagate its special positions in front of the international communist movement, namely to emphasize “autonomy” and “independence” of parties as the base for their mutual relations.The KWP leadership is departing from an exchange of experiences and delegations with the fraternal parties. For instance, despite respective agreements, there were no party officials sent in 1971 for vacations in our respective countries. The KWP leadership pays close attention to the tendencies of parties that deviate from the documents of [the international communist and workers’ parties meeting in] 1969 [in Moscow]. It is anything but coincidence that after the 1969 Moscow meeting certain parties have paid visits to the DPRK (Sweden, Spain, Norway, Italy, Reunion).In its relations with the parties of capitalist countries the KWP leaders aim at, in our opinion, influencing these parties according to KWP policy and using them as a vehicle to establish diplomatic relations. We must pay close attention—and this is a dangerous phenomenon—that the KWP might establish relations with pro-Chinese splittist groups. For the first time ever, a congratulatory telegram to the KWP was published by the Communist Party of Thailand, which is completely in sync with Chinese positions.An important vehicle to increase influence abroad is the propagation of Kim Il Sung ideas through dissemination of his works and the founding of circles. Recent observations show that more attention is paid to those circles. They attempt to include communists in them in order to create permanent organizations. The Korean leadership tries to gain increasing ground through ideological infiltration into the international communist and anti-imperialist movement. There are ever more publications of congratulatory telegrams to Kim Il Sung with praises of his personality. Those congratulatory telegrams and messages cannot hide their Korean authors. Among other things, they want to manipulate the Korean people into believing that the entire world is studying the works of Kim Il Sung.The slide of the Korean leadership into the nationalist Juche ideology, the proclamation of this ideology’s universal character, and its dissemination abroad, creates an ever growing danger for the socialist community of states and the communist world movement. It requires us to pay increasing attention and to hold consultations between our parties how to approach and deal with these KWP activities.I thanked Comrade Kurbatov for his statements and expressed that we are in agreement about the assessment of KWP activities in the International Communist Movement.NoteA public demonstration of DPRK-PRC relations are facts like how the PRC Embassy in France organized a friendship meeting when on 25 February the DPRK “Mansudae” Ensemble visited France (telegram of 29 February 1972). When the ensemble arrived in Geneva on 8 March, it was welcomed at the train station by, among others, the Chinese Ambassador to Switzerland and employees of the Chinese Embassy. In the evening of the same day the Chinese side hosted a reception in Geneva in honor of the ensemble (telegram of 10 March 1972).60th Birthday of Kim Il Sung on 15 AprilAt the end of our conversation, Comrade Kurbatov asked whether the GDR will give a present to Kim Il Sung or wants to award him an order. This is a very problematic question and the [Soviet] embassy has so far not reached a result in its discussions. Here I remarked that so far I only know that we are preparing a congratulatory letter. My personal opinion: A present should have symbolic character, if a present will indeed have to be given.Comrade Gensicke, attaché of our Embassy, also attended this conversation.MertenActing AmbassadorCC1x Far East Department [Foreign Ministry]1x Central Committee, Department IV1x ZID [Foreign Ministry Central Information Service]1x Embassy, Political Department\n",

      "보고1972년 3월 10일 독일민주공화국 대사관에서 이루어진 소련 대사관 1등 서기관 쿠르바토프 동지와의 면담 내용다음의 질문사항에 대해 의견 교환이 진행되었음:닉슨의 베이징 방문과 이것이 한국 상황에 미치는 영향에 대한 북조선(DPRK)의 입장서면 원고에 의하면, 쿠르바토프 동지는 최근 중국과 미국간의 [상하이] 코뮤니케에 한국 문제가 언급되었다는 점에 대해 북조선 지도층이 특히 만족하고 있음을 그들의 반응을 통해 알 수 있다고 주장하였다. 북조선 지도층은 북조선의 8도 제안과 언커크[1]의 해체를 요청한 그들의 제안이 수용되었다는 점에서 매우 만족하였다. 북조선 지도층은 중국이 북조선에 대해 견고한 지지의 입장을 표명하였다고 생각한다. 로동신문은 북조선 지도층이 이번 사건을 “우애의 중국인민”이 보여준 지지로 받아들이고 있다고 적었다. 실제 닉슨의 베이징 체류기간 중, 북조선측은 1971년 8월 6일 김일성의 연설문에 명시되어 있는 자신의 입장을 전달하기도 했다. 닉슨은 베이징에 승리자가 아닌 패배자로 도착하게 될 것이다. 이와 같은 북조선의 입장은 [1972년 1월]  [일본 신문]인 요미우리 신문에 실린 [김일성]의 인터뷰에도 반복되어 나타나고 있다. 닉슨의 방문은 미국 대통령에게 가해진 외압으로 성사된 것으로 해석되었다. 이런 방법으로 북조선은 중국의 정책을 지지하고 회담에서 북조선에 대한 질문들을 논의하는데 동의한 것이다.북조선 지도부는 인쇄자료에서 중국과 미국이 공통된 이해관계를 가지고 있음을 그들의 인민들로부터 은폐하였다. 그들은 민족주의 노선을 취하며 미국과 중국 지도부가 반-소련 주의를 계기로 화해의 움직임을 보인다는 것을 간과하고 있었다. 북조선 지도부는 중국이 “사회주의 권력자”이고 “프롤레타리아 국제주의의 견고한 기반을 갖추고 있다”고 확신하고 있었기 때문이다. 북조선 지도부의 입장은 전적으로 실용주의 노선 위에 있다. 소련 및 다른 공산주의 국가들에 대한 그들의 정책에서도 철저한 실용주의적 노선 비중이 계속해서 증가하는 것을 찾아볼 수 있다. 그들은 중국의 지원하에 한반도의 통일을 이루기를 열망한다. 닉슨과의 대화를 준비하는 과정에서 중국의 지도부가 한반도내의 긴장상황(예를 들어 남한의 국가 비상사태 선포에 대해)에 대해 큰 흥미가 없었다는 점이 명백해졌다. 중국 측은 북조선의 지도층으로 하여금 그들의 완고한 입장으로부터 변화시키는데 성공하였다. 베이징 대화에서 한국에 대한 질문을 포함시킨 것은, 그것이 북조선의 온전한 인지 하에 이루어지긴 하였지만, 결론적으로 북조선과 중국간 관계에 새로운 요인으로 등장하였으며 중국 지도층이 북조선에 대해 가지고 있는 정책적 입장에 또 하나의 관점을 더하게 되었다. 중국은 한국 문제를 자신들의 손으로 해결하기를 원했던 것이다.김일성의 베이징 방문은 – 공식적으로 알려진 바에 따르면 2월초에 이루어 지지는 않았으나 – 닉슨과의 대화에 나타난 북조선 관련 질문으로 북조선과의 정확한 연대지점을 확고히 하고자 하는 목적을 이루게 되었다. 북조선 방문단은 베이징에서 중국 측과 가까이 머무르면서 정기적으로 접촉하였으며 이는 양국간의 공조관계가 보다 안정되었음을 보여준다. 북조선 측은 김일성의 베이징 방문을 부인하고 있다. 반면 중국 측은 이러한 사실을 특별히 부인하지는 않았으나, 양국간의 교류가 충분히 가능한 것이며, 이와 같은 방문이 특별한 일이 아님을 언급하였다. 이에 따라 북조선과 중국 측은 닉슨의 방문과 관련하여 의견교환이 있었음을 어렵지 않게 추측해볼 수 있다. 로동신문 3월 4일자 사설은 이를 함의하고 있는 듯 하다. 이러한 맥락 하에 북조선이 남한에서 미군을 축출해내기 위해 유리한 여건을 조성하기 위한 단계적 조치를 밟아나갈 것이라는 점을 추측해 볼 수 있다. 북조선 지도부는 바로 이 점을 가까운 미래에 달성할 주요 목표로 보고 있다. 북조선이 지속적으로 닉슨과의 협상과정과 관련된 기밀자료를 전달 받았다는 정보가 존재한다. 베이징에서 양국간의 대화를 통해 분명해진 점은 중국과 미국은 공동의 이해관계를 가지고 있으며, 소련의 개입 없이 아시아 및 다른 문제들을 해결하고자 하는 의지를 확인했다는 점이다. 그[쿠르바토프]는 또한 닉슨의 방문에 대해 북조선과 베트남민주공화국이 서로 다르게 평가하고 있다는 점을 또한 지적하였다.나는 쿠르바토프 동지의 발표에 대해 감사 인사를 전하고 닉슨 방문에 대한 우리 대사관의 평가를 다시 전달하였다.참고: 중국과 미국의 [상하이] 코뮤니케의 내용과 북조선에서 발표한 내용을 비교해보면 몇가지 생략된 부분을 제외하고는 거의 누락된 내용 없이 대화가 원문 그대로 기록되었음을 알 수 있다. 누락된 사항은 첫번째 문단의 마지막 문장과 세번째, 마지막 문단의 “대한민국”이라는 단어이다.브레즈네프 동지와 허담 외무상의 모스코바 회담 쿠르마토프 동지는 허담 동지가 쿠르마토프 동지에게 북조선이 앞으로 일본에 대해 새로운 입장을 취하게 될 것이라고 전했다고 강조하였다. 여기에는 북조선에 대한 일본의 태도 변화가 새로운 요인으로 작용한 것으로 보인다. 브레즈네프 동지와 나누었던 대화의 또 다른 측면은 허담 동지가 유엔에 대해 언급한 부분이었다. 허담 동지가 전한 바에 의하면, 북조선은 소련과 다른 사회주의 국가들이 유엔에서 자신의 입장을 지지하고 방어해주기를 원하고 있다. 북조선은 중화인민공화국 역시 마찬가지로 북조선을 지지하고 나서주기를 기대하고 있다. 허담 동지는 나아가 유엔 내의 모든 사회주의 국가들이 중국과 같이 모두 합의되고 일치된 방법으로 행동하기를 낙관하는 입장을 계속해서 표명하였다.[소련과 북조선이 방문에 대해 나눈] “공동 성명”에는 일본과 유엔에 대한 현안은 포함되지 않았다. 브레즈네프 동지는 일본에 대한 발표문을 듣고 유엔에 대한 사항은 면밀한 검토가 필요한 부분이라고 지적하였다.쿠르마토프 동지는 나아가 현재 소련은 북측에 대한 남측의 공격을 배제하고 있음을 언급하였다. 허담은 북조선과 중국 간의 관계에 있어서 개선의 여지를 보았는데, 북조선이 소련 혹은 다른 사회주의국가와의 관계를 대가로 치르지 않으면서 이것을 이룩할 수 있는 가능성에 대해 이야기하였다. 나아가 허담은 [브레즈네프]와 나눈 대담에서 북조선이 소련 동지들과의 대화에서 표명한 입장을 중국에게 온전히 전달하겠노라고 언급하였다. 상당히 중요한 질문이었음에도 불구하고, [브레즈네프-허담]간의 고위급 면담에서 정당간 관계 [조선로동당-소련공산당]에 대한 [북조선-소련] 양국간의 협의는 이루어지지 않았다. 향후 수다리코프 대사는 허담의 방문에 대해 보다 자세히 전할 예정이다.공산주의 세계운동에서 조선로동당 활동에 대한 일부 관점들서면 원고에 의거하여, 쿠르마토프 동지는 아래와 같은 의견을 남겼다:1971년과 1972년, 조선로동당은 공산당과 노동당과의 관계를 지속해나갔다. 여러 정당의 정당대회에 참가하였고 대표부와의 교류에도 참여하였다. 그는 북조선으로 여러 정당들의 대표부를 초청하기도 하였다. 이전과 마찬가지로, 조선로동당은 정당과의 관계를 양자간의 교류를 기반으로 구축하였으며, 다자간의 협력관계에는 소극적이였다. 그들은 주체사상을 포괄적인 시스템으로 구축해 나가기 위한 노력을 더해 나갔으며, 김일성의 주체사상을 정당 활동의 유일한 사상기반이라고 선언하였다. 다섯번째 당대회는 공산주의의 발전과 모순되었지만 프티 부르주아(소시민)와 민족주의자들 사이로 뻗어나갔다. 이러한 민족주의적 경향과 중국과의 관계 강화는 공산주의 운동 및 조선로동당이 공산주의 및 사회주의 운동과 갖는 관계에도 부정적인 경향을 증폭시켰다. 조선로동당이 마르크스-레닌주의를 기반으로 개별 정당들과 관계를 구축하는 것이 필요함을 공식적으로 선언하였음에도 불구하고, 국제 공산주의 운동의 활동가들에 의해 조선로동당은 스스로 마르크스-레닌주의와 민족주의적 주체사상 간의 모순을 형성하고, 프롤레타리아 국제주의는 “자주”와 “독립”과 모순을 초래하였다.조선로동당 지도부는 공산주의 세계 운동에서의 경험을 인정하지 않고, 동료 정당들이 집단적으로 내린 결정들에 따르지도 않았다. 대신 그들은 김일성을 공산주의와 로동운동의 저명한 지도자로 추대하고 그를 혁명의 귀재로 찬양하였다. 조선로동당은 김일성이 “현재 국제 정세의 특징에 대한 현명한 분석을 제공”한 그의 업적을 자체 방침으로 삼았다. 그들에게 김일성은 “반제국주의적 힘에 대항하는 지도자”였으며, 김일성의 사상은 “제국주의의 종말을 가속화하고 전세계적 혁명을 승리로 이끄는” 힘이였다. 김일성의 업적과 해외 관료들과의 내부 회의에서 남겼던 그의 어록, 그리고 공식적으로 출판된 그의 연설문들에 의하면 김일성은 소련과 동료 공산주의 국가들에서 이룩한 공산주의와 사회주의의 건립과 그 성공에 대해 부정적인 의견과 입장을 취하고 있었다는 추측을 해볼 수 있다. 명시적으로 그는 북조선이 사회주의 이념을 구축해나가는 길을 “유일하게 정당하고 다른 국가들에게 모범적인” 것으로 보았다. 예를 들어, 스웨덴 공산주의 극좌 정당 대표단이 북조선에 방문하여 함께 대화를 나누었을 때 그는 소련공산당의 인민 국가 개발방안은 프롤레타리아 독재의 약화를 가져올 것이기 때문에 동의하지 않는다는 입장을 표명한바 있다.[조선로동당] 중앙위원회의 [국제] 4부의 부부장인 김영남은 김일성이 했던 말을 빌려 “공산주의가 종국적으로 범지구적으로 구축되기 이전까지는, 프롤레타리아가 권력을 쟁취한 개별 국가들은 국제 자본에 의한 제국주의의 침략과 자본주의의 부활의 위험을 좌시하지 않을 수 없을 것이다”라고 말했다.김일성의 이념을 기반으로, 북조선의 선전은 현재 모든 정당들을 개인숭배, 프롤레타리아 독재, 계급투쟁 등과 같은 질문들에 대해 김일성의 입장과 동의하지 않는 수정주의의 지지 세력으로 규명하고 있다. 이러한 맥락에서 몇몇 사회주의 국가 대사관들은 북조선 내에서 왜곡된 ‘반-소련’정서가 발전할 것이라는 결론에 이르렀다. 이상의 사안들이 모두 논의되고 고려된바, 북조선 지도부가 표방하고 있는 통일과 공산주의 운동에 대한 친밀감은 본질적으로 선언적이며, 정직하지 못하며, 실용적 수단으로도 입증되지 못하였다. 이러한 경향은 조선로동당의 지도부가 전세계 공산주의 운동의 통합 보다는 이른바 아시아의 혁명적 인민통일전선으로 그 핵심(북조선, 중국, 베트남, 캄보디아, 라오스)을 구성하고 있음을 어느 때보다 분명하게 나타냈다. 이러한 접근 방식은 프롤레타리아 국제주의의 계급적 지위에서 점차 멀어져 실용적 입장인 민족주의 노선으로 전환되고 있음을 증명한다. 이러한 맥락에서 북조선 내부의 선전은 “사회주의 국가들은 혁명의 정신을 잃었으며, 따라서 이들은 현재 혁명적인 사람들이 투쟁하는 물질적인 기반만을 마련해줄 수 있을 뿐이다”라는 주장을 펼치기 시작했다. 로동신문의 기사에는 이러한 대중 선전이 다소 수정된 형태로 나타나 “프롤레타리아 독재와 프롤레타리아 민주주의를 지켜내자”라고 등장했다.혁명 국가들 중에서 이데올로기와 정치적으로 인접한 위치[북조선과 중국간 거리]를 바탕으로 조선로동당은 중국에 큰 신뢰를 가지고 있는데, 이로 미루어, 조선로동당은 중국과 정당간의 관계를 강화하기 위해 노력하고 있다는 결론을 내릴 수 있었다. 1971년 이래로 그들은 정당간 대표부 교류를 지속해왔다. 북조선의 선전은 중국 공산당의 이른바 9차 당대회의 “투쟁의 과업”을 환영하였으며, 소위 “문화 혁명”의 이행도 반겼다. 로동신문의 기사는 중국 공산당 50주년 기념일에  “문화혁명 이후, 중국공산당이 더욱 순수하고 강철같이 강한 정당이 되었다”라고 언급하며 축하하였다.조선로동당은 중국과 계속해서 연락망을 구축하고 정보 교류책을 조직하였다. 북조선에서는 중국 신문인 홍치가 계속해서 유통되고 있다. 조선로동당 지도부는 자신들의 목표를 추구하는 과정에서 중국 외교정책의 반-소련 경향에 주의를 기울이지 않았다. 당시 수단, 인도/파키스탄, 중동에서의 특정 사건들과 관련해 나타난 바와 같이, 그들은 중국과 보다 가까운 입장을 취했다.최근 조선로동당은 알바니아 로동당과의 관계를 부쩍 활성화시켰다. 현재까지 북조선의 노력은 그들이 원하는 알바니아의 반응을 이끌어내지 못하였으며, 정부 수준에서 양국간의 관계를 작동시킨 것에 불과했다. 몇몇 중요한 기념 행사의 경우 그들은 전통과 우애의 관계를 강조하는 축하 메세지를 주고 받았다. 양국 관계의 가장 큰 발전은 루마니아 공산당이 민족주의의 기반 하에서 정당의 “자주”와 “독립”을 주창하였던 데에 있다. 조선로동당과 루마니아 공산당과의 교류는 1971년부터 양측간의 합의에 의하여 진행되었다.1971년 조선로동당이 형제정당(불가리아, 체코슬로바키아, 몽골리아, 독일공산당, 폴란드, 소련)의 정당대회에 참여하였다는 사실이 양 정당간의 관계 개선을 가져온 것은 아니다. 조선로동당의 지도부는 이와 같은 모임을 세계 공산주의 운동의 선두에서 자신들이 점유하고 있는 특별한 위치를 선전하기 위한 연단으로 활용하였으며, 특히 양 정당간 관계에서 “자주”와 “독립”을 강조하는 기회가 되었다. 조선로동당 지도부는 형제정당과의 경험 및 기존의 대표단 교류방식에서 탈피하고 있다. 예를 들어, 양국간의 관련 협정에도 불구하고 1971년에는 해당 국가로 휴가를 떠난 당원이 전무했다. 조선로동당의 지도부는 1979년 [모스크바]에서 [국제 공산당 노동당 회의]에서 도출된 협정에서 벗어나는 정당들의 경향을 예의주시하였다. 1969년 모스크바 회의에서 일부 정당들(스웨덴, 스페인, 노르웨이, 이탈리아, 레위니옹)이 북조선으로의 방문을 추진했던 점은 어디까지나 우연에 불과하였다.우리의 의견에 의하면, 자본주의 국가내 정당들과의 관계에 있어서 조선로동당의 지도부는 조선로동당의 정책에 의거하여 영향력을 행사하고 외교적 관계를 맺기 위한 수단으로 그들을 사용하려 했던 것으로 보인다. 우리는 이러한 점을 주의하여 관찰해야 하며 – 이것은 위험한 현상이다 – 조선로동당이 친-중국 분리주의 집단들과 관계를 구축하려고 시도할 수도 있음을 주목해야 한다. 처음으로 태국의 공산당에서는 조선로동당에게 축하전보를 발송하였으며, 이는 중국의 입장과 정확히 일치하는 부분이다.외국에서의 영향력을 강화하기 위한 가장 중요한 수단은 김일성이 이룩한 그의 근본 사상과 업적을 전파하고 선전하는 작업이다.  최근 그의 사상적 동지들에게 더 큰 이목이 집중되고 있다는 특징이 발견된다. 그들은 공산주의자들을 포섭하여 집단을 보다 견고한 조직으로 만들려 시도하였다. 북조선 지도부는 국제 공산주의와 반-제국주의 조직 속으로 이데올로기를 투영시켜 토대를 보다 견고히 다지고자 하였다. 지금은 과거 그 어느때보다 김일성과 그의 성품을 찬양하는 전보가 많아지고 있다. 조선인들이 이와 같은 축하 전보와 메시지의 배후에 있는 사실은 숨겨지지 않는다. 다른 것들과 마찬가지로, 그들은 전세계가 김일성의 업적에 대해 연구하고 있음을 북조선 사람들이 믿도록 조작하고자 한다.국가주의적 주체 사상에 몰두한 북조선 지도부는 이데올로기의 국제 보편적 성격과 해외로의 전파를 통해 국제 공산주의 세계 운동이 일어나고 있는 공산국들에게 전례없는 위험을 양산하고 있다. 이는 보다 면밀한 우리의 주의를 요하며, 조선로동당의 활동에 대해 우리가 어떻게 접근하고 대응해야 하는가에 관해 우리 정당들간 상의해야할 필요성을 높이고 있다.나는 쿠르바토프 동지에게 그가 전해준 이야기에 대해 감사를 표했고, 국제 공산주의 운동에서 조선로동당의 활동에 대한 분석에 대해 동의하고 있음을 밝혔다.주석북-중 관계가 대중에 공식적으로 노출된 부분은 프랑스 주재 중국대사관이 2월 25일

      "Tibor Méray:Germ WarfareMemories and Reflections[1]The aim of this workshop is to analyze new evidence on the Korean War and to examine unanswered questions. Being a writer rather than a scholar, I would like to start on a personal note. It may sound strange but, personally and subjectively, the first and foremost question that remains unanswered for me, even today, is this: Why was it I who became entangled in this Korea story?Let me begin at the beginning. I graduated from the Budapest University in September 1946, majoring in Hungarian and Latin literature. Next day I was married and on the following day I took up employment in the editorial office of the central daily of the Communist Party, Szabad Nép (Free People). For a year I was learning the profession, then in the fall of 1947, at the age of twenty- three, I was appointed editor of the cultural section of the newspaper. From that point onward I was kept busy with cultural topics, theatre, cinema, literature, music, fine arts, and education. At the same time I also wrote a few film scripts.On the afternoon of July 21, 1951 the telephone rang on my desk. You can imagine how surprised I was when the head of the party's AGITPROP, who was previously my Editor-in-Chief, asked me what opinion I had of Kaesong. I gave a vague answer—until then I had no dealings with foreign politics, my work kept me busy for fourteen to sixteen hours a day and, at the most, I might have glanced over the headlines of articles that were about foreign affairs. I probably said something like \"It is an important place.\" The reply was as follows: \"The reason why I have asked you is because you have to go there on the first available plane. You will be sending reports about the armistice talks.\"The shock left me breathless. Until then I had only been abroad twice, to neighbouring Czechoslovakia to attend film festivals. No Hungarian correspondent had ever been to Korea, and, by the way, not even to the People's Republic of China which at that time was not quite two years old.If I may quote what the great statesman, Winston Churchill, said of Korea in 1953: \"I'd never heard of the bloody place until I was seventy-four.\" Well, at that time I was twenty-seven. (I would like to ask the Korean participants who are present here: please do not be offended! They or their parents would have heard almost nothing about Hungary until 1956. Small countries are condemned to the fate that only wars, revolutions and natural disasters make them known in the world)I had to prepare for the trip in a great hurry. My weatherproof coat was worn out and I had no time to buy a new one. I planned to buy one in Moscow while waiting for the connecting flight to Beijing. After my arrival there I went to the famous GUM department store. A staff member of the Hungarian Embassy came with me since I did not know Russian. They had suitable coats in the store but there were hundreds of people lining up to buy one. This was not quite as I had imagined the country of \"achieved socialism\". However, the person who came with me told the people in the line that I was on the way to Korea so they let me go ahead of them. I was witness to the fact that in the Soviet bloc the name “Korea” was some sort of a magic word.Half a century has gone by since this, and I have been through many things. I have found answers to many questions and have not found answers to many others. For instance, I now know that it was the North Koreans who asked the European communist countries to send correspondents to Kaesong so they could show the UN correspondents that there were Europeans on their side, too. The one thing that I will never understand until my dying day: why, in Hungary, was it I who became the \"chosen one\"?I have to admit that my introduction is not altogether innocent. The organizers of today's workshop, Mrs. Kathryn Weathersby and Mr. Christian Ostermann asked me to talk about the germ warfare. (Tomorrow, at the Korea Society's conference, I will talk about my other Korean experiences) Well, in the telling of the story of my departure to Korea I would like to show what an inexperienced, green person I was when I wrote about the germ warfare. I was not conversant with international politics and was even less knowledgeable about issues such as warfare related to bacteria. This may sound like a preliminary apology. Well, it is!On the other hand, I can give an exact account of how I became involved in the germ warfare issue. I was in Kaesong on February 22, 1952 when the Foreign Minister of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea stated that from January 28, the American interventionist army had started germ warfare against the Korean People's Army, the Chinese volunteers and the peaceful Korean population, in order to cause mass destruction. This statement was confirmed two days later by the Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China, Zhou Enlai.I was horrified. This was an astounding announcement. At the same time I did not see that it had anything to do with me as a correspondent, after all I had been sent to cover the armistice negotiations at Kaesong (by then at Panmunjom).A week later I received a telegram from my editorial office. It contained a question that was meant to be a reproach. How is it possible that I am sitting in Kaesong where nothing is happening when the whole world is buzzing with news about germ warfare?On March 2 I travelled from Kaesong to Pyongyang. I will give you a brief account what I saw and heard in the North. In a half-ruined building that housed the Ministry of Health I spoke with the Deputy Minister then with the Minister himself. They told me in detail how the Americans were waging germ warfare. The Minister showed me a map of North Korea which had twenty two red circles on it: these were the places where, up until that day, germ warfare attacks had been made—mainly along the front and on the Western half of the country.A number of scientists also participated in the conversation. They led me into a nearby laboratory. Countless bottles and boxes were there, in them were hundreds or thousands of various insects. They said that peasants, village communal committees, health groups and soldiers had sent the insects there.They stood me behind a microscope and showed me all sorts of preparations. They stated that these had been obtained from flies, fleas, centipedes and fish that American planes had dropped. They added that the strange oval-shaped creatures that I was looking at were cholera bacteria. They also showed plague bacilli. They remarked that not 'all insects and fish were contaminated—this was part of the American trickery. The Americans wanted to create the impression that the emergence of these insects in winter was a natural phenomenon.All this impressed me. Still, I said that I would like to see a germ attack in real life, rather than insects in a laboratory.I did not have long to wait. A few days later they took me to look at something on the spot in a little village called Sono-ri. The village people related that on the night before February 28 A11ierican planes circled above the village, for a long time and at a low altitude, without dropping bombs. Next morning a peasant found eight small heaps of flies on the ice of the Daedong River. They were alive, crawling and flying about and they soon spread over an area of several hundred meters. The inhabitants of the village spent four days exterminating them by burning dry wood and com husks.They took me to the river. There were black stripes on the white ice, marks of a bonfire. I did not see any sign of life. I was probably at the twentieth such place when I noticed moving spots. They were hundreds of flies. They were alive and were crawling on the ice, slowly staggering. At one place the sunshine had melted the ice into a puddle. About six or eight flies were swimming in the dirty water. This happened ten days after the peasant mentioned above found them.The Central Laboratory in Pyongyang showed that the flies were contaminated by cholera. I asked how the flies remained alive in temperatures of minus 5 to minus 10 degrees Celsius. They told me that these flies were a special strain that were bred especially for the purpose of germ warfare. They also explained to me why the flies were dropped in Sono-ri. The Daedong [Taedong] River flows from Sono-ri toward Pyongyang. The waterworks of the capital was located between Sono-ri and Pyongyang. Therefore if the drinking water were to be infected at Sono-ri then the drinking water of Pyongyang would be also infected. It would cause mass death.Another shocking experience was in store for me, two or three days later in Pyongyang. They took me to the central district of the capital, to Building No.6 in Street Number 2 of Namnun-ri District. Before this I received a cholera immunization. I had to put on a rubber outfit from head to toe, trousers up to my chest, a jacket with a hood which went right down to my eyes, long black boots and long gloves. They tied a white operating theater gown over my rubber suit and a surgical face-mask over my nose and mouth.A thick seagrass rope was around the block of houses where we went and armed sentries stood next to the rope. No one was allowed to enter or leave this area without special permission.At this place a grieving couple told me that on the night before March 5 American planes dropped five small piles of flies that fell in their courtyard. Near to them were oblong-shaped white envelopes and South Korean leaflets. The couple set off to work early morning while it was still dark. The flies were found by their two children, one aged six, the other aged two and their sixty eight year old grandfather. Although the grandfather was cautious about the insects, somehow they still touched them. Next day they became ill and died. A laboratory test showed that the flies were infected with cholera.This is as much as I can relate about my personal experiences. I saw what I saw. Whatever I heard as an explanation I believed and wrote down. What happened to me was exactly the same as happened later to members of the International Scientific Commission who investigated the germ warfare in Korea and who were much more experienced and better qualified than I was. I believed because I wanted to believe. I trusted those who gave me the so-called scientific information just as this Commission did. A member of the Commission stated: \"We felt so sure of the integrity of our Chinese hosts that we entirely trusted statements which they made regarding American use of germ warfare. The scientific foundation of the Commission's work consisted of the fact that the delegates implicitly believed the Chinese and North Korean accusations and evidence.\"I have to say that my belief was shaken not by Korea but by events in Hungary. Not long after my return to Hungary I realized the extent of the crimes of Stalinism that had been committed in my country and the mass of lies that covered these crimes. At this stage simple logic led me to the history of the Korean War. I asked myself whether they had told me the truth about many things, including the germ warfare. I knew the similarity between the two regimes. The parallel caused me to be filled with doubts. However, in Budapest, I was unable to get at the proof.I fled to the West after the 1956 Revolution. The Voice of America radio station sought me out virtually in the first moment, while I was still in Vienna. They asked me to issue a statement saying that the germ warfare was a lie. I replied that I could not say that I did not see what I saw. The most I could do was to have doubts about the explanations of what I saw. However, until I was able to substantiate my doubts I was unable to speak. \"So you still believe in it?\" was the rather aggressive question. \"I have written and talked for too long about something based on belief. Now I want to find facts,\" was my reply.Only science could provide help to find answers to my doubts. Early in 1957, after I arrived in Paris, I sought out the specialist scientists who were considered the best in France: the director of the Pasteur Institute, the head of the cholera section of the same Institute who was the director of the International Institute of Epidemiology, the head of the Entomology Institute, the head of the Bacteriological Department of the University of Medicine and the best known biologist in the country who was also a member of the French Academy. I told them in detail everything that I had seen and heard in Korea. All these meetings lasted several hours and they listened to me with great patience.I gave an account of their replies in a series of articles in a daily called Franc-Tireur in May 1957. There is not enough time to talk here in detail about these articles. I only wish to outline the opinions quoted in them. The French scientists all acknowledged that the campaign aimed at the general public was very cleverly orchestrated as far as propaganda was concerned. While I was relating my experiences to the biology professor Jean Rostand, the member of the French Academy, at one stage he interrupted me saying: \"If you keep on with this story even I will believe it!\"At the same time they all found details that were absurd from a scientific point of view. There were such factual errors as made the entire concept unacceptable. One of the scientists pointed out the fragility of the vibrio, or Asiatic cholera bacterium. In temperatures of minus five to minus ten degrees it is impossible to spread an epidemic with this vibrio. According to the opinion of the director of the Pasteur Institute it would be possible to infect a smaller group, for instance, the General Staff, but on a country-wide scale it would be hazardous even to those who employed this warfare. The opinion of the cholera-specialist director of the Epidemic Prevention division of the Pasteur Institute was that the immunization that I received immediately before I visited a house in the Namnun-ri district in Pyongyang was worthless. Two injections are required against cholera, seven days apart. First 4 billion units then the second time 8 billion. Furthermore, these immunizations become effective only five days after the second injection. The most direct statement was made by Professor Seguy, director of the Entomology Institute, who had studied flies for 45 years. \"Using flies in germ warfare is impossible\" he said. \"Flies can spread cholera where it already exists, transmitting it from infected feces. However, flies cannot hold the bacteria longer than half an hour. Also they cannot, for this purpose, be dropped from a height in paper envelopes. They would perish while falling down,\"I would like to add that the international prestige of Professor Seguy was such that the report of the International Commission for the Investigation of Facts Concerning Bacterial Warfare in Korea and China contained five references to his books. The professor knew this report, he had it in his library earlier on. However, when I visited him he did not have it any longer. \"It was all nonsense. I threw it out,\" he said.There was a common element in the view of the French scientists. This was evident in a series of questions rather than a statement. Was I present when the flies were dropped on Sono-ri? Did I see the planes actually dropping the flies? Did I see when the cholera bacteria were found? Was I present to the end during the laboratory examinations? Was I present when the insects were dropped on the courtyard in Pyongyang? Did I see who dropped them? Did I see when the old man and the children touched the insects? Was I present when the corpses were taken into the laboratory? And when samples were taken from them? And when they found cholera bacteria in the samples?Of course, these questions sounded somewhat rhetorical but, essentially, if anything could be substantiated in these accusations made by the North Koreans and the Chinese, it could only be verified if someone followed through every instance from the beginning right to the end.Incidentally, this was the point where the French professors’ interpretation coincided with that of the International Scientific Commission. The Commission's report drew up an ideal scheme, a complete series that, according to its members, would be a source of perfect evidence. This scheme starts with airplanes and then involves containers, the creatures that were dropped, the meteorological situation and bacteriological examinations right up to the establishment of the illness. The report notes at this place: \"Naturally, a complete series of proofs could only be found very rarely or never.\" The Commission itself never followed through such a series and never referred to an individual who would have done so. Thus the term \"very rarely\" evaporates from the Report and all that remains is the word \"never\". The Scientific Commission itself, with this fact, qualified the scientific value of its own Report.I would like to add to this, as an anecdote, that members of the Commission of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, who were also busily investigating the germ warfare in Korea, were taken to the Daedong River, the same place where I had been taken earlier. Where I saw flies, the Report of this Commission mentions “ant-like insects.” The laboratory that told me about cholera bacteria informed the Lawyers' Committee that they found \"bacteria which caused a disease of the intestines\". The two can be hardly the same. This is not all. This Committee was taken to Pyongyang, to House No.6 in Street No.2 in the Namnun-ri district, the same place where I had been earlier. The Committee's Report, regarding this inspection, reads as follows: \"In Pyongyang City (as mentioned above) two persons fell ill on March 6th and another on March 8th.  Two of them died on March 8th.\" You will remember that I was told that three persons died. I can only be glad that one remained alive out of the three, even though I will never know whether this fortunate third person was one of the children or their grandfather. I hope that in actual fact all three of them!When information gathered on the spot was so unreliable and scientific investigations did not substantiate anything, then, according to the simplest logic, we are talking about an invention. With very few exceptions, the opinion of the whole Western scientific community was similar to that of the French scientists. It is another matter that the campaign of hatred that was based on the propaganda of germ warfare was particularly effective in the West, more precisely, in Western Europe. As for the only positive outcome of this propaganda: it was an unimaginably thorough campaign for hygiene that I witnessed both in Korea and China. Due to time limits I am unable to go into details about this.A big question remains: Who invented the story about the germ warfare?I have to tell you straight away: I don't know the answer and as far as I know no one has been able to say with certainty who it was. I would like to attempt an exercise, using the method of elimination. I find it inconceivable that the campaign started \"from below\". I have seen many campaigns which started from below\": The Stakhanov system, the \"Socialist work competition\" offered for Stalin's seventieth birthday, the so-called \"Peace government bonds\" offered \"voluntarily\" to be deducted from wages. All these \"from below\" campaigns, which were started off with great enthusiasm, came into existence by reason of the Political Committee of the Conununist Party having decided it at the top.Could the leadership of the Korean communist party have been the initiator? Theoretically it could. More so because there is an unclear factor that up until this day remains to be solved. The accusation of germ warfare was first heard not in February 1952 but nine months earlier. On May 8th 1951, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea sent a cable to the President of the United Nations Security Council, stating that the US forces in Korea had used bacteriological weapons during the period of December 1950 to January 1951 and had spread smallpox. This accusation had been maintained for a few weeks then suddenly vanished—until February 1952. Therefore it was the North Koreans who came up first—just as in February 1952—with the topic of germ warfare. Why they became silent for several months is a mystery. However, it can be taken with certainty—if one knows the Soviet-North Korean relationship—that the North Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs could not have sent a cable such as this to the UN Security Council without Soviet permission or instigation. I think that North Korea can be eliminated from the initiators.Now the Chinese and the Russians are left. A Chinese initiation appears to be less likely in light of the North Korean cable in May 1951. Also making it less likely is that the first accusation was followed by a noncommittal attitude by the Chinese. This contrasted with the North Korean statement in February 1952 when only two days later Zhou Enlai also joined in protest, in the name of the Chinese government. In my opinion neither this second North Korean statement could have been made without Soviet permission or instigation, nor Zhou's protestation made without a preliminary harmonizing with the Kremlin. On the other hand, to support the theory of Chinese instigation I can quote a personal experience. As I have mentioned, I had talks with the deputy Minister for Health, then with the Minister for Health in Pyongyang in March 1952. The first meeting was on March 6th. The deputy minister then told me the following, literally: \"It was the Chinese volunteers who first informed us about the bacteriological attack when they reported that they had found unusual insects.\" Three days later, on March 9th, the minister asked me, that in any report I might write about this matter, to not mention Chinese volunteers but soldiers fighting on the front. This episode suggests that in February 1952 it was the Chinese who suggested to the Koreans to raise the charge of germ warfare.Even if we do not exclude the Chinese as the initiators of the 1952 germ warfare accusation the role of the Soviets still remains to be investigated.They are the most difficult to catch. As far as the Korean War was concerned, they made an effort to present themselves to the outside world as remaining in the background, or at least in the second or third row from the front. They supported the accusation of the germ warfare, echoed it, at home and also at international forums; they also supported the so-called investigating committees which were in fact dependent on them—but as if they had nothing to do with the whole affair. However, perhaps they were not as innocent as they chose to appear.In this propaganda campaign it was stated—and unfortunately it was true—that the American government had granted immunity to certain persons who, during the Japanese occupation of China, directed a program of biological warfare. They were General Shiro Ishii and several of his collaborators. The immunity they received was in exchange for information gathered from them. However, it is also true that several members of General Ishii's group became the Soviets' prisoners in Manchuria and twelve of them were tried by the Russians in December 1949 in Khabarovsk. Therefore the Russians had at their disposal, beside their own experimental results in germ warfare, material gained from the Japanese officers. This is an important factor because the North Koreans and the Chinese (who had been in power only for two years) were at that stage unlikely to be in possession of sufficient material to enable them to build up a charge of germ warfare, or to compose a 650 page document which was published by the International Scientific Commission—given that the science was mixed with pseudo-science. We can deduce from this that the Soviets were either the instigators or that they participated, right from the beginning, in formulating the charges—or perhaps they did both.There is another circumstance that is not without interest. I was still in Hungary in the spring of 1950 when the communist leadership raised a charge against the US, stating that they had wanted to ruin the country’s potato crop by using Colorado beetles. Similar accusations were heard in Czechoslovakia and Poland. It more than probable than these accusations originated from a central source, namely from Moscow. It was a fundamental factor in the whole Soviet AGITPROP mentality to make the West, and first of all the US responsible for difficulties encountered in any area whatsoever. Has the potato crop failed? This is because of the American Colorado beetles. There are difficulties with Tito? It is the Americans who stand behind Tito. Do they intend to make purges within the communist party? The Titoist conspirators must be unmasked, tried and executed and the Americans must be accused because they are the ones who direct their puppet, Tito. Is there a danger of epidemic breaking out in North Korea and China? Before the outbreak of an epidemic, or before the epidemic becomes widespread we must point an accusing finger at the Americans. This mentality at that time, in 1950, pervaded the young China much less than was the case with the Soviets. This is another indication that the idea to raise the accusation of germ warfare could have originated in Moscow.Finally something more. While I was writing my series of articles in Paris I unearthed two curious facts. In the joint sittings of the Soviet Communist (Bolshevik) Party's Central Committee and Central Control Committee, on January 7, 1933, Yosif Vissarionovich Stalin stated, in connection with the criminal activities of certain Soviet citizens: \"They organize wrecking activities in the collective and state farms and some of them, including certain professors, go to such lengths in their zeal to destroy as to inject the germs of plague and anthrax into cattle and on the collective farms they help spread meningitis among horses, etcetera\". In 1937-38, during the show trials an accused person confessed \"to manufacturing virulent bacteria in three separate factories in order to destroy herds of Soviet swine\". Another defendant admitted that \"he had connived with Japanese intelligence to infect the Red Army with highly virulent bacteria in the event of war\".Stalin, therefore, had an old and favorite idea: the accusation of germ warfare. As far as I know he was the first politician in the world who formulated these kinds of charges, pre-dating the North Koreans and Chinese by more than ten years. I do not consider impossible that it was the same Stalin who remembered this idea during the Korean War.All these are, naturally, presumptions. Fifty years have gone by but I do not know of anyone who has found irrefutable evidence. It is a grotesque situation that while we are searching our minds the solution is perfectly simple. It would be sufficient for a safe to be opened in Moscow or Beijing and we would know everything. Few secrets have been revealed in Beijing but many in Moscow. However, these revelations have been, without exception, in connection with internal affairs, party-matters of the Communist bloc; after all, conflicts with Belgrade or Beijing can also be traced back to the internal affairs of the relevant communist parties. Gorbachev may come, Yeltsin, too, Putin after him, but in the realm of foreign policy the Kremlin does not reveal many secrets. Why? How can we interpret this in any other way than that Russia continues to accept the legacy of the foreign policy of the Soviet Union, with all its faults and crimes? Asking this question and establishing this fact causes one to think and suggests a prospect rather disquieting to contemplate!(Translated by Christine and William Hyde)[1] An amended version of Tibor Méray’s reflections was published in The Korea Society Quarterly 3 (Fall 2000): 10-11, 44-45.\n",

      "Tibor Méray:“The Truth about Germ Warfare”[A series of twelve articles published by the Parisian daily Franc-Tireur between6th and 19th May, 1957.][Translated from French by: Marlya Ridgwell, August 1988.]1. I must rid myself of a burden which for some years has been weighing upon my conscience. No compulsion from the outside, no menace or pleadings, no promises have obliged me to speak. It is my conscience which demands that I write these articles, so as to throw off this burden and thus find peace.I do not wish to indulge in stylistic effects. I will try to be as matter of fact and as concise as I can. I will try to be as precise and objective as possible. Above all, I do not wish to give way to any passions. On the contrary, it is the calming of passions that I desire and wish to serve. And if anyone thinks that I am acting without indulgence, then I will tell him that my first thought has been not to be lenient towards myself.In the fight which we have undertaken for the freedom of Hungary, our country, and for true progress, my colleagues and fellow writers and myself, have vowed to serve truth only. And today also I do seek nothing but the truth. No side glances either to the right or to the left. It is the bare truth only that I will consider.-----On the 21st July 1951, at about two o'clock in the afternoon, the telephone rang in my office at the “Szabad Nép,” central newspaper of the Hungarian Workers (Communist) Party. It was Márton Horváth, member of the Political Bureau, director of “Agitprop” of the Central Committee of the party. “What do you make of Gaesong [Kaesong]?” he asked me point-blank.At first I did not understand what he meant.“Of what?”“Gaesong, surely.”I got the message. For the past few days, some armistice negotiations were taking place in that particular town in Korea.“IMPORTANT, SURELY,” I mumbled not quite discerning yet the drift of my caller.“Well then,” said Horvath, “you will take the first available plane to the Far East and you will go to Gaesong…You will send us reports on the armistice negotiations.”I caught my breath. Until then I had been editing the cultural column of “Szabad Nép.” Why was I chosen rather than anyone else? Márton Horváth explained: “Well, we think you have good eyes and a way with your pen. Keep your eyes open and use your pen with courage…”A little later on Horváth came to see me at my office. I asked him if he had any instructions for me.“No,” he replied. “Nothing special.”He was that brand of intellectual who does not go in for flowery speech, at least not on informal occasions. But he changed his mind. Maybe he thought that he could. Not let me leave without some explanatory words, and so he added: “See to it that the Hungarian people get the feel, the growing hate for the Korean people and the growing hate towards the American invader…”The days preceding my departure were spent in feverish activity. The excitement of my imminent departure and the honor which I had bestowed upon me (I was the first Hungarian journalist to leave for Korea or even to leave for the Far East) were making me quite dizzy. I must admit that I knew very little of the problems of war in Korea. I had learned, like everyone else in Hungary that THE AMERICANS HAD ATTACKED NORTH KOREA, THAT THE.NOR.TH KOREANS HAD FOUGHT BACK, UPON WHICH THE AMERICANS HAD THROWN IMPORTANT FORCES INTO ACTION AND THEN THE CHINESE VOLUNTARY FORCES HAD REPELLED THIS NEW AGGRESSION…On the eve of my departure, at the request of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, I paid a visit to the Korean Minister in Budapest. In the course of our conversation the latter confided to me that the First Secretary of the Hungarian Workers Party, Mátyás Rákosi, had informed him personally of my imminent departure. This revelation made me even more aware of the importance of my mission. He then talked to me about the situation in Korea: of the climate, the cuisine and especially of the difficulties which awaited me there.“In our country,” he said, referring to the sedentary nature of my journalism which was mainly concerned with artistic and literary matters, “it is not sufficient to know however thoroughly the Marxist-Leninist doctrines. You must also be brave. Your mission will most certainly not be a joy-ride.”He was thinking of American bombings. He was right. I was going to spend fourteen months in Korea without feeling for one single hour any sense of security. That surely was no pleasure trip. My jeep was peppered with bullets some twenty or thirty times. I have had to shelter in corn fields, in waterlogged rice fields, behind little piles of brick and put up with the air raids like everyone else. And yet the thought of shortening my stay had not crossed my mind. I had the feeling that I was serving a just cause and I put all I had into it. I sent back more than one hundred reports and wrote three books on Korea. I wrote about the fighting at the front and I wrote about the armistice negotiations. I wrote about the suffering of the Korean people, of the terror of air raids, about the heroism of simple people. I wrote about the prisoners of war, about international solidarity and the international conspiracy. And also about the germ warfare.All this seemed to me quite clear and simple and backed by sufficient proof.Suddenly, everything became blurred in my mind.-----How did this start? In the autumn of 1953, there had been a great political trial in Pyongyang. During that trial Lion Hao [sic], one of the best known North Korean poets, was condemned to death as an American agent, and so was Hi Kang Kock [sic], administrative director of the Hungarian hospital in Korea and Sol Chang Sik [sic], interpreter of the armistice Commission in Gaesong, a sensitive poet and the first to have translated Shakespeare into Korean.I did not know the men of politics who were condemned at the same time. But I knew personally these three intellectuals and especially Sol Chang Sik, a gentle man with a sensitive soul, always absorbed by questions of conscience, and in whose company I had spent many long evenings engaged in intellectual discussions. He wrote tender, naive poems. One which had especially moved me was dedicated to Hungarian doctors in Korea. I was absolutely certain that this poet could not possibly be an “American agent.”And yet I read in. the newspapers that he himself had ADMITTED HIS TREASON. What was I to think of this? Could I be wrong to such an extent? I simply did not understand. I definitely could not believe it.A year later, I found myself again in the newspaper offices of “Szabad Nép.” Suddenly a man walked into my office. He nearly stumbled. It was a friend for whom I had a very high regard. His face was twisted with emotion. In a strained voice and full of tears, he confided to me that he has not been able to sleep for days. He knew from a reliable source that the whole Rajk trial had been a pack of lies.-----By curious thought association, I thought not so much of Laszlo Rajk as of Sol Chang Sik. His trial also could have been a pack of lies! The train of such thoughts cannot be stopped. If by chance one link in a gold chain is found to be made of common copper, then one is forced to examine carefully every link in the chain.At the twentieth Congress of the Soviet Communist Party, Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev gave out a long list of Stalin’s crimes: mass executions, infamous torture, forced labor camps, unscrupulous murders. Was it possible that the crimes of Stalin had never gone beyond the frontiers of the USSR? Had he been lying to his people only? Had he misled his people on internal political problems only? And what about foreign politics? Had he not marked that with his stamp? And that which was tormenting me most: the war in Korea? And what about the “germ warfare”? 2. I was literally chocking from the self-imposed silence and the doubt. For fourteen months, in articles and in books and stories, I had been informing the Hungarian public of the events in Korea. Come what may, it had now become necessary to let them know of my doubts if I were not to asphyxiate…. On the 27th June, 1956, during the eventful discussions of the Petofi Circle, the precursors of the revolution, I was one of the speakers. Before the meeting, I had informed my friends of my intention to refer, amongst other things, to the questions of the Korean War. I most certainly did not wish to put forward any definite opinions, because I had paid too dearly to learn that without thorough examination, without sufficient proof and a detailed analysis, one has no right to launch accusations but only to ask questions and, where necessary, request a reply. My friends begged me to renounce this project: Rákosi and his cohorts and enough of a concern for us with purely Hungarian matters…By bringing up the Korean question you will just bring the Russians into this and so you will have done Rákosi a favor. \tI had understood that my friends from the Petröfi Circle were right. But they, for their part, had understood that total silence had become unbearable for me. I chose a roundabout way. Speaking about truth in journalism and citing the case of our own journalistic crimes against truth inspired by its distorted view, I evoked a war-time episode in Korea. I quote from memory: “During the winter of 1952, I said, I met at Panmunjom, an area where armistice talks were taking place, a Jugoslav journalist. As a result, in one of my articles I referred to him as an “agent of the imperialist forces” ready to stop at nothing. Today, looking at it in retrospect, I ask myself: what was the truth? This Jugoslav journalist approached us who came from the North and started the conversation in a very cordial, friendly manner. He told us, amongst other things, that Korea was a wonderful country that its landscape resembled that of Serbia, and other generalities of this kind. We, on the other hand, were thinking: “We can read in your kind of game, you imperialist viper, your false friendliness will not deceive us.” We listened to him for a moment, and then we lectured him with hard words. Naturally he did not remain without reacting. And he gave as good as he got. Now, at that time, to our eyes, it seemed to us that our attack was only a just and salutary lesson, whilst his response could be described as the aggression of the shamed ones.”We certainly did not wish to lie. We were even convinced that we were writing the truth. Not a ‘naturalist’ truth, but something much more important. Truth as seen in a wider sense. \tIt is not that we were writing the opposite of what we were seeing, that attitude can in no case be that of a self-respecting foreign correspondent. WHAT WAS HAPPENING WAS MUCH MORE TERRIBLE AND FATAL. It’s that IN ANTICIPATION, we were already seeing the facts IN THE WAY IN WHICH WE WERE EXPECTED TO SEE THEM. In the way in which it was “JUST” to see them. WE HAD CEASED TO SEE WITH OUR OWN EYES, OR TO THINK WITH OUR OWN MIND.That is what I said on that day to the Petröfi Circle. At that time, Rákosi and his followers, as well as Khrushchev and his comrades, already approached the Jugoslav question with great restraint. The episode which I had cited could not lend itself to criticism. The general public however, that is the 6,000 people present at the Petröfi Circle, understood only too well the question which I had wanted to raise. I therefore made up my mind to speak at the very first opportunity with complete frankness of this affair, the affair of the Korean War and of the germ warfare, the memory of which gave me no peace.When, after the crushing of the Hungarian revolution in 1956, I was fleeing from the danger of immediate arrest, I arrived in Vienna via Belgrade. I was called to the telephone on the very day of my arrival. It was an employee of the “Voice of America” who was asking me from Munich if I would give him an interview on bacteriological warfare. He was determined to make me declare that the whole of this affair had been a lie, that I had been duped and my good faith had been abused. I replied that I had written from Korea a whole series of articles on the subject of germ warfare, in which I had reported on things which I had in effect seen. Could I now pretend that I had not seen anything? One thing only was possible, and this possibility has been tormenting me for a long time. And that is: that the explanation which I had been given on the spot had not been in line with the truth.\tSince I am not a scientist, I did not have at my disposal the indispensable means of verification. But in order to get to the bottom of this question of discovering whether these explanations were valid or not, it was necessary above all for me to communicate that which I had seen to objective scientific experts, who had not been forewarned, and that I should seek their opinion. This involved me in long and careful research. I had the feeling that the caller on the line was becoming impatient.“You don't mean to tell me that you still believe in these extravagant stories?”I replied in more or less these words:“My dear sir, for many years I have allowed myself to proclaim things which were founded principally on belief. Please allow me not to talk any more about what I believe or do not believe; allow me to renounce all those conjectures. From now on I do not wish to put forward anything which I have not verified and inspected in person.”That day I made no statement. Could I have acted otherwise? In Korea I had not been forced by any threats to add credulity to germ warfare, or to accept the evidence which I was offered and to report these in the papers. My belief had been genuine. To go and say today that all l that had been a lie, without having reexamined the facts, would have been a worthless declaration. I knew that only those in the know, the scientists, could assuage the doubts by which I was being overcome. Thus, as soon as I arrived in Paris, I set about trying to meet the best specialists in Franca in order to put before them what I had seen and so as to reach through their opinions some sort of idea which could appease my conscience. It was not as a result of the requests made by “Voice of America” that I was searching for an answer; I hoped simply to find the truth. In the course of.my research, I interrogated one after the other, and in that order: Jean Rostand,  the eminent biologist; Prof. Fasquelle, Professor of bacteriology at the Faculty of Medicine in Paris; Professor Seguy, director of the Institute of Etymology in Paris; Dr. Gallut, of the Pasteur Institute and one of the greatest world authorities on cholera; Professor Trefouel, Director of the Pasteur Institute and finally, Professor Lepine, Director of the International Institute of  Prevention of Epidemics. \tIt is thanks to their patience and their good-will, that I am able today to put pen to paper. I thank them and am greatly indebted to them.-----3.The first information bulletin with regard to what is known as germ warfare was the work of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Pak Heon-yeong. This bulletin was dated 22nd February, 1952. If it is to be believed, as from the 28th January last, the American forces of intervention have been regularly dropping in large quantities from the air, germ bearing insects onto our military positions and the hinterland…bacteriological examinations have revealed that these insects are carriers of plague germs, of cholera germs and other infectious diseases.”By a curious and tragic irony, fate would have it that this same Pak Heon-yeong, expelled some months later from his ministerial post, moved progressively down the echelons of power, and finally finished by being condemned to death and executed. It was not, of course, for the above bulletin that he was held responsible.  On the contrary, he was condemned for being, “an American imperialist agent.” \tForty eight hours after the bulletin of Pak Heon-yeong, Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs in Peking, reinforced this bulletin on behalf of the Chinese People’s Republic: “I accuse, before the people of the whole world, the Government of the United States of using, in contravention of all humanitarian principles, and all international conventions, germ warfare in Korea in order to exterminate the peaceful civilians of that country as well as the soldiers.” \tA few days later, I received a telegram from Szabad Nép in Budapest. I was invited to leave Panmunjom immediately, leaving there my reports on the armistice talks and I was told to go into the hinterland in order to describe “the germ war.”On 2nd of March, 1952, in the morning, I left Gaesong to go to the capital of Korea, Pyongyang in the company of a Polish journalist and a Korean journalist. The cold was terrible. We were driving in an open jeep, buried under a heap of coats and blankets. The cold even made our eyes smart. A thick layer of snow covered the mountains and the rivers were frozen. We were progressing slowly and painfully on roads covered with black ice. It was the Korean winter still at its height.In Pyongyang I had an interview with the Minister of Public Health for North Korea, Ri Byung-nam [Li Pyong Nam], who gave me detailed information on “facts and proof” of the bacterial attack. The gist of what he said is as follows:“The first manifestations of germ warfare occurred on 28th January. Some Chinese soldiers reported having discovered here and there, insects of unusual appearance. Health squads were sent to these places forthwith. The insects were examined by bacteriologists who concluded that these were carriers of cholera and plague germs. The first attacks took place along the front in the Choson, Tsoson and Kumhwa areas, and along the Northern bank of the river Han. But later on the American army extended its attacks over the whole territory.”The minister showed me a map upon which the points attacked were marked by a red circle. There were twenty-two circles in all. “The insects are dropped from the aeroplane,” continued the Minister, “in containers and. paper packages of different shapes. They are usually ejected above rivers and springs. It is a fact that the present temperature is nearly always below zero, and never above five degrees. It is therefore not conducive to the spreading of the insects or the multiplying of the germs. A certain number of insects is therefore, destroyed. Anyhow the cholera germ, for example, can survive on ice even after the insect is death and becomes virulent only later.  So that an epidemic could start in spring, in summer or later in the autumn. Several cases of illness had already been notified, and even some deaths. Amongst the germs experts have even discovered some varieties which could contaminate plants.”-----After this statement of a general nature, I was taken to a laboratory. There were a large number of jars and other containers in which I saw numerous insects. On each jar there was a label which indicated the place and date and the person by whom the insects had been discovered. Generally the collectors of these insects were peasants, soldiers and members of village committees. I was shown under the microscope various preparations. One was an internal sample of a flea; it was explained to me that the insect had been found near Choson, on the snow and that the microscope had revealed that it was a carrier of plague germs. Another sample, of fish this time, confirmed the presence of cholera microbes. The fish, according to witness, had been dropped from an American plane. \tAll this sensational evidence, these insects which were rather repulsive to a layman, these  shriveled millipedes, these green spiders and other beasties, as well as the hand-written testimonies, made a deep and painful impression on a spectator like me. An impression compounded of revulsion and horror. It was difficult to avoid this impression. Nevertheless, I managed to express my wish to be present at such a germ attack and said that I could not base my reports upon just a visit to laboratories.I received forthwith authorization for permission and a few days later I was taken to “the places.”\tWe went to Sono-ri, a small village situated some 28 kms from the capital. The earth on its narrow streets was hard with frost except here and there where the sun rays had softened it.\tThe village inhabitants told me that a peasant had found on the ice on the river Daedong [Taedong] near the bank, eight stacks of flies. These flies were alive and in no time they spread over an area of several hundred meters. They were moving about slowly, but in the course of the morning as the temperature rose, they became capable of flying over a few meters. For four days the villagers tried to exterminate them by burning branches and sticks of corn.“How did these flies get to be on the river ice?” I asked.“Every night, a large number of American airplanes fly over our village. They did so during the night of the 27th to 28th February (the eight piles of flies were discovered on the 28th). Furthermore, on the 27th at dusk, four Americans planes circled round for about half an hour, just above the place where the insects were found the following morning. The planes did not drop any bombs and did not machine-gun the village. They came down very low without apparently doing anything.”I went down to the river bank. Right near the edge, some three meters of the river were frozen. Upon this white expanse could be seen, like some funeral bands, traces of the fires which peasants had lit to destroy the insects. I inspected all the charred remnants; not a sign of life. By about the twentieth pile of faggots I .suddenly saw black dots moving on the ice. I bent down to look. It was flies. Flies which crawled about on the ice. Their short-winged elongated bodies moved about awkwardly. In a hollow, the sun has melted the ice forming a puddle. On the surface of this dirty water, some six or eight insects could be seen floating. A little further away on the ice, hundreds more flies were moving about. \t I had come ten days after the discovery of the first lot of flies which they had promptly set about exterminating. I interrogated some old peasants who confirmed that they had never seen this kind insect before in the village. \tI had several of these flies taken to the central laboratory at Pyongyang. After examination, I was informed that they were carriers of cholera germs. After Sono-ri, the river Daedong flows towards the capital. The municipal water distribution service is located between Sono-ri and Pyongyang. Consequently—it was said, it the water is polluted by cholera germs in Sono-ri then automatically so is the water of the capital.\tAll this evidence seemed clear, logical and convincing. And in Pyongyang even more striking facts were put before me. \tI was taken to No.6 Second Street, in the central quarter Namnun-ri. As a precaution, just before going there, I was vaccinated against cholera. I was clad in a rubber outfit from toe to toe. This consisted of trousers which reached well above the waist and a hooded top with only slits for my eyes, black boots and long gloves. Over this outfit I was covered by a white overall and a mask, destined to filter the air, was put over my mouth.\tThe cluster of houses towards which we were heading was surrounded by ropes and was guarded by armed sentinels. It was a no-go area: it was strictly forbidden to enter or leave the area without a special permit. \tIn this place, I was told, three people had died of cholera. An old man aged 68, and two of his grandsons: a little boy aged six and a two year old baby.\tHere is how the case was reported to me by a) the parents of the children, b) the doctor of the Pyongyang Municipal Hospital and c) the president of the commission for the prevention of epidemics: “On 5th March, a Wednesday, at dawn, some American planes circled over the area. In the early morning the old man discovered three heaps of flies in the yard of his house. Near these heaps were found square envelopes and also some leaflets emanating from South Korea. The old man swept away the flies, made a stack of them threw in some fagots and. burned the lot. During that time, the children were playing nearby. The old man tried to make them go away but the children were under the impression that this was a game. Then the grandfather went to wash his hands and ate breakfast with the children.”“The following evening the disease emerged. It was the old man who was the first to complain. Then the six year old boy and finally the baby. Cholera was diagnosed forthwith, its symptoms developing along classic textbook lines. After the death of the three vi6tims, the post-mortem examination entirely confirmed the diagnosis. The president of the commission for the prevention of epidemics added that the flies discovered in the neighborhood had been sent to the laboratory and had in part been found to be carriers of the cholera microbes. There was no doubt that the old man and the children had caught the disease whilst he was sweeping up and burning the flies. Yes, to be sure, he had washed his hands but maybe not very thoroughly. As for the children, no one knew whether they had washed their hands or not. It was during breakfast that the germs must have entered their bodies.”\tThis collection of facts was depressing, horrible. Added to this were certain aspects of an emotional nature which influenced the reporter in me at least as much as all the proofs and explanations.In the village of Sono-ri, a 79 year old man came to find me. He was dressed all in. white and his wrinkled face expressed a great bitterness. I can still re call his words:“I’ve seen some things in my lifetime, but nothing to equal such vileness. If we were nothing but bind logs we would still see these atrocities” said he in his vivid language.” “If we were stones, still would we see these horrors which would make us shudder.”And right in the middle of Pyongyang, a young woman, the mother of the two children who had died of cholera exclaimed, her eyes dry from too much crying, her lips cracked: “Why did they kill them? Punish those guilty of these crimes!”\tThis is what I had to state in order to convey the atmosphere which prevailed at that time in North Korea. To give some idea of the methods of persuasion used, and to show at the same time the facts which were put before us and the passions which were being let lose all around. \tThis is what I had to relate before analyzing the facts themselves. By disregarding all the emotional elements before revealing to the reader the answers and explanations which had been given me by Frenchmen of science to whom I imparted my personal experience.4.\tI reported in detail everything I had seen and heard to the scientists whom I consulted. The precision and scientific rigor of their answers was absolutely convincing. I cannot, of course, in most cases give a detailed account of our discussions which sometimes lasted for hours. I must also leave out in most cases the technical details which, though of utmost interest, could distract the unwary reader. Instead of quoting everything word for word, I have made a point of extracting the gist of my conversations with the scientists. “Is it possible, in theory at least, that one should have wanted to pollute the water of Pyongyang by means of cholera germ bearing flies?”The answer which M. Jean Rostand gave me may be summarized as follows:“Is it scientifically possible for the old man and the two children to have caught cholera whilst the grandfather was sweeping the flies?”“In itself, this cannot be excluded.”“So therefore,” I continued, “the two samples cases which had been brought to my knowledge are not a complete nonsense in scientific terms?”“It is not a question of nonsense,” came the reply. But all the scientists with whom I had this conversation said:“Nonsense, maybe not. But where are the proofs?”“I've just presented to you the case in detail…”“And this is where the shoe pinches.”It was my turn to be showered with questions:“How can one prove that the flies which you saw on the ice of the river Daedong were, in fact, carriers of cholera microbes?”“What about the answer from the laboratory in Pyongyang…”“You say that you yourself arranged for the flies to be taken to the laboratory. Alright. But were you present at the time of the examination under the microscope? Can you say that you have followed from the beginning to end the examination of the insects? Have you any expertise in this matter?…”“None at all!”“So, you could have been given any answer whatever. They could have talked to you about the plague as well as about cholera….You had no means of verifying either. Even comments with regard to the flies, which apparently were the origin of the cholera diagnosis in the old man and his grandchildren…it is not absolutely impossible…but they could have caught cholera in some other way. For example, through food which they had after the flies had been exterminated.”“Obviously, this is just an assumption…All I can say, and this is the crux of the matter, that nowhere has it been proved that the victims actually caught cholera from the flies.”-----…And Dr. Gallut, the eminent specialist on cholera at the Pasteur Institute, asked me: “Can you confirm with absolute certainty that the cholera germs identified under the microscope had in fact, been obtained from the victims cited above as an example?”“Of course, I had not been present at the autopsy of the victims nor at the laboratory tests.”“It's just that cholera germs,” continued Dr. Gallut, “you can find them in quite a few laboratories all over the world. We’ve got some here at the Pasteur Institute. And other institutes have them too. One day we were asked for some from Bucharest for scientific research and we sent them a batch. They are not difficult to produce or to show. By that I do not mean to say that this is what had been done in the case which is of interest to you. I am only saying that the cholera germs which you were shown under the microscope do not in themselves constitute a proof.”-----\tThe answers which I gleaned during my investigation, call into doubt, of course, the evidence and information which had been given me on the spot in North Korea by physicians and scientists mobilized against the germ warfare. I must stress, that amongst these, there were some high-powered Chinse and North Korean scientists, some of whom had received honorary diplomas from Western Universities, Some of them had, by virtue of their activities in the war against Japan and the campaign in Burma, received distinguished American medals.Can one suppose that such people would make statements which are not conforming to truth? That they have issued doubtful opinions which cannot be relied upon? Judging by my experiences during the last few years, I am sorry to have to say that this is in fact quite possibly so.To help the reader forming an opinion, let me cite just two examples:The first of these is known to everyone. It is the affair of Soviet doctors, the so-called “assassins in white coats.” A whole collection of brilliant Soviet scientists confirmed that the accusations made against Jewish doctors (assassination of Zhdanov, attempted assassination of Zhukov and other marshals) were well founded. When some time later the Soviet government admitted that these accusations had been unfounded and that the confessions made by the Jewish doctors had been extracted under duress, again eminent scientists were produced to support with their authority these new statements, which in that case by then were true.The other example is not so well known. In the spring of 1955, when Mátyás Rákosi removed Imre Nagy (representative of the liberal branch of the Communist Party in Hungary) from the government, a medical report was issued to facilitate this removal. According to this report, Imre Nagy was so ill that he had not been able to participate in the meeting of the Central Committee held in March of that year. Altogether, the state of Nagy’s health was such that it was not possible for him to engage in political discussions.This communique was signed by the President of the Hungarian Academy of Science, a Professor of Medicine, whose scientific achievements cannot be doubted by anyone. A little later—a few days later—two members of the Hungarian Politburo and a Soviet delegate, M.A. Suslov, visited Nagy at his home to ask him to practice self-criticism. This visit had been immediately preceded by a second bulletin, signed by the same professor, which stated that due to a visible improvement in Imre Nagy’s health, the latter was now able to engage in matters of politics.There followed a dramatic sensation: NAGY REFUSED TO PRACTICE SELF-CRITICISM. It was quickly decided therefore at the “summit” that it was not sufficient to criticize him, but that it was necessary to exclude him from the Central Committee. AND SO, THE SAME PROFESSOR SIGNED A THIRD HEALTH BULLETIN: “THE STATE OF HEALTH OF THE PATIENT WAS SUCH THAT ALL POLITICAL ACTIVITIES WERE FORBIDDEN FOR HIM FOR THE NEXT FEW MONTHS.” All these maneuvers enabled the preparing of accusations against Nagy, who was absent, and his condemnation in the course of the following session of the Central Committee in April 1955.All this, obviously, does not relate closely to the bacteriological warfare. However, it is this sort of examples which have probed to me that in a Stalinist regime one can break, if not corrupt, a sizeable number of scientists of even the highest integrity. So much so, that they will sign every “scientific” statement presented to them by the government.Such practices are profoundly tragic for all concerned. They are profoundly tragic too for science, because they demean both the scientists and science itself. Unfortunately such practices did exist. That is why, after -my personal experiences, I cannot accept as irrefutable the proofs offered me by the Chinese and North Korean scientists.I have had to arrive at the following conclusion: If the things which I saw in Korea do not in themselves constitute nonsense, they do not, nevertheless constitute proof in the strictly scientific sense. From that point of view, it can even be said to be of no value at all.Yet the opinion of French scientists whom I consulted, did not stop there. In fact it went much further. 5.\tProfessor Seguy is Director of the Etymological Laboratory in Paris. He has been studying the habits and behavior of flies for forty-five years. Without exaggerating, he can be considered the top specialist in this subject. The very fact that the International Scientific Commission for the “Investigation of Facts concerning Germ Warfare in Korea and China,” which in a lengthy report, tried to justify germ warfare, invoked several times the authority of professor Seguy (pages 75, 140, 146, 152), confirms the importance with which he is regarded in the scientific world. \tNow, this same professor Seguy exclaimed before me:“A bacteriological attack unleashed by means of insects? I repeat, by means of insects! But that is sheer fantasy! You can't order insects about like soldiers! Yes, I know the commission report you are talking about. But I have not kept it in my library. Scientifically all this does not hold water.”As for the cases which I told him about, Professor Seguy said to me: “The use of flies in germ warfare seems to me to be quite impossible, for the good reason that they are far from being a good means of transport. Because a fly, contrary to what is general.ly believed, is one of the cleanest insects in existence. Observe a fly. It is constantly cleaning itself. Its saliva has antiseptic properties. It, rapidly destroys the germs which it picks up; very quickly, in a matter of something like half an hour, for example.”“So the fly is not capable of spreading the cholera?”“I did not say that. Where an epidemic is rampant, the flies may alight on victims’ excrements and thus propagate the disease. Even then, however, they destroy the germs they carry in an astonishingly short time.”“So the flies carrying cholera germs which had been dropped from planes…”“This strikes me as freakish, pure imagination. Whether they be packed in containers or in paper envelops, it is quite likely that they would be dead already on landing or else die soon after. In the conditions which you have described, they would probably die of boredom more likely!”“And what do you think of the flies which I saw on the ice, and which, according to what I was told, had been there for some eight to ten days?”“Very strange, to say the least!” replied Professor Seguy, lifting his arms towards the sky. In the room where we are now, the temperature is about 15° above zero and you don’t see any flies.  Everyone knows that flies do not like and cannot withstand the cold. All the more reason why they could not survive on ice for any length of time.”“When I was in Korea, I was told that the Americans where putting to use the “great Soviet scientific discovery” the Mitchourino-Lysenkoist method for obtaining flies able to withstand the cold.”“Here is another thing which I find surprising! I have never heard anything said about any positive results obtained on flies with the “Lysenko method,” which even in the Soviet Union is unofficially said to be contested more and more.”“The oldest inhabitants of the Korean village of Sono-ri have anyway unanimously confirmed that it was a question of flies of a particular kind, the like of which had never been seen in the region…”“What does that prove? In France alone you could count some fifteen thousand different kinds of flies…Quite simply, I repeat, it is not with flies that one can wage bacteriological war.”-----If, so far as flies are concerned, it could be said that all was now clear due to the explanations of one of the greatest etymologists in the world, not all aspects of this question were to my liking.The theory of accusation still hand an emergency door, so to speak. The reader may recall the pronouncement made by the Korean Health Minister, which stated that even though the cholera bearing insects died, the bacteria would survive, even in snow, and would become active so that an epidemic could be unleashed the following summer or autumn. This final emergency door was barred by the formal statement made to me by Dr. Gallut, the eminent specialist on cholera.“The cholera microbe is extremely fragile.” He explained. “Let loose in “the open” it dies within a few hours. It fears the cold, and the temperature of ice is lethal to it. Thaw does not create more favorable environment for it either. It has generally been observed that winter puts a stop to the spread of a cholera epidemic. This phenomenon has even occurred in Egypt, a country with a warm climate, at the time of the 1947 epidemic. Naturally, it is possible to preserve cholera microbes in the cold. They are frozen by means of carbon dioxide snow at a temperature of 70° below zero. At that temperature they are dehydrated in a way and can be preserved for years in tubes.”“Is such preservation not possible in the case which I had seen?”“To reactivate the microbe, it must stay for twenty four hours in a culture solution at 37° above zero. To throw back into the open deep-frozen microbes would be of no use. Such an idea could not even occur to anyone calling himself a scientist.”Thus, all the scientific and pseudo-scientific explanations which had been given me with regard to flies which were carriers of cholera germs, were refuted one by one bowed before the facts: IMPOSSIBLE TO START A BACTERIOLOGICAL ATTACK BY MEANS OF FLIES. It does not make sense to throw microbes on the ice and to say that they could be reactivated later on. I have also had to admit that you could not drop flies from airplanes, like parachute jumpers, and that it was highly likely that flies placed in containers or envelopes would die either before they dropped, or during the fall, or else immediately after they had been dropped.One fact remained clear and undisputable: one question remains unanswered. How did these flies get on the ice? And not only there where I had seen them, but in a large number of other places where the local people had stacks of flies—not to mention other insects—where these local people,  in a low temperature of between -10 and +10 degrees had found and sent thousands of specimens to the laboratory in Pyongyang. Sample accompanied by hundreds of handwritten statements.6.The flies, which I had seen alive, crawling about on the ice of the river Daedong, where did they come from? Let me repeat word for word what I was told in the village of Sono-ri: “Every night, a large number of American aero-planes fly above the village. It was thus on the night of 27th/28th February…. Furthermore, on the 27th at dusk, four American bi-planes circled for about half an hour above the area where the insects were found the following morning. The planes did not drop any bombs and did not machine-gun the village. They came down very low, without apparently doing anything.”And what was the son of the dead old man and father of the two children who all died of cholera telling me in Pyongyang?“On the eve of the day the flies were found, American planes were flying very low, flew round in circles over the area.” In these testimonies we can find a common element:If one does not doubt the testimony of the people who had heard the planes, then it is also a fact that no one had seen the planes with his own eyes. They are solely auditory testimonies. I am quite willing to admit that the planes were American, but in every case nobody had actually seen them drop any containers, envelopes or flies. Only assumptions are put forward in this respect. \tIt is necessary however, to go a little further with this. I consulted the notes which I had taken during my stay in Korea. According to these, I had indeed enquired as to the manner in which these microbe attacks occurred: the insects had been dropped from the plane, in containers and paper sacks of varying shape. “We have not yet got a precise idea as to how they were dropped because up to now the raids have nearly always taken place at night or in cloudy weather.” The conversation which I had with the Korean Health Minister, from which the above quote was extracted, took place fifteen days after the statement made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in which he announced the bacterial attack. If today I reflect upon this more carefully, the meaning is clear. Fifteen days after the accusation against the aggressors had been expressed, the North Korean Health Minister did not yet possess any proof concerning the question: by whom and how were the insects sent? “At night and in cloudy weather.” This means that nobody, absolutely nobody, had seen with his own eyes the attack taking place. The reader could quite rightly ask, how come I had not noticed this flaw, this enormous flaw in the argument? The minister’s statement which I had noted was published in the Hungarian press as well as in my book. Now, neither the editor, nor the editorial secretary nor the proof reader had brought this up. Why? The answer is simple. Right from the start I believed this entire story. And a believer is insensitive to slight contradictions, or even to the most obvious ones.But as soon as the critical reason returns, the opinions which had been simply accepted, are put aside and the process of thinking returns to normal. So then a multitude of obvious arguments become open to doubt. For example, the opinion of the old people in the village regarding the unknown kind of fly, or the reference to Lysenko. On the other hand, some details which until now had seemed insignificant, and which my mind had rejected, suddenly takes on considerable importance. Thus, a certain detail came back to me. There was in Korea a Hungarian country hospital which had been given the name of Mátyás Rákosi. This hospital stayed in different Korean villages. In one of them the peasants found one fine morning flies wrapped in sachets. Immediately it was concluded that this was a germ attack.A little later in the day, one of the Hungarian doctors who himself believed in the bacteriological war, or at least, he appeared to believe in it firmly, told me indignantly: “Some peasants claim that these sachets have not been dropped from planes, but that they have been brought there by Chinese soldiers.” ….We shrugged our shoulders. These stories seemed to us to belong to enemy propaganda, or at best to belong in the realm of the imagination. BUT TODAY, I AM ASSURED BY THE GREATEST SCIENTISTS IN FRANCE THAT THIS BUSINESS OF PARACHUTING FLIES IS, IN THEIR EYES, PURE FANTASY.Now, somehow or other these flies must have been brought there. And since four days had been spent exterminating them on the ice of the river Daedong, where they could only have survived very briefly, new ones must have been brought there every night. In that case, the work must have been carried out by a large network covering the whole of North Korea and must have been present in each of the “22 red circles” whence the thousands or specimens were being sent to the central laboratory.I did not see with my own eyes, as I had seen the flies, those who dropped or put these flies on the ice. I have no definite proof there. I must not, however, avoid mentioning one last detail which, at the time, did not strike me as of any importance, but which I now view in a different light. Looking through my notebook I noticed the following entry:On the 6th March, the Korean Deputy Health Minister- in fact a charming man who, I later heard had apparently been executed as an American agent- told me word for word the following: “As already stated in the note from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, we had in the first instance been notified of the germ attack through REPORTS FROM CHINESE VOLUNTEERS, who claimed to have found some insects of unusual form.” Three days later, on 9th March, I had another conversation with the Minister himself this time. He asked me casually that I should not use the term “Chinese Volunteers” in my future articles but instead to call them “front-line fighter.” He gave me no explanation. Even so, he must have had some reason from making this remark which might have benefited from an explanation.7.One can be wrong, especially if one is not an expert. But I am riot the only one to have testified on germ warfare. A certain number of American pilots have “confessed” to having taken part in the dropping of cholera, plague bearing flies, fleas and spiders. And on the other hand, legal and scientific commissions, comprising men and women some of whom of notorious reputation, also testified.It is unnecessary, I think, to dwell too much on the confessions of the American pilots. Once back in their country they all retracted their statements and denounced the methods by which these confessions had been extracted. Should one believe their retracted statements rather than the confessions? The fact which inclines me to believe the former is the fact that the methods of extortion described by the pilots resemble quite amazingly those which had been obtained from certain political prisoners freed from Rákosi’s jails, and solemnly rehabilitated by the Hungarian Communist Party.To cite and compare the statements made by these two different kinds of witnesses could, I believe, produce a startling if facile effect. I won't attempt to include it in these articles.And what about the reports of the different international commissions?Without wishing for one moment to doubt the personal integrity of the investigators, many of whom must have followed the same path as I, I have tried during my present investigation to do that which at the time seemed superfluous, seeing that I myself had been a witness. I thus studied their reports very carefully. Naturally I will not carry the controversy into the technical ground. But since these commissions often saw the same “proofs” as me, I was allowed to confront our respective experiences. Maybe, I wondered, the commissions had had at their disposal more solid proof than I?Well, as I read the long dissertations of the apparently competent authorities—and no doubt they were competent—more than once I felt myself to be like one of those punching-bags at the fair, put there to absorb the ever stronger punches. Let me just give you two examples:The commission of Association of Democratic Lawyers visited, amongst other places, the same village of Sono-ri which I had visited. I had seen there with my own eyes: flies. Now, the commission of Lawyers confirmed the presence in that village of Sono-ri, and after the same “attack” on February 28th, the presence of ant-like insects. I am not an etymologist, and especially I do not always trust my senses any more. But even so, I am still able to tell the difference between a fly and an ant! It is true that ants had vaguely been mentioned to me also. Had the members of the commission of Lawyers seen these? Or where their findings based on such vague remarks? And why did the commission not say anything about the flies which I had seen, had described and even picked up? First punch on the chin. More striking hit coming up. In answer to my consignment of flies, the laboratory in Pyongyang had replied saying that they were infested with cholera germs. Now, the Commission of Lawyers, when talking about the same case, refers to “bacteria which caused a disease of the intestine.” Even a simple journalist can see that there is some serious divergence there. The report made by the International Scientific Commission, which included among its members many doctors, parasitologists, bacteriologists etc., should have carried more weight. It is a work that is 600 pages long, packed with photographs, verbal proceedings, expert appraisals and all kind of documents. Ju.st flicking through it, the layman becomes dizzy. Maybe that was the purpose of the exercise. Now, it so happens that in some of the cases I had been faced with the same examples as the Commission. Thus, for example, it refers at length (pages 37, 38 and annex 455 and 468 in the English edition) to “the Dai-Dong incident (cholera), in which a Korean peasant woman brought home some shell fish which she and her husband ate. On the following evening, they both died of cholera. The enquiry concluded that the shell-fish had been parachuted from an American plane.Now from the Commission's detailed report, as indeed from my own notes, the following facts emerge: 1. Nobody saw the planes from which the shell fish had allegedly been dropped.2. Neither the members of the Commission nor I had seen the said shell fish with our own eyes. Nor were than any others which might have been found in the area. On all this there are only Korean and Chinese reports. 3. Neither the members of the Commission, nor I saw any or the victims, but we nonetheless accepted as an established fact that they had died from cholera. And so, the most important links in the scientific chain remain missing. Unfortunately this is not an exception but the rule. Besides, the Commission recognizes this as well. Right at the beginning of its report—another punch on the jaw—it says: Naturally this complete chain of proofs (“ideal” series) can only be found very rarely or never. (My underlining.) 8.It is a fact that at no time has the Scientific Commission been able to follow from beginning to end any case of bacterial attack! No more, in fact, than the Hungarian bacteriologist who was sent to Korea from Budapest in order to participate in the defense against germ warfare. He must have concluded fairly quickly that he was not being shown any more than were the journalists and the lawyers. So, instead of fighting on the “germ front,” he ended up working (he wanted to be useful after all) in the Hungarian hospital pharmacy near Pyongyang.At the time, we put our host’s mistrust down to a need for vigilance in time of war and to the naturally “suspicious” temperament of the Chinese. Today, I wonder whether the truth was not much simpler than that. In these conditions, how can it be that highly qualified scientists should be directed their efforts into proving scientifically the existence of germ warfare? A statement made by one of the European members of the Commission (whose name I will not mention this time) throws some light on this question. He says: “We were so convinced of the integrity of our hosts, that we believed all the statements they had made to us with regard to the American use of bacteria in the war. The “scientific” work undertaken by the Commission was founded on the implicit belief in the accusations made and evidence produced by the Chinese and North Koreans.” Implicit beliefs…a bit like me. They believed because they wished to believe. They wanted to prove the accusations in which they believed right from the start. But belief is not enough to bring about scientific proof. And not one of the French scientists whom I considered the report made by the International Scientific Commission, Professor Trefouel, Director of the Pasteur Institute, told us: “This report proves nothing. These assertions are not substantiated by any (peremptory) arguments. Therefore, I give it no credit. In any case, as far as I know, all the experiments in the world which could have been carried out on germ warfare, have been of a defensive nature. In order to start a bacteriological offensive, one would have to be familiar with the ‘spirit of epidemics;’ that is, the trigger mechanism of an epidemic. And that is not the case. The state of our knowledge is such that at best one could, without danger to the aggressor, contaminate a restricted community, such as, say, Staff Headquarters. And, even then…”Thus, so far as the value of the International Scientific Commission is concerned, the opinion of one of the best of Frances' scientists is absolute. Just as absolute is the opinion of Professor Lepine, whose work is most highly regarded in the whole of Eastern Europe too. Professor Lepine refuses to consider this report as scientific work. It contains so many gaps. The connection between cause and effect are so slight that the work does not hold water.With regard to the spiders which are so often referred to in the International Scientific Commission’s report, Professor Lepine has highlighted a most curious fact. It is something that happened at the beginning of the Korean War. The American Medical Authorities were, indeed afraid of a plague epidemic, because in neighboring Manchuria a number of cases had been notified. A scientist of high repute, Dr. Smadell, who was at the time working for the army, asked to be allowed to go with a few colleagues to Madagascar, one of the French, overseas territories, where some cases of plague had also been notified. He was interested in Madagascar for two reasons. First, because the climatic conditions of the area where the disease had broken out where similar to those in Korea. Secondly, because some new antibiotics had just been tried in Madagascar.Having obtained the necessary authorization, the mission got on with the work. One member of the party was an etymologist, who in his spare time had been collecting spiders for many years. In spite of the discreetness observed by the mission, rumor spread that there was a “secret” American mission on the island. That it was studying the plague…that it was collecting spiders- obviously with the intention of spreading the plague. Of course, no proven connection exists between the rumors abounding on the mission in Madagascar and the report of the International Scientific Commission. But, what is certain, is that the plague is not spread by spiders.Professor Lepine had pointed out another interesting fact. The International Scientific Commission had invited a well-known Danish scientist named Henri Lassen, whose ideas were moreover quite progressive, to participate in their work. He went to the relevant areas, studied the question of germ warfare for a month, but returned from the Far East without having signed a single report. He was of the opinion that he knew no more after the came back than he did before he left. Let’s compare this attitude with that adopted by the only bacteriologist on the International Scientific Commission, N.N Zhukov-Verezhnikov, member of the Soviet Academy of Medicine. The latter, in fact made the following statement: “The American imperialists have perpetrated a new kind of crime. They have carried out a bacterial attack against Korea and the People’s Republic of China.” What is interesting in this statement is not its content, but the fact that the Soviet scientist had made it some three months before the Commission’s conclusions, of which he was a member, had been reached!According to a definition borrowed from Stalinist terminology, there exist actually two sorts of science: “bourgeois” science and “socialist” science. But from my personal experience, I cannot believe that there can exist an imperialist bacteriology or a proletarian bacteriology. This is not where the difference lies. Nor does it lie in the extent of knowledge, since Soviet scientific knowledge is well recognized. The difference lies more in the individual attitude which is adopted by a scientist and, even more, in the circumstances which determine whether the stance adopted is that of a Lassen or a Zhukov.9.I must add something with regard to the International Scientific Commission, which may appear to be something of a digression, but which is, in fact, the shortest way to get back to my subject.This was something which took place in November 1955 in Budapest. There was a general assembly of the Communist members of the Hungarian Writers’ Association. As early as that time, the majority of Hungarian Communist writers could see that Rákosi’s policies where leading the country towards disaster. Which is what we were discussing with passion, my colleagues and I, during that meeting. One of the first speakers to address the meeting was Tibor Déry, whom I consider to be our leading contemporary Hungarian novelist. He made an impassioned plea for freedom in literature, referring to the ignorance and ill-will of the “Ubureaux.” This old militant, who had spent his whole life in the service of socialism came to the bitter conclusion that the regime which called itself socialist, allotted to writers nothing but the role of “court jester.”Márton Horváth, the spokesman for the official line, replied Dery in outrageously violent terms, interspersing his attack with personal allusions.Taking my turn to speak, I tried to prove that Déry had been quite justified in his defense of the writer's rights, but that perhaps his comparison to the “court jesters” was a little “exaggerated.”Why should I now be recounting these things? It's because after my conversations with the French scientists and the patient study of the international “scientific” reports, the Déry form of words keeps coming back to mind.The readers of this series of articles, may perhaps remember the description I gave of my arrival at Pyongyang into the central quarter of Namnun-ri, where an old man and his two grandsons had just died of cholera. As a precaution I had been vaccinated against cholera, then I was made to put on a rubber outfit consisting of trousers which reached high above the waist, a hooded top which allowed only my eyes to be exposed, black boots and long gloves, as well as a white overall on top. My mouth had been covered with a mask destined to filter the air.Well now, in the course of my conversations with the French scientists, I learned some interesting things. Against cholera, you do not need one, but two vaccines, which have to be given at an interval of seven days. You are first given four billion units, and then eight billion units. Immunity is not acquired until a few days later. The injection which I had been given half an hour before going to the area was therefore not worth anything. I couldn’t believe my ears. What kind of gruesome comedy had I been made part of? After all, if the danger of infection did exist, then this injection would have been of no help to me. So this was just a stage set. And if the danger did not exist then why bother to vaccinate me at all? Again, just a staging of a fake performance. And I who had allowed myself to criticize Déry’s turn of phrase. “In a Stalinist system, the writer is a court jester!” Bitterness fills my heart. Yes indeed, I had been a court jester, a clown. With a cap: a mask to filter the air; with pointed shoes; rubber boots. And after me, how many more had been made fools in the same way? Writers, lawyers, scientists!I have not told everything yet. I have just examined in detail the report of the commission of lawyers. On page 8 (English text), I find the following quote: “in the town of Pyongyang—mentioned later—two people became ill on 6th March, and another person on the 8th. Two of them died on the 8th March. That area of the city of isolated.” The report says nothing more. Now, this is precisely the case which I had reported in my third article. I described it at length in my reports and in my book. That is, an old man and two of his grand-sons had died from cholera. That they had been struck down after the grand-father had swept some germ-carrying flies which had been dropped from an American plane.No, really, so much cynicism is too much. The death of three people had been described to me in detail. The commission of Lawyers which arrived there after me, had only two deaths to record. The opposite might have been conceivable. But that one of the deceased could have risen from the dead is not. Which of the three did not die? The grandfather, the six year old boy or the two year old baby? Once you start in the direction of doubt, can one not ask oneself: had there been a single death from cholera on the 8th March in Pyongyang?-----I remember the turmoil which this triple decease had caused me. What curses had I not made against the aggressors of germ warfare! Today, I am reluctant to quote from my own writings, but it must be done.“At Pyongyang the bacterial aggression has claimed three dead. An old man aged 68 and .two little boys. It is against them that this germ war is waged. It is they--who are killed by American forces. They, the defenseless, the old and the children. Thousands of flies, epidemics are let loose upon them. What a dreadful deed! Can humanity tolerate such crimes?”“The grave of the old mason, builder of the house, and of the two children, for whom the death-carrying flies had been a sort of game, is outside the town. It is an anonymous grave. Only their ashes rest there, buried two meters below the ground. Even the parents do not know the exact spot. Nobody ever takes flowers there. Never will their brother, their son or their mother visit the grave. It stands there silent amongst the silent mountains.”“But humanity will not forget this grave. Billions of people will surround it with weeping eyes, and will say goodbye to the old mason and to the two little boys. And millions will brandish their fist and will cry out, just as the Korean mother had done: ‘Punish the criminals!’”Whom did I mourn so much? In whose name had I uttered these emotional curses? Who today can give me the answer? The court jester went on and wept. That was his role. Many simple honest people went on and wept. But somebody was laughing someone must have been laughing with an infernal laughter at such a farce. 10.Why the need for all this staging? Why the need for all these accusations, these gruesome efforts, this comedy? The first reason seems to me to come from the source. Let me refer to Orwell's 1984, which throws a cruel light upon the ways of a Stalin-like regime, and whose small number of copies which found their way into Eastern Europe have enjoyed an almost exaggerated reputation am-0ngst clandestine readers. Orwell's formula is as follows. “Two minutes of hate”, means that every day, the propaganda machinery devotes two minutes to stirring up hate in the citizens' hearts. Well now, at the time of the “germ war”, which was a period of extreme tension, the daily dose of hatred was assured by the accusations made against the instigators of germ warfare.It was one of the best orchestrated, the most powerful campaigns in history. Perfect, from the point of view of organization. Nothing was forgotten. From the meeting of the inhabitants in a block of flats, to a world congress. Hundreds of thousands of protests were sent. From Peking to Vienna, in a whole series of capital cities, exhibitions were organized with germ warfare as the theme. An impressive number of U.N.O sessions were devoted to indictments and to moving speeches. I know that in the West these accusations were not met with little credulity. But the countries at which this propaganda was aimed were not of the Old or of the New World. They were the countries of Asia. One can moreover understand why this was so. The first atom bomb was destined for Asia. It was in Asia that the napalm bombing undoubtedly caused the greatest ravages. The people of Asia have therefore good reason for being receptive to accusations made against foreigners and whites. I was present in 1952 at the World Peace Congress in Peking, and I was able to witness the unanimous hatred with which Indians of the Congress. Burmese priests and Trotskyites from Ceylon condemned the “bacteriological warfare.”Obviously, one could describe all these delegates as “sympathizers” or “fellow travelers.” But it will be remembered that in July 1952, the Pakistani delegate abstained from voting on the question of germ war in the U.N.O resolution. Now, everyone knows that Pakistani politics is much closer to that of the USA than to that of the USSR who represented the accusers. Even so, the Pakistani delegate was content to call for a thorough investigation into mater instead of refuting the accusation, because “if these accusations are well founded,” he said, “then the people of Asia are victims of the most horrible weaponry that humans could use.” He then added: “It is true, that if these accusations were unfounded, then these same people were taken in by a cruel farce.” “In either case,” he continued, “they will have suffered terribly.”I cannot speak of this hate campaign as someone who is a complete stranger to it or a mere spectator. When I read again what I had written at the time, I am overwhelmed by burning shame. My articles were like oil poured over fire. And I cannot even say in my defense that I had distributed the oil sparingly. I cannot ask for my acquittal on the grounds of having myself been taken in and that I did not know what I was doing. These excuses were used by the Nazis. I consider them unworthy of me and of carrying little weight. Whatever the arguments which I may put forward in my defense, facts remain facts. I have contributed to the propaganda campaign surrounding the germ war. Due to my position and as a result of the role I played, I must be held accountable. My only excuse could be that of having recognized the truth and not to have hesitated to tell it. I don't have to settle the question in order to know if my present attitude can offset my past liabilities.Over and above the campaign of hatred, the accusations of “germ warfare” had yet another objective. One of the greatest hate campaigns went on hand in hand with another, not less important campaign. That of public health.If, at the time, there were sporadic reports of outbreaks of contagious diseases in Korea, I was not aware- even though I was there- of a single real epidemic. For an epidemic to start, and here all the scientists I consulted are in agreement, germs alone are not enough. You need favorable conditions of a special kind. A country devastated by war, whose inhabitants are under-nourished, do, of course, provide the sort of conditions in which an epidemic can spread more easily than in time of peace. Furthermore, Manchuria, neighboring on Korea, had at that time had several outbursts of epidemics. Now, the Chinese forces of intervention were largely composed Manchurian soldiers. It was perfectly possible that they spread all kinds of disease. And yet, except in isolated cases, real epidemics had never had to be faced. Why? This was explained to us by arguing the efficiency of the defensive measures taken against the “bacteriological aggressor.” The “infamous aggression” had failed, thanks to a prompt show of strength. Facts are facts. It is a fact that the Korean and Chinese authorities were at the same time launching a campaign against the “supporters of germ warfare” thus spurring on an unprecedented campaign of public health, quite unknown till then. A large number of hospitals were established against epidemics. The whole North Korean population was vaccinated against a number of diseases. Each person had to carry their certificate of vaccination. It was impossible to enter a public building or be allowed into a theatre without showing credentials. Each time we left Pyongyang by car and each time we returned there, our vehicle was disinfected. Around the capital a whole network of first-aid posts filtered the traffic. Everywhere, there were barriers and check-points. Corpses had to be burned and their ashes buried deep in the ground. Existing public lavatories were condemned, and new ones had to be built at a prescribed distance from dwellings. The well-holes were regularly cleaned. They had to be closed, and the more important ones were guarded by soldiers. The drains were constantly disinfected Stagnant water was systematically drained. New stables were erected at a given distance away from human dwellings. There were strict orders specifying that it was forbidden to drink water which had not been boiled.In the name of defense against germ warfare, the whole country was swept by a wave of cleanliness. Everywhere people were spring-cleaning. Floors and pavements were washed. Walls were whitewashed, domestic rubbish was burned, and dishes were boiled. This campaign spread to neighboring China. Travelers who like me visited that country at the time, in answer to questions, found themselves saying: “Our pig output has doubled, we produced 20% increase in rice, 12% more kaolin, and in addition, we exterminated 424,352 flies!” Except for the figures, the answers were all very much the same. You may laugh, nonetheless, it was true.What an infernal paradox! A hatred campaign used, when all is said and done, in order to promote public health!Those who, like me have witnessed these events, who have gone all the way, cannot help but ask themselves with bitterness: Given a little more effort and care, could not the same results have been achieved by other means? Is there no honest path which leads to honest aims?11.How could I have believed it? This is the question which I keep asking myself. “How could you have really believed it?”  is what others keep asking me. What struck me most during my enquiry, is that the scientists to whom I spoke, were not particularly surprised that I should have been taken in. Whilst I was telling M. Jean Rostand in detail what I had seen, he interrupted me smilingly at one point and said: “For heaven's sake, if you continue like this, I will end up by believing it myself…”Others concluded:All this fabrication can seem perfectly logical and convincing to the layman. So it seems that to have believed in this affair was quite natural for a layman. Even so, I still need to ask: “How, even as a layman could one have believed this? Well, I think that it is because in addition to the clever “construction'' and its spectacular effect, there were other reasons which—if I may say so—added weight to my credulity. Reasons which made me receptive, which turned me into a “suitable subject,” a malleable subject.-----To start with, I was a sort of believer. I believed righteousness unreservedly in the absolute correctness of the USSR cause. Especially because of the role it had played during the Second World War. I believed in the infallibility of Stalin, in the Hungarian Party, in Rákosi.I remember the first evening I spent in Moscow. A car drove me from the airport to my hotel, and on the way we passed the length of the Kremlin wall. I was moved to tears at the mere thought that somewhere there behind a window, no more than some one hundred meters away, may be Stalin!…It's a tragedy that a whole generation brought up on the skepticism nourished by Voltaire, and who came to the Communist Party of their own free will, should have turned into a generation of believers—and thoroughly fanatical believers at that—once they were within the Party. When Marx was asked by his daughters which was his favorite proverb, he answered; “de omnibus dubitandum” (we must question everything). Half a century later, the most militant advocates of Marxism-Leninism could easily have chosen their motto: “creedo quia absurdum” (I believe because it is absurd).Apart from the general fanaticism, which I am not trying to minimize, I had had experience of certain things in North Korea which prepared me to accept straight away the accusations made of American germ warfare.At the time when this accusation was being made, I had already been in North Korea for nearly six months. I was staying in the area where the armistice negotiations were taking place. But I also visited the front line and the hinterland. Today, when I am forced to admit theinanity of these germ war accusations(and I admit it without hesitation), I must not refrain from mentioning a whole series of actions taken by the American forces, and especially by the American Air Force, some of whose methods of fighting exceeded those normally acceptable in war and which provoked horror within the onlooker.I refer in the first instance to what is called “air terror”. The American Airforce as good as reigned supreme in the sky. Thanks to that supremacy, it inflicts such destruction that few houses remained unscathed in North Korea. From one day to the next I witnessed the disappearance of insignificant villages. I saw along the roads hundreds of corpses of peasants all dressed in white. I saw towns of 150 to 200,000 inhabitants reduced within two years of war to wasteland upon which you could grow corn. I saw with my own eyes hundreds of women and children affected by this most inhuman of weapons, napalm. I am familiar with all the objections: the Communists did not declare “open” their towns….Chinese soldiers were camping in the villages…psychological resistance in North Korea had to be overcome.Of course, I can today understand the crushing responsibility of the North Korean government, to whom human life came cheap. It -is true that urban conurbations were not declared open cities. It is a fact that Chinese units were often stationed in the villages. And then, I know also, that “war is war” and there are always a great many innocent victims.Even so, the simple peasants were in no way responsible for the stationing of the Chinese. The workmen, small shopkeepers and artisans in the towns could not by themselves declare their city as “open” And what about all those villages which had been razed to the ground, without there ever having been a single Chinese. And the city areas, which had been obliterated, even though they were nowhere near any military objective.Another thing. I had the about the worst possible information about the regime of Syngman Rhee. I am not talking about information from Communist sources. It was in “The Daily Mirror” in which I read: “Syngman Rhee is a vain and savage dictator, whose long and sinister past stinks of corruption, intrigue and violence.” It was a Member of the Labour Party who had declared in The House of Commons: “All England is anxiously following the overtures of the double dealing South Korean assassin.”Today, I am well aware the North Korean Government was composed of Stalinist puppets, all just as murderous, whose hands were just as stained with blood as those of Rákosi in Hungary. But that does not mean that I see in Syngman Rhee’s men the ideal leaders of future Korea. Far from it. -----Let me continue. I will now move on to China. I went there three times. In 1951, in 1952 and in 1953. In my experience, which is shared by many Western, non-Communist observers, the immense mass of the Chinese people has taken much more favorably to the policies of Mao than to those of Jiang Jieshi. I do not know whether the feelings of the Chinese towards Mao and his followers have changed. All I know is that the countries from the, so called, “Socialist block” whose conditions of life had been able to observe, it seemed that the longer the Party had been in power, the greater the increase in the number of people deceived. But I repeat, I do not know the present feelings in China.Yet, in spite of all the negative phenomena which I had mentioned with regard to the role played by official China in the bacterial war, I must express the opinion that a more tolerant and understanding attitude towards Chinese problems would be a better policy than the rigidity and intransigence which is now shown to it by certain Western Powers.As to the simple Chinese soldiers whom I met in Korea, I must say that their relations with the civilian population—not a negligible factor—were extraordinarily good. These soldiers were so willing to help the poor villagers in every way, that these poor people often preferred them to their own soldiers. And if what I had heard said in the village, where the Hungarian hospital stayed about the insects brought in by Chinese soldiers, were true, then these must have referred to some special teams under order from higher up. One final factor could have contributed to my believing in the accusations thrown at the “perpetrators of germ warfare.”  The leaders and the United States press had never denied that there had been in their country a research connected with germ warfare. During the discussions at the United Nations, Mr. Cohen, the American representative, whilst stressing the defensive nature of this research, did nevertheless admit them. At the same time, it is also a fact that the Government of the United States had indeed signed the1925 Geneva Convention prohibiting the use of bacteriological weapons, but this signature had never been ratified.I had to go into all these details. I think I have been a biased political supporter long enough to know that I must be content with nothing but the whole truth, or at least the truth such as I see it. I have already said at the beginning of this series of articles how I was overtaken, little by little, by doubt. And how I had to acknowledge the crimes of Stalinism. I must add a fact which I had only discovered recently. I must admit that it was this fact which caused my cup to overflow.Here it is. The first person to have made an accusation concerning the criminal use of germs was none other than Joseph V. Stalin. On 7th January, 1933, during a meeting of an extended Central Committee and of .the Central Commission of Control over the Communist Bolshevik Party of the Soviet Union, Stalin, whilst speaking about ''criminal activity” of certain Soviet citizens, said “ that they deploy a method of sabotage in the State farms and kolkhozes, and that a few amongst them, including certain academics, manifest such zeal for sabotage that they inject plague and anthrax germs into the cattle at collective farms. And that they favor meningitis germs for horses, etc.….”During the great trials of 1937-38, trials which we know now had a variety of accusations gorged to suit the cause, two defendants mentioned similar facts. One admitted “that he had cultivated virulent germs in three different establishments in order to kill some herds of Soviet pigs.” The other one admitted “that he plotted with Japanese spies to release, in case of war, some particularly virulent microbes amidst the Red Army!”The chief prosecutor in these fabricated trials was A. Vyshinsky. The same Vyshinsky who has since been delicately disowned by Soviet Lawyers. The same Vyshinsky who, whilst he was Minister of Foreign Affairs in Stalin’s day and let the Soviet Delegation at the United Nations, lodged the most terrible accusations with regard to “germ warfare” in Korea!12.I have come to the end of my investigation. This is all I have to say. I know that for some I will have said too little. And for others, I will have said too much. Some people during my investigation showed interest in this work but, they added: Of course, the -thing would be quite “open” if you could explain exactly how the preparation of the bacterial campaign was hatched behind the scene in the Politburo. If you could show the exact role played by the Russians and the Chinese, etc.…It would obviously have been more of a sensation to have started my account something like that: “I know from a reliable source, from the mouth of a Chinese Minister himself, that one day Stalin called in Beria and Molotov and told them: “Listen guys…” It is possible that this is just what had been the case. But it is also possible that the truth was quite different. I don't know, and I will refrain from giving details which I do not know.For others, to have even put forward facts verified by me personally was still too much. They believe that ultimately a lie can be tolerated, but that its exposure is treason.And without going into the details which could bring them face to face with a painful truth, they prefer to ask: “What's the point of it?” I won't say that this question makes no sense. On the contrary, I won't avoid the answer. It is evident that those who will benefit from my testimony are those who were accused of having started a germ war. And those who will suffer from it are the ones who had drawn up this accusation. But if anyone was accused wrongly, is it not a duty for those who are aware of this false accusation to speak out?So then, some sanctimonious rogues may say, all this will benefit “the American Imperialists and capitalists”. This comment we have already heard at the time of our struggle against Rákosi’s regime. I can remember one day, in the corridors of the Hungarian Parliament, Rákosi himself put the question before some colleagues and me: “Why tell everybody that the Hungarian worker does not live well? You will sow doubt in the hearts of French and Italian workers who are convinced that our workers have a good life. This way you would only serve the exploiters of the working class.”In Rákosi’s eyes, the worry was not so much the fact that the workers' standard of living was low, but that this fact should be known. And since everything we might say—we, the Hungarian intellectuals—would not cross beyond the border of our country, the Hungarian revolution, by suddenly allowing truth to erupt before the world, may have stunned many a well-meaning Western worker and intellectual.My intention is not to indulge in a comparative analysis of the imperialist states which exist in the world. Nor do I wish to ask the question: Who is the greater oppressor of the people? Who exploits them more? I will simply say: If, as we are taught by Marxism-Leninism, American imperialism was full of lies and contradictions, why not simply denounce these contradictions and lies? Why is it necessary to invent new ones?I most certainly wouldn't wish the bricks extracted from one wall of lies to serve in the construction of a pile of prejudice, hypocrisy and arrogance. If I have written these articles it is not so as to contribute in whatever form to the lowering of even one worker's wages. To contribute to the taking away of land from the Hungarian or Chinese peasant. It is not so that a descendant of a Czar should return to the throne of Russia or a descendant of Li, to the throne of Korea.It is not out of the question to suppose that my testimony doesn’t pass almost unnoticed, that someone makes use of it directly or indirectly to ends of which I do not approve. I am not afraid of this, because I am convinced that my testimony is more likely to serve those who believed in the accusations, that the accused themselves. It will perhaps contribute to the dispersing of the fog and the darkness which at present extend from the Danube to the Yellow sea. And with my scant means I will have helped truth to emerge. Why should this be of less interest to the Russian worker, the Chinese peasant, the Korean fisherman than of interest to anyone else? I believe that it is precisely for them that this is most important.Some people will say—and I can hear them already—that there exists another fog and other lies, in the United States, for instance. That is true, no doubt. Great American writers—not to mention French and English ones—often denounce the inconsistencies and social ills of their society. They will continue to do, I imagine. Without wishing to lecture anyone and by simply following my own course and that of so many Hungarian writers, I can say that the best a writer can do is to sweep his own doorstep. If, for example, Soviet writers had done less “exposing” of the West, and instead had shown, however discreetly, more of Stalin's crimes (pure wishful thinking, I know), then the world would be better for it, and so would certainly be Soviet literature.Several people have asked me if I was not afraid that people might say: “Here is a witness who said ‘yes’ in the past and who is saying ‘no’ today. Had I thought of that?” Yes, I had. And this is precisely what was tormenting me. But just because I had been mixed up in a lie, through both the fault of others as well as my own, must I remain with it to the rest of my days?A great many Hungarian writers and journalists have had to face the same question: “You’re a good one to talk about the crimes committed by Stalin and Rakosi.” Poets were told. “You who had written odes to them!” “You’re a good one to talk about troubles of the peasants and the hardship of the workers, you who had written a poem entitled: “A victory each day!” We had the personal experience of passing under the whips and it was the crimes, the mistakes and the errors of the past which were hitting us.And yet this path had to be taken. Quite simply because there was no other way. Happy, and to be envied are those who have never erred. Those who have no amends to make. I am not one of them.To all that, I will add a series of paradoxical events. I’ve already said that the Korean Foreign Minister who had thrown the germ accusations had been executed and that the Deputy Health Minister disappeared without trace. On the other hand, the journalist who at that time when I was sending my reports from Korea, was editor of the Foreign Affairs Section on the Szabad Nép (central paper of the Hungarian Workers Party) as well as his colleague who had been the proof reader of my Korean book before its publication, were both thrown into prison in Hungary for having taken part in the revolution. The other day, there was a knock on the door of my modest room in Paris where I am now a refugee. It was the ex-editor of “Szabad Nép,” the same who had signed the telegram sending me from Gaesong to the “germ war” area. At the time, he believed in it firmly. Since then, he has had to leave Hungary for also having taken part in the revolution.The Hungarian revolution was the revolution of people who had been duped, of  “nation deceived. Of workers who had been told lies and told that they had become the owners of their factories. Of peasants who had been given land to appease them but which was now being taken away from them. Of intellectuals who had been deprived of their sole treasure: reflection.If there had not been such flagrant differences between the facts and the words, if there had not been an abyss between the propaganda and reality, perhaps the revolution would not have broken out.“What’s the point of all that?,” the author of these articles has been asked. Well, what was the point of all the lies, deceptions, the cheating in Korea, in Hungary and elsewhere?-----To end, I should like to say a few words to those who, with me, took part in the propaganda surrounding the bacteriological warfare, and who lent credence to it with their name and authority. I beg them to think once again about what they had seen in Korea. That they reconsider all that in the light of Khrushchev’s revelations; in the light of the affair of the doctors and the events in Hungary. If they have any doubts, let them be made public, just as at the time, their evidence had been made public.I should also like to turn towards the Chinese Peoples Republic. Various Communist individuals, Poles, Yugoslavs, who have recently spent some time in China, have informed me that some Chinese leaders in the course of friendly conversations, stated that they considered the whole Korean War to have been a mistake into which they had been pushed by Stalin. And that they believed the accusations made about germ warfare to have been without foundation. If that is so, and I do not doubt it, then it is not enough to exchange such confidences in small gatherings and in cozy chats during a nice dinner. It is certain that if the Chinese leaders were today telling the truth on the war in Korea in general and on germ warfare in particular, this could contribute towards an international lessening of tension and generally improve the international situation of the People’s Republic of China. They would thus make a bigger step towards reconciliation and towards peace than a dozen Peace Congresses and the releasing of thousands of white doves. -----After so many tragedies and national catastrophes, having come from a country which has seen so many ruins and so much sorrow, and as stateless that I now am, I nevertheless retain the hope that the world will one day find a way to progress in peace without either 'A' bombs or ‘H’ bombs. I trust in man who, though fallible, weak and responsible for many faults, in man who can be deceived once, twice, a hundred times, but who continues to thirst for truth and who, in spite of everything, ends by finding it—or at least come near it. That is why I undertook the painful task of examining my past. I am happy to have done so.I don't know whether complete freedom and peace are possible in this world. However, I now feel more free and more at peace than before.END\n",

      "23 May 1989, 09:00 amDeputy Foreign Minister, Cde. Olimpia Solomonescu,On 22 May, I was invited at the [Chinese] Ministry of Foreign Affairs, for a discussion with Dai Bingguo, the Director of the Bureau for USSR and East-European socialist countries. [He] gave a presentation on the recent visit by Mikhail Gorbachev in the People's Republic of China. The main points of his presentation were:1. This high level Sino-Soviet summit, taking place after over thirty years from the last [such meeting], represents the normalization of the relationship between the two states and the two parties. A. Both parties agreed—during the talks—that the bilateral relations must be governed by the five principles of peaceful co-existence, agreement which was reiterated in the communique. It is for the first time when both sides accept the aforementioned principles as the basis for their interaction, and this has a major significance. If, in the future, the [bilateral] interaction will follow those principles, there will be a healthy and natural development of the bilateral relations. B. The development of the inter-party relationship will be developed on the four principles: mutual respect, non-intervention in internal issues, independence and autonomy, and full equality [among the states]. In the future, there will be professional exchanges and reciprocal information between the two parties, though the modality of accomplishing this was not decided on during the meeting. C. Both sides declared that the normalization of their relationship is not directed against any other state. 2. In the spirit of \"ending [the problems of] the past and opening [new] perspectives,\" sincere discussions took place, addressing the problems of the past. In the spirit, Deng Xiaoping, representing the position of the Chinese side, told [his interlocutor]:A. In the past, the great powers have divided and humiliated China. Japan has caused the greatest damage [of all major powers] but, the Czarist Empire and the Soviet Union—during a certain time—had taken great advantage [of China's weakness]. Through inequitable treaties, including the understanding at Yalta and the treaties with the Kuomintang (the [Chinese] Nationalist Party), the Russians took from China a surface of about 3 million square Km—including the present day Popular Republic of Mongolia, territory which is [rightfully] China's.B. In the past 30 years, the main threat to China came from the Soviet Union, which, after the cooling of relations [during Sino-Soviet split] has concentrated troops in Mongolia and at the [Sino-Soviet] border and has placed missiles in the region. C. The main problem of the bilateral relations was the position of the USSR vis-a-vis China, which was treated from a position of superiority and inequality. Those things were said—Dai Bingguo said—so that the Soviets will know the Chinese position and, in the future, the relationship will go smoother. The Soviets mentioned that they do not entirely agree with the Chinese position, but recognized that, in regards with some issues and during a previous period, they [the Soviets] have made mistakes. 3. In regards with the important situation of Cambodia, the Chinese have, once more, made clear their position:A. It is necessary that the Vietnamese troops withdraw and that a deception be prevented.B. After the withdrawal of the Vietnamese [troops], and before the elections, it is essential that a coalition government, formed from all the four factions and headed by the N. Sihanouk, be created.C. To prevent a civil war, the reduction of [the existing] forces of the four factions to small and equal levels is necessary.D. A [public] declaration must be made [in which] foreign aggression must be condemned. [The government of] Vietnam has not abandoned its plans for the formation of an Indo-Chinese Federation. The position of the Soviet [government] has remained different from the Chinese position, [especially] in regards with the main points: the Soviets are opposed to the formation of a provisional government and want, actually, to allow the Heng Samrin government to play [an important] role during the transition and maintain the consequences of the Vietnamese invasion. [The Soviets] are accepting the Vietnamese position. In this problem there were no breakthroughs and the two sides agreed to continue consultations.4. Other problems of bilateral interest.A. Both sides have agreed to reduce the number of troops at their common border to a lower level, corresponding with the [new] friendly, neighborly relations. There was an agreement regarding the creation of a working group of diplomats and military experts, without suggesting its function.B. The Chinese [government] expressed its hope that the Soviet [government] will withdraw all its forces from the Popular Republic of Mongolia (not just the three-fourths as promised) and the Soviets said that they would consider it after consultations with the Mongolian government.C. Both sides convened to connect the problems of the western and eastern borders and find a common solution, though there was no concrete proposal in this regard. The current negotiating structure will continue, but the next round of negotiation has not yet been specified.5. During discussions regarding important problems in the world community, [the conclusions] were [as follows]:Both sides expressed their support for the fundamental improvement of the condition of international life and for reaching this objective; the Chinese government expressed its belief that a new world order must be instituted, [a world order] based on the five fundamental principles of peaceful co-existence. 6. The Soviet government voiced its belief that \"a new political way-of-thinking\" must be adopted. Both sides agreed not to attempt to gain hegemony in Asia, the Pacific, and the world, and to oppose any [state] which tries to obtain any type of hegemony. The Chinese government reaffirmed its devotion to its independent policy of peace, [indicating] that it will not seek any allies and will not enter any strategic partnerships with other states. During an exchange on the problems of constructing socialism, the two sides agreed that there is no unique model for reaching developing socialism and socialist reform, each countries taking actions based on its own specific situation. There was an agreement on sharing experiences on the process of reform as it is developing in the two countries.7. During discussions between vice-prime minister Tian Jiyun and vice-president Masliukov, Iurii D. Masliukov, First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers there was an agreement [reached] on convening, this July in Moscow, the annual session of the Mixed Technical-Scientific Commission. Both sides expressed interest in developing exchanges in the border regions and in cooperating in [the field of] industry, transport, energy and creating [a] task-force (assigurarii fortei de munca), but no concrete proposals were made. 8. The foreign ministers concentrated, mainly, on reaching agreement on the contents of the final communique (negotiated previously by deputy foreign ministers and [bureau directors]. Due to time constraints, the problem of the Korean Peninsula was succinctly touched upon, as was the situation in Afghanistan. The Soviet side also briefly informed [the Chinese] on the conversations with the US Secretary of State [James A. Baker].9. In conclusion, [Dai Bingguo] emphasized, the [Sino-Soviet] Summit will enhance the development of bilateral relations between the two countries in all aspects. Similar meetings between the two leaderships will continue. Of course, Deng Xiaoping will not visit the USSR; he no longer has foreign visits as part of his role. At the same time, there [still] exist complex problems which need resolving. Evidently, it is not possible to resolve all [these problems] in just one high-level meeting. The Chinese government is conscious that new problems and frictions might emerge, [considering that] divergences [of opinion] are normal. [However, it considers that] the resolution of those problems must be undertaken in the spirit of the five principles of peaceful co-existence, [which will] insure the healthy development of bilateral relations.

      "Version 1Draft. (Dictated on 4 September 1958)At the end of 1948 there was an exchange of opinions with Mao Zedong about his visit to Moscow. Such a visit was appropriate, and there was readiness to receive him to discuss questions regarding the Chinese revolution and Sino-Soviet issues. At the time military operations of the Chinese Communists were developing at a fast pace and in the favorable direction; decisive battles were being fought in northern China, and it was clear that a revolutionary government would be formed in the liberated territory. Therefore, at a meeting of the CC [Central Committee] Politburo, when the question of replying to Mao Zedong concerning the timing of his visit was being discussed, Stalin expressed the consideration that it was probably inappropriate to have Mao Zedong visit now, when he is in the role of a party leader [because] he, probably, would need to come incognito. This would pull him away from leading events on the ground at a decisive moment. It would be more appropriate to postpone his visit by a few months, i.e. until the moment when the Chinese revolutionary government is formed, in which case he would be able to come as the head of the Chinese revolutionary government. But so as not to postpone the discussion of current questions of interest to the Chinese comrades, it was deemed appropriate to send one of the Politburo members to China for discussion of necessary questions with Mao Zedong and the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party. At this meeting on January 14, 1949 Stalin dictated a draft telegram to Mao Zedong (attached), where he expressed the motives for the appropriateness of the delay of his visit to Moscow until a government is formed in China, where it was said that the CC VKP(b) [All-Russia Communist Party (Bolsheviks)] was ready to send a responsible member of the Politburo to discuss questions. After some time we received the agreement of Mao Zedong to this proposal. Stalin proposed that I go to China, to which I, of course, gave my agreement. In order to have minimal difficulties during the talks in China and be better prepared I jotted down a list of possible questions, which the Chinese could raise before us, thought about possible answers on my part and asked Stalin, not at the meeting, but one-on-one, to hear me out as to what questions could be raised by the Chinese, and how I plan to answer them, and whether it would be correct, and how to do it better. I motivated it by the fact that it would be difficult to continuously ask for Moscow’s instructions every time the Chinese raise a question before us during the talks. It would be good, for those questions that can be foreseen, to have a position ahead of time, whereas the unforeseen and other questions can be agreed upon through the cypher communications, and resolved in the course of the discussions. Stalin agreed and we discussed with him for more than an hour these 17 questions, which were jotted down by me. This list of questions survived (attached). The Chinese, of course, gave their agreement to my visit and pointed out the place of possible landing of the Soviet plane (former Japanese aerodrome, captured by the Communists near Shijiazhuang). It was agreed that no one should know about my trip to China. I left on January 26, 1949 from Moscow on the Si-47 plane. Stalin was personally interested in who would be my interpreter. He was afraid lest this be a politically unreliable person. Therefore he entrusted [Georgii] Malenkov to find a reliable Chinese interpreter through the CC apparatus. CC offered the candidacy of [E.] Kovalev who was a worker in the CC apparatus [responsible] for China. I asked him to come over so as to talk to him and receive his agreement to the trip to China. He began to refuse. First, he said that he does not speak Chinese fluently and proposed that instead of him I take c. [Nikolai] Fedorenko, who used to work in the USSR Embassy in China. I did not know c. Fedorenko at the time, whereas Malenkov gave a good recommendation for Kovalev and I decided to insist on the trip of Kovalev instead of replacing him with Fedorenko, otherwise Stalin could incorrectly judge this and treat it with suspicion. I started to ask what other motives Kovalev had for refusing the trip, other than his knowledge of Chinese. I thought that he was objecting out of modesty – probably he knew the language. Then he started to cite some kind of family circumstances, that he wanted to get married or something like that. I said that this cannot be ruled out, that we are going on a trip of no longer than one week, and he’ll have the time to do that. Then he started saying that he cannot fly in an airplane. I began to shame him, a young worker of the CC: how can a young party member keep his face when refusing this matter, [when] an older comrade is planning to fly and is not afraid. After considerable pressure he, at last, was forced to agree and was marked down to come along with me. Then Stalin proposed to take along the former Minister of Railways [Ivan] Kovalev who was at some point removed from that position for some household omissions (it seems, the building of a dacha). Stalin proposed then to judge him in the court of honor but it was later cancelled. Stalin asked to take him along so that he learns something, and later send him to China as our representative with the Chinese CC. Kovalev was poorly prepared politically, and did not have the appropriate experience and preparedness, but he was a good man. This is how it was done. In China there were two doctors at the time, attached to Mao Zedong – workers of the Soviet army. They treated Mao Zedong and his wife and maintained the liaison. They had a small radio, through which they maintained liaison with Khabarovsk. One of these doctors, the Communist Terebin [Andrei Orlov], who had the main role, later died in an air crash while returning from a vacation in Sochi. The other doctor was Mel’nikov, who was not a party member, and did not have great significance. They had a cypher. They could encode and decode [messages], and we had to use that. On the way we spent the night in Chita, where we arrived at 6 in the evening. The secretary of the Oblast Committee Golubov greeted us. At 1am we flew onward. Stalin proposed a pilot for this responsible trip, a talented civilian pilot, now major general Grachev. The Siberian route was then poorly equipped. Grachev was an experienced, talented pilot and delivered us in Khabarovsk all and well. We were greeted by [Rodion] Malinovsky, the head of the [military] district, and by others. I was travelling under the banner of a trip for fishery-related affairs in the Kurile Islands and Kamchatka, formally. This is what I told Malinovsky and the others. So they knew that from the port I took the direction of Port Arthur. I did not tell them but they guessed about [the real purpose of] my trip. It was agreed that in Port Arthur no one must know about my trip except for the commander of the aviation corpus because Belov was instructed not to inform. When we arrived in Port Arthur, we were put up at a former Japanese dacha. We had to wait for 24 hours, while communications were being established. At the time we were supposed to fly across the Zhili bay in the vicinity of the city of Sh…… [sic], which is to the Southeast of Beijing (400-500 km). The Soviet fighter planes accompanied our plane until the territory of Eastern China. At the time there was an American naval airbase in Qingdao, with radar, which we were to fly by at [the distance of] 100 km. Therefore, there was a danger that they could intercept and down us. Moreover, at the time Taiyuqin [sic; ed. note—perhaps Taiyuan] was encircled (so to speak), the Americans were providing the besieged with help and American planes flew to this region across the liberated Chinese territory. Therefore we hedge-hopped so as to avoid the orbit of the locator rays, so that the Americans do not capture a Soviet plane over Chinese territory. It was agreed that there would be a fire burning on the aerodrome. We searched briefly, waited, then, finally, fire was lit, and Grachev landed very successfully. There were Chinese guerillas on the aerodrome. The aerodrome was not operational but the landing strip was in order. We were met on the aerodrome by the doctors, Zhu De, Ren Bishi, Shi Zhe. The plane was immediately dispatched to the region of Dalian, as it was feared that the Americans would bomb the plane on the aerodrome. We agreed that when it was necessary the plane would fly to the same place. From there, in a trophy Willys [Jeep], captured by the Communists from the chiangkaishekists, we proceeded to the main headquarter of the party CC and the revolutionary committee – Xinxibo [sic, should be Xibaipo]. This was about 160-170 km from the airport, in a mountain canyon. Approximately half the road the landscape was more or less flat, very dusty. They said that it had not rained for about two months, it was dry. It was not cold, a bright winter sun was shining. They said that it was the Chinese New Year, which will last for 5-6 days, and the Chinese had the custom of paying visits from village to village. Especially all the married girls visit their parents on this day. A large crowd of bypassers was lightly dressed. Clothes made from white calico, pants and shirt. The majority – barefooted. There was a lot of dust, so many had their mouths and noses protected by gauze masks. Many carried children in their arms. Very rarely we came across coaches with a horse or one buffalo. This was a rare exception. I was struck by the fact that there were family cemeteries everywhere with coniferous, evergreen trees planted over. And this is when China is lacking land. The lack of common cemeteries and the existence of family cemeteries does damage to the peasantry. This is a fact that strikes. In one of the towns near to Xinxibo [sic, Xibaipo], which we passed, I was struck by another fact. At the point of entry of the town, there are 7-8 lavatories on either side of the gates, made from baked brick, which belong to private owners. The profit is that the owners use the feces from these lavatories to fertilize fields. The more the fertilizers the better the harvest. So in pursuit of fertilizers they built a lot of lavatories, more than needed, and this is striking. On the market they were selling some kinds of nut, winter varieties of pear, some sweets from nuts and peanuts. Nothing more. The poverty was great, and there were a lot of people. On the way we stopped for a break. Com. Zhu De treated us. We prepared tea in an ordinary tin teapot. We drank tea and ate the local winter varieties of pear, very juicy. With tea we were served Chinese-made candy instead of sugar. The Chinese drink tea without sugar, and the candy were carried especially for us. We were served black tea, and not green, which the Chinese usually drink. In the afternoon we arrived at our destination, [and] I was taken to a peasant house where Mao Zedong lived. Houses had flat roofs, with about two rooms, with a yard, which was surrounded by a tall fence in the oriental style. [Mao’s] house was made of clay, the yard was small, 1-2 trees had been planted, so one could walk about. This is where Mao Zedong met us. He worked in one room, which was something like his office, where members of the Politburo gathered. This is where we had our first meeting. Windows had no glass. There was oiled paper, and the whole village was like that. Therefore the rooms were lit badly. Instead of the door there was a curtain, a kind of a quilted blanket, which had to be raised in order to enter. It left many gaps, therefore such a curtain does not protect from cold that much. His rooms were unheated. He went about in a half-length coat (sheep skin on the inside, cloth on the outside), also warm trousers. I had to sit and talk with a coat over my shoulders – it was that cold. The adjacent room had Mao Zedong’s family – wife and daughter, whom we saw and became acquainted with in the evening, when [we?] were invited to a supper together with the members of the Politburo. A different house was reserved for us – two rooms. I was in one room, c. Kovalev was in the other one. Then, the main work was to put together telegrams and cyphers. These houses are like Korean fanzas. The heating is under the floor. In addition, they added pig iron stoves inside the rooms, so that we don’t feel cold due to not being accustomed. It was comfy, good, warm. I stayed there for 9 days. I had a plan to finish matters in 7 days and to leave but when the time for departure came, Mao Zedong started to ask that I stay for another 2-3 days, so that we have more conversations, although in essence everything was finished and one could sense it, but in view of Mao Zedong’s insistence I informed Moscow and received agreement to stay for another two days, as Mao Zedong requested. I was struck by one circumstance in the conditions of work and livelihood of the leading comrades of the Chinese Communist Party. In Moscow we suffered from Stalin’s habits. He went to bed at 4-5 o’clock in the morning. During the summer he got up a bit earlier, 12-2 in the afternoon, in the middle of the day, but usually – at 6 or 7 in the evening. But as our [government] agencies work normally, and as Stalin invited us every day to join him for supper at night, and we had to be at work at least by 11-12am, so it was a big burden. One can go without enough sleep for 1-2 days but it’s impossible systematically. We suffered a lot, because one could not fail to come to work. On the other hand, one could not fail to come to Stalin, or to leave early. We had an inescapable, difficult situation. I never supposed that the Chinese comrades are in the same situation here, in the mountains. But it turned out that Mao Zedong stays up until 4-5 in the morning, gets up at 2-3 in the afternoon. Therefore he said that the conversations will take place daily starting from 4 in the afternoon, and in the morning the talks will be conducted by Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, and others, on various questions. I finished conversations with Mao usually at night, at 12-1 o’clock at night, I had the most regular living pattern [rezhim], which one could never attain in Moscow. I got up at 8-9 in the morning, often walked about in the mountains. Our village was in a mountain canyon. There were about 10 minor villages within the radius of half-a-kilometer. One of the meeting was scheduled for ten in the morning. I waited for Zhou Enlai for about half an hour, did not know what the problem was. After arrival he immediately began to apologize: he was late because he only finished his conversation with Mao Zedong at 5 in the morning and did not get enough sleep, he just barely got up. I asked him – is this the first time or is it a common phenomenon? He said that this is how it usually was. I understood the situation of Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, and others, and thought how difficult it was for them to handle this pattern [rezhim].Members of the Politburo Zhou Enlai, Liu Shaoqi, Zhu De (Taibi /?/) [sic], [and] Ren Bishi were present at conversations with Mao Zedong. On our part, both Kovalevs were present at conversations. There was an embarrassment with our interpreter [E.] Kovalev. As soon as we began the conversation with Mao Zedong, suddenly the interpreter Kovalev could not interpret, started stammering. I asked what the problem was. He said that Mao Zedong spoke with a Beijing dialect [sic, in fact Hunan], and he studied the Shanghai [dialect]. I was in a silly situation. It was good that Mao Zedong’s secretary was Shi Zhe, who met us at the aerodrome. He knew Russian wonderfully. True, he had a strong accent, and it did not come out too well in Russian, but the meaning was conveyed excellently. He lived in Russia for almost 16 years, worked in the organs of the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs, sic, in fact NKVD]. In Moscow he left a Russian wife and two children. So he became the interpreter, which was, of course, inconvenient. We did not have our own interpreter, as Stalin had wanted. But there was no loss, because Shi Zhe was an honest interpreter. I instructed Kovalev to write down the content of the conversations. But he had no experience. Therefore, no full record of the conversations was left. During the conversations with Mao Zedong, we were constantly served tea in Chinese ceramic cups with tin lids. Mao Zedong continuously walked about the room, sipped the tea and when the tea ran low the servant added [more] tea. The others were served tea as well. He smoked a lot. He was calm [and] reserved. Sometimes he got carried away, spoke with inspiration. The first two days he introduced [us] to the course of history of the Chinese revolution and the fractional struggle within the Chinese Communist party. Then, in later meetings, he also occasionally returned to these questions of the history of the Chinese Communist Party, how difficult it was for him to struggle against the leftist and the rightist deviations, how the party was broken due to the activity of Wang Ming, and the army was decimated, how the mistakes were then corrected, how these fractionists destroyed the cadres of the Chinese Communists, and that he barely made it out alive, he was arrested, they wanted to destroy him, but since the time when they managed to expose Wang Ming and Wang Jiaxiang, he is working well with his comrades, put an end to the destruction of the party cadres, he was and remains a supporter of tolerance within the party, one should not expel from the CC for differences, one should not prosecute. For instance, Wang Ming who played a bad role is on the CC and stays in the region of CC headquarters, though he does not do any work but in fact he remains a member of the CC. He spoke in great detail about the mistakes of Wang Ming. It seems that he wanted to check, how we feel about him, whether we are attempting to rely on him and to listen to his advice. Before my departure from Moscow Stalin told me about their [Mao’s] differences with Wang Ming, and that one should not meet with him. I did not want to meet with Wang Ming and did not make any attempt to do it.Then the conversation turned to the theme of contemporary questions. The main things that deserved attention at the time, was recounted by me in cyphers to the CC. We had a small radio, one person did the encoding, so we had a very limited volume of exchange. We reported the main things that could interest our CC, and had a great significance for our Politburo. On some questions I asked for instructions from Moscow, and, one should say, that I precisely immediately received responses to my questions. Later, when I returned, comrades told me that at the meetings every day Stalin read my cyphers aloud and they were discussed, therefore in essence every time, when this was needed, I received necessary answers to questions. Regarding the question of attitude towards the Americans and the English there were divergences in the conversations between the advice given by Stalin before [my] departure and the opinion of Mao Zedong. And it was already clear that Mao Zedong was more correct here than Stalin. And now this is all the more clear. Stalin used to say that one should not immediately sharpen relations with the Americans, that the Chinese Communists should direct the sharp points of [their] weapons against the English, because they are a colonial power, which is occupying Chinese territory – Hong Kong, and are, of course, pursuing imperialistic interests, which are at variance with the Chinese national interests. American imperialism, by contrast, has almost no colonies, especially in China. It acts by other means: dollars, economic and political enslavement, and not by means of direct colonial robbery. From the general point of view, this argument is correct. Moreover, Stalin added [Franklin D.] Roosevelt reasoning, who spoke out against colonial powers and colonial possessions, who believed that colonies should be liquidated, so that there is economic competition, free trade and so on. This corresponded to the interests of the Americans, as America appeared on the world market when all colonies had already been distributed, and with the liquidation of the colonial system, the Americans could find their way into all markets, which is what happened outside the borders of the socialist camp. Now America is squeezing out and taking over positions of the French, the English, and other imperialist states. Stalin based himself on this concept. When he told me about this in Moscow, I thought he was saying the right thing. But when I spoke about this to Mao Zedong, he brought forward other, more convincing arguments and first and foremost one particularity that Stalin did not take into consideration and which was taken into consideration by Mao Zedong. Mao Zedong said that in general this is, perhaps, correct, but keeping in mind the concrete situation of China, this will be incorrect, because American imperialist supports Chiang Kaishek, invested so much money in Chiang Kaishek’s reactionary regime, that the Americans are unlikely to reconcile themselves to Chiang Kaishek’s defeat, they will continue to support him. Therefore the Chinese Communists must direct their sharp points against American imperialism, because this is the greatest danger. They did not consider the English to be the main danger. The argument that England is occupying Hong Kong is a serious one. But the Chinese did not want to take it, they wanted to leave it for a time, to exercise patience with England’s possession of Kong Kong, they believed the English will treat them better. This will deter the English. Stalin was trying to get the Chinese to defeat Chiang Kaishek and capture Hong Kong. Our discussion continued well so I did not engage in sharp argument, and when he recounted his position, and I did not insist on mine, because [his] arguments in this particular case were correct. On a series of other questions, on which I will touch below, I thought then and think today that Mao Zedong did not have a completely correct position but [then] adopted a more correct position. This concerns, first, that to my question when Mao Zedong thinks to capture the main industrial centers of China – Nanjing, Shanghai, etc. – he said that he was not in a hurry to do that, it seems that he said that one needed 2-3 years for attaining victory (compare with the cyphers that reflect this).With this he cited the argument that they were avoiding taking large cities, but are trying to capture countryside regions. For instance, they do not want to take Shanghai. Shanghai is a large city but the Chinese Communist Party has no cadres. The Communist Party is mainly made up of peasants, in Shanghai the Communist organization is weak. Finally, Shanghai is a province, it uses imported materials and fuel. And if they capture Shanghai, there will be no supply of fuel, the industry will stop, there will be unemployment, which will worsen the situation of the population. They need to prepare cadres, which they started at one point. When the cadres are ready they will occupy Shanghai and Nanjing. I challenged him: first, the faster they occupy the cities the better – cadres will grow up in the struggle. Sooner or later the question about materials for Shanghai will come up. But the occupation of Shanghai will seriously weaken Chiang Kaishek, give a proletarian basis to the Communists. Secondly. It seemed to me that Mao Zedong did not pay sufficient attention to the significance of the proletarian layer in the membership of the Communist Party, and [his] attention to the city and to the working class was weaker than to the peasantry, that these were old mistakes, when the Communist Party and the Army were operating in the mountains, far from workers’ centers, but now the time has changed, but the attitude towards workers remains the same. Perhaps add:One can see from the memoranda of conversations that, for instance, Mao Zedong “stressed with satisfaction that the Communist Party enjoys undivided loyalty in the countryside, it has no competitors there. In this the Communists were aided by Chiang Kaishek by his policy with regard to the peasantry. Cities are a different matter. Here, whereas among the students, the Communist Party has strong influence, among the working class the Guomindang is stronger than the Communist Party. For instance, in Shanghai, after the victory over Japan, when the Communist Party operated legally, its influence extended to about 200 thousand workers out of 500 thousand – the rest followed the Guomindang.”Characteristic in this respect was also this statement by Mao Zedong: “The Chinese peasants are more conscientious than all American and many English workers.”Further, guided by Stalin’s instruction, I was trying to persuade Mao Zedong not to postpone the formation of a revolutionary government of China, to create it quickly, on the basis of a coalition, which will be profitable. Say, after the capture of Nanjing or Shanghai, to proclaim the new revolutionary government of China. This would be profitable in the international respect, after this they would act not as guerillas but as a revolutionary government, and this would facilitate the subsequent struggle with Chiang Kaishek. Mao Zedong believed that one should not be in a hurry to create a government, he said that they were better off without a government, if there is a government, there will be a coalition, and this means that one has to hold oneself to account before other parties for one’s actions, and this will introduce complications, and for now they were acting as a revolutionary committee, which did not depend on parties, though they maintained liaison with them. This helped to clear the country from the counterrevolutionary elements. So they were not in a hurry to move to Beijing, but I was telling him that it was necessary to move to Beijing as soon as possible. He insisted in this matter (compare the record with the cypher). I should note that Stalin told me before my departure that one should take along a specialist in secret bugging devices, because he assumed that the Americans before they leave Beijing, will leave a spy network, and will have secret bugging devices in the buildings occupied by the government, and everything that will be said at the meetings will be known to them. In order to prevent this from taking place, he sent with me two specialists in uncovering the presence of bugging devices, and also disguised time bombs. A few days after the talks began I introduced our specialists Levkin and Podovinnikov. Mao Zedong was very glad, thanked Stalin, saying that in terms of uncovering bugging devices they had no experience whatsoever. Just about that time Beijing was liberated, so then I offered that before the government moves to Beijing, our specialists would go to Beijing and check all the offices, which were to be taken over by the government, from the point of view of presence of bugging devices. Mao Zedong sent his eldest son with them. He was brought up in Russia and spoke good Russian. He went to Beijing with our comrades to check the government buildings. Stalin always had a spymania, thought there were spies all around, that they can get into every place, do anything; he feared that there were American and English spies close to the Chinese leadership, and he gave me the instruction to find out if there were any Americans or Englishmen near the Chinese. He instructed me to check seriously, to find out, and to report. I asked our two comrades who were there. They said that there were two Americans, one of whom – [Sidney] Rittenberg – worked in the editing office of the central [publishing] organ of the Chinese Communist Party CC, had been with the Communist Party for several years – 2 or 3 years, and the other – professor – lived in some city and conducted scientific work (medicine or agriculture). They both benefited from good attitude of the Chinese leadership, enjoyed trust, etc. I conveyed this information to Moscow. I received an instruction from Stalin to report to Mao Zedong about this and advise to arrest the Americans as obvious spies. I, of course, carried out everything to the letter. Mao Zedong asks: where did we get this, he knows them as honest people. I began to challenge [him], he said: how do you know they are spies, we don’t have [such] information, this cannot be true – in a word [I] was trying to persuade him, etc. I could never persuade him, and I reported to Moscow about this, and received a new instruction, to insist. I went for the second time, the Chinese were not pleased, did not understand us, why we had to interfere in their concrete affairs, why we were more interested than the Chinese themselves. This made an unfavorable impression on them. On the other hand, I had a firm instruction from Stalin. This introduced some kind of coolness into our conversations, but other conversations were in a very good, comradely tone. The Americans were not arrested before my departure. But then they thought that Stalin would get offended, and arrested them. And only after Stalin’s death we informed the Chinese that we don’t have any information and any rationale for keeping them under arrest. Of course, I said that there was an instruction from Moscow but did not complain about Stalin, but defended my position myself. But all of that left an unfavorable impression [nepriyatnyi osadok] on Mao Zedong. I was not sure about my own rightness, but I had to do what I had been instructed to do by the CC. About Port ArthurMao Zedong said that he had been visited by one woman – a bourgeois politician – who raised the question to the effect that when the revolutionary government of China comes to power, the Soviet Union will not have any reason to keep the military-naval base at Port Arthur, and that for China to return this base would a great thing. Mao Zedong said that this is incorrect, that we are Communists and this does not rule out, but actually allows, that there be a Soviet base in Port Arthur. Therefore, they, the Chinese Communists, stand for keeping this base in place. The American imperialism sits in China for oppression, but the Soviet Union sits in Port Arthur for protection from Japanese fascism. When China is sufficiently strong that it can protect itself from Japanese aggression, then the USSR will itself no longer need the base in Port Arthur. Stalin, in my opinion, understood this opinion perfectly well. He said that we consider that one does not need a base in Port Arthur if the government of China is Communist. In his telegram for Mao Zedong dated February 5, 1949, he declared: “... With the coming to power of the Chinese communists, the situation in the country cardinally changes. The Soviet government has made a decision to cancel this unequal treaty and withdraw its forces from Port Arthur as soon as the peace with Japan had been signed and, as consequently, American forces leave Japan. But if the Chinese Com[munist] Party considers it expedient to have the forces withdrawn immediately, the USSR is prepared to carry out this wish of the CCP.”Mao Zedong insisted on his way, though I knew even before that he was incorrect but I thought that, maybe, he is doing it for tactical reasons. About XinjiangThis question also has interest (check the telegram on this matter). Mao Zedong introduced the proposal to build a railroad between China and the USSR across Xinjiang or, as Ren Bishi offered, across Mongolia. Later, when this question was being discussed in Moscow, Stalin expressed himself to the effect that the road should be built across Mongolia, because it was already a people’s republic, and it was shorter and cheaper, and in second turn, to build the road across Xinjiang.***Mao Zedong said all the time that they were waiting for instructions, leadership, and help from the CC CPSU. I replied that the CC of our party cannot interfere in the activity of the CC of the Chinese Communist Party, each of our parties is independent, we can only offer advice, when we are asked for it, but we cannot give instructions. Mao Zedong persevered, he said that he was waiting for instructions and leadership from our CC, because they have little experience, he purposefully understated his role, his significance as a Marxist and as a leader, he said that he was just Stalin’s pupil, that he does not attach significance to his theoretical works, as he did not bring anything new to Marxism, etc. This, I think, was an oriental manner of showing timidity but this did not correspond in reality to what Mao Zedong was, and what he thought about himself. I understood it then, and understand it now, and Stalin understood this well, when this was reported to him. During the daytime there were several conversations on economic, financial [and] agricultural questions, on questions of China’s transport. We wanted to find out what is happening in China, how they manage… [sic, the remainder of the document is missing]. \n",

      "Secret[to the] CPSU CCYesterday, 16 September, [we] invited the Korean delegation to our place; they did not request to [come] to us themselves.In this conversation we had the goal of obtaining information. The Korean delegates limited themselves to several obviously previously memorized phrases to explain what had happened there at the KWP plenum.It was evident that they are avoiding going beyond the bounds of the instructions they have received and it is essentially useless to discuss the situation in the Party with them. A record of the conversation with the Korean delegation is being sent separately via VCh.Therefore it will not be possible to fulfill the CC instruction concerning the issues relating to the Korean Worker's Party in Peking. Summoning Kim Il Sung and the other Politburo members here might turn out to be impractical.It is not excluded that Kim Il Sung does not want to come there, especially since there is information that he has declared himself sick. The Koreans might consider departure of other Politburo members from the country difficult.Therefore, essentially the only means for a discussion of the situation in the Korean Worker's Party is to go to Pyongyang for a day or two with representatives of the CC of the Communist Party of China after an exchange of opinions with the Chinese comrades and discuss this issue there.If there are no other instructions from the CC, we will act accordingly.A.

      "[handwritten:Top SecretPriority][to the] CPSU CCToday, 22 September, a meeting was held commission concerning the draft resolution of the plenum with a commission of the Korean Worker's Party CC presidium. [We] met in a small group in accordance with Cde. Kim Il Sung's request. On the Korean side were commission members Cdes. Kim Il Sung, Kim Du-bong, Choe Yong-geon, Kim Chang-man, and Nam Il, who translated into Russian, and there were Cdes. Peng Dehuai together with Shi Zhe, myself, and Ambassador Ivanov.Cde. Kim Il Sung passed [us] the draft CC plenum [handwritten: decision] drawn up by them for publication, which is attached below.I and Cde. Peng Dehuai said that the draft agrees with what [we] had said earlier and is basically acceptable insofar as it refers to the revocation of the organizational conclusions of the previous plenum.I said that it was necessary to add provisions to the draft about the need to practice intra-Party democracy, criticism and self-criticism, and a patient attitude toward mistaken comrades. The Korean comrades agreed to add decisions about this with the appropriate provisions.I also told the Korean comrades that besides this draft decision for the CC plenum it is still necessary to prepare proposals for the presidium about state or other work to which the rehabilitated comrades would be assigned. While this was being done proceed from the position that to return them to [their] previous work or to give them new work appropriate to their position or capabilities. This is first and second, and it is also necessary to revoke other decisions of the CC presidium which provided for the removal of senior officials from [their] posts for reasons of intra-Party differences. The Korean comrades agreed with this.I asked Cde. Kim Du-bong whether he had been informed of our conversations in his absence and how he regarded all this. He said that he had been informed and was very satisfied and grateful that the delegations had come from the fraternal Parties and had given great help with their valuable advice, and that he was pleased that the KWP CC presidium had agreed with our advice, and added that evidently [the following] had been coordinated with Cde. Kim Il Sung: little time remained for preparing the CC members for the plenum, and therefore the plenum ought not to open today, but tomorrow, in order to have an opportunity to be able to inform CC members about the decisions being planned. Cde. Kim Il Sung added that yesterday CC Presidium members had individual conversations with the CC members located in Pyongyang. The conversations showed that some comrades agreed with the proposals and others, knowing the people whom this concerns in a negative sense, did not agree, but yet others suggested adopting [inserted by hand: them] on the condition that the people expelled from the CC provide sharp self-criticism for their mistakes at the plenum. Cde. Kim Il Sung suggested that the plenum be postponed to tomorrow in order to be able to explain the draft decision to CC members who had arrived from the provinces. He justified this by the fact that it was desirable that the plenum be held without dissention. We naturally agreed. It was agreed to open the plenum on the morning of the 23rd. Judging from everything the plenum should be concluded the same day. If the plenum ends on time before dark we will fly to Peking tomorrow, and to Moscow from Peking on the 24th of September.[handwritten: signed] A.

      "[handwritten: Top Secret[[to]] Moscow [[to the]] CPSU CC]On the evening of 22 September a new conversation was held with the Korean comrades [inserted by hand: at the initiative of Cde. Kim Il Sung]. Present at the conversation were Mikoyan, Mukhitdinov, Ponomarev, and Cdes. Kim Il Sung and Nam Il. The conversation lasted from 9 P.M. to 2 A. M.Initially the Korean comrades consulted about several economic issues. Replies were given to this in accordance with the recommendations given by the CPSU CC concerning the five-year plan. Cde. Kim Il Sung again stressed the great importance of the restoration of the chemical works to full capacity, pointing out that they needed the fertilizer to increase agricultural production. We again confirmed that everything will be done concerning which there was an agreement in Moscow. We also said that the development of local production which does not have local enterprises which do not require large capital investment - the mining of salt, the development of fishing, etc. - has great importance for the DPRK.Then the Korean comrades showed us a new draft of a CC plenum resolution in which our wishes and comments [inserted by hand: and additions] about the need to add to the initial draft resolution instructions were taken into consideration about the need to ensure that the Leninist norms of Party life were followed in the KWP and the incorrectness of using organizational and administrative measures in the management of the Party. [handwritten: against a sizeable group of CC members Party personnel].As a result of the discussion of a draft resolution during the conversation the Korean comrades will submit to the plenum a more comprehensive resolution compared to the initial draft. The following section has been added to the draft resolution previously sent by us:\"All Party organizations should consistently carry out the tasks presented in the resolution 'The Report of the Work of the Government Delegation Which Visited the Fraternal Countries and Some Immediate Tasks of Our Party' adopted at the August plenum and should especially pay serious Party attention to the correction of the mistakes of comrades with patient educational work and by convincing them.At the same time they should [inserted by hand: it is necessary] to create an atmosphere promoting a more lively, organized discussion of the issues which arise in Party life and even if incorrect questions arise, then approach the correct conclusions by an investigation of the truth and a broad development of a discussion and criticism, without resorting to organizational and administrative methods.Party organizations should consistently launch a struggle to further expand and develop intra-Party democracy, and strengthen criticism and self-criticism inside the Party, especially criticism from below. All Party organizations should strengthen the unity and initiative of the Party masses still further\".During the conversation we openly described the CPSU CC opinion about the incorrect conclusions methods often permitted in work by the KWP CC leadership. [We] pointed to the fact that the main task right now is in rallying the ranks of the KWP together on the basis of an ideological and principled line. Such ideological solidarity cannot be achieved by repressive measures and by cutting off more and more senior personnel. Cde. Kim Il Sung stated that he completely agreed with this CPSU CC advice, that he understands the incorrectness of many steps made by the KWP leadership and which came down to the frequent use of administrative methods in the work of the KWP. Essentially, he said, it needed to be admitted that only just now is the KWP CC understanding the substance of the 20th CPSU congress line. There was no such understanding during the preparations for and the holding of the 3rd KWP congress. If we held the 3rd congress right now then it would proceed on the basis of large-scale self-criticism, and that would provide an opportunity to correct the shortcomings which exist in the work of the KWP and give the Party a correct approach to putting Leninist Party principles into effect from bottom to top. The 7th congress of the Communist Party of China, [handwritten: said Kim Il Sung], was quite instructive in this regard. We see how the Chinese Party is drawing the correct, deep conclusions from the line defined by the 20th CPSU congress.In turn, we stressed the great importance of the 7th CCP congress and said that the Korean comrades might derive much use for their own Party from its decisions and documents at the congress.Kim Il Sung noted in connection with this that the Chinese Communist Party has its own great experience, but the Korean Party has no such experience and it has been blindly copying the experience of the CPSU, meaning the cult of personality of Stalin in the process.We again stressed that the CPSU CC and CCP CC intend to support Cde. Kim Il Sung, but for his part he needs to lead the criticism of the shortcomings which exist, ensure their elimination, and correct the mistakes which have been made as a result of the employment of administrative measures against a considerable number of KWP personnel who are honest Communists.Cde. Kim Il Sung declared that he will do everything which depends on him to correct the mistakes which have been made and to ensure the Leninist norms of Party life and the principles of collective leadership in all the activity of the KWP.We said that it is quite important for Cde. Kim Il Sung to say all this in his statement at the CC plenum opening tomorrow.Cde. Kim Il Sung said that he will do so.Considering that the events at the August KWP CC plenum occurred after Cde. Kim Il Sung promised to ensure that the Leninist norms of Party life would be provided in a conversation in the CPSU CC during [his] stay in Moscow, we persistently and repeatedly said that putting the development of intra-Party democracy into real effect, the implementation of collective leadership in the KWP, and the correction of the mistakes which have been made about which he correctly spoke in conversations with the CPSU and CCP delegations, have especially great importance now.After the arrival of these delegations our Parties also felt responsible to some degree for implementing a correct line in all the Party life of the KWP.Cde. Kim Il Sung said that he understands everything which was said to him during the conversation with our delegations. He understands all the responsibility for the situation which has been created and will not permit a repetition of the mistakes.In conclusion we asked, what could we send to the CPSU CC?Cde. Kim Il Sung said:1. He completely agrees with all the advice of the CPSU CC sent by our delegation and with the advice of the CCP CC. He always takes all the advice of the CPSU CC as guidance. The CPSU has indisputable authority for him.2. He assures the CPSU CC that the mistakes like those which were recently made will not be repeated in the KWP any more. Of course, there can be various mistakes in practical work, but there will not be such mistakes as were made at the August plenum.We said that we would pass everything that Cde. Kim Il Sung said to the CPSU Central Committee.In conclusion we said that it is desirable that the KWP CC leadership maintain closer ties with the CPSU CC. It is important that the CPSU CC be informed both about the successes and about the shortcomings in the KWP directly from the KWP CC and from Cde. Kim Il Sung personally.During the conversation we said that a favorable decision about the release of [inserted by hand: former presidium member] Pak Il-u from under arrest is desirable.Cde. Kim Il Sung said that this would be done in the near future.A plenum of the KWP Central Committee was held on 23 September.The CPSU and CCP delegations were present at the plenum. Cde. Kim Il Sung made a report in accordance with the agreement. CC members who spoke supported the proposal submitted by the CC presidium. The plenum adopted a resolution in accordance with Cde.

      "Ciphered Telegram # 13464Tenth Department of the MFA SSSRTop SecretReceived; 19:20 on 4 July 1953Sent: 21:20 on 4 July 1953.To: Beijing, Soviet AmbassadorURGENT [vne ocheredi]1211-1220. Pay a visit to Siu-Tsuan and tell him the following.1.  The Soviet government regards the measures planned by the government of the PRC as correct. The Soviet government is also in agreement with the draft answer to [U.S. General Mark] Clark from Kim Il Sung and Peng Dehuai.2.  The Soviet government believes that the entire course of armistice negotiations testifies to a resolute success of the tactics employed by the Sino-Korean side in these negotiations. The Sino-Korean side demonstrated to the whole world its striving for peace and readiness to conduct negotiations and find the ground for a compromise while protecting their state interests. American ruling circles became isolated in their policy that leaves the blame for the delay of the armistice negotiations and for the continuation of war in Korea in the eyes of the world public opinion at the door of the US.3.  As to Syngman Rhee and his recent provocative actions aimed at complicating the negotiations and at delaying the end of the war, we believe that it is not his independent policy. It is absolutely obvious that all the recent actions of the Syngman Rhee clique and the fuss around them were done in execution of certain tasks set by the US ruling circles which act to please the most aggressive segment of American monopolists. Due to the successful tactics of the Sino-Korean side all the obstacles to the conclusion of an armistice agreement have been removed. This put in a tight corner not only American foreign, but also domestic policy, since there is no more possibility to refer to aggravation of the international situation, to the Korean war, etc. Under the new circumstances the US ruling circles face serious political difficulties in sustaining the atmosphere of military hysteria, high military appropriations, etc. Therefore American ruling circles are taking advantage of Syngman Rhee and the noise around him in order to maintain in the US (and not only in the US) the unstable semi-military political atmosphere and to delay, in one way or another, the conclusion of an armistice. However, the thrust of public opinion in the US as well as in other countries has increased so much that the US ruling circles could hardly manage to put off ending the Korean war for long. This does not exclude that all kind of noise around Syngman Rhee continues and that, perhaps, there would be some new attempts to delay the conclusion of the armistice in Korea.4.  The Soviet government deems it necessary to return to the question about the trip of Kim Il Sung to Punmunjom to sign the armistice agreement. We cannot ignore the defiant conduct of the Syngman Rhee clique, for it may play some kind of dangerous tricks on Kim Il Sung. Therefore, Kim Il Sung should be advised against going to Punmunjom. Instead, he should order another responsible Korean comrade to sign the agreement on behalf of the KPDR. We hope that the Chinese friends will agree with this.Telegraph the results,MOLOTOVCopies: 1 - cde. Malenkov2 - cde. Molotov3. cde. Khrushchev4 - cde. Vyshinsky5 - cde. Gromyko6.- cde.

STALINInasmuch as Vyshinsky has demanded an immediate reply I sent him the following instructions in connection with his telegram Nº 8-10:“1. You ought not engage in extended polemics with Marshall about detailed questions in the first speech in order not to weaken the presentation of the main approach of your speech with details.2. The question of Korea. [You] ought to briefly point to the December agreement of the three governments and to the commitments of the US and USSR to jointly prepare a resolution of the question about the unification of Korea into an independent democratic country and that the new proposal of Marshall is a violation of the commitments which the United States took upon itself, and thus it is incorrect and unacceptable. It stands to reason that when the Americans introduce their new proposals about Korea in the Assembly you will have to give a comprehensive reply and criticism of this proposal.3.

STALINThe work of the Joint Soviet-American Commission on Korea has not advanced in view of the sabotage of the Americans.The 26 August proposal of the Soviet delegation (introduced in response to the 12 August American proposal) in which we agreed with the Americans not to conduct oral consultation with the Korean democratic parties and organizations, but to limit ourselves to studying the written proposals of these parties and organizations already available in the Commission, and also introduced a new proposal about the creation of a Provisional All-Korean Popular Assembly as a consultative body, were rejected by the Americans.Since on 17 September the Soviet delegation proposed beginning the realization of just those provisions of the 26 August Soviet proposals and the 12 August American proposals on which the points of view of both sides were close [Translator’s note: three words apparently containing a reference to a telegram were crossed out at this point] the Americans have not yet given a reply to this, and we ought not await their reply in view of Marshall’s speech in the Assembly with a proposal to include the Korean question on the Assembly’s agenda.Consequently the MFA thinks that the moment has come for the Soviet delegation in the Joint Commission on Korea to make the statement envisioned in the 26 July 1946 directive to the Soviet delegation in the event the American delegation refuses to form a Korean government on the basis of a strict observance of the Moscow decision.[handwritten: It comes to mind that] As is well-known, the following was said at the end of this statement: “The Soviet delegation thinks that the Koreans can be afforded the opportunity to form a government by themselves with the help and participation of the Allies, on condition that American and Soviet troops are withdrawn from Korea. The Soviet delegation declares that if the American delegation agrees with the proposal about the withdrawal of all foreign troops by the end of 1947 or by the beginning of 1948 then the Soviet troops will be ready to leave Korea at the same time as the American troops”.I consider to replace the words  ‘by the end of 1947 or by the beginning of 1948” necessary in the last phrase with the words “by the beginning of 1948”.Such a statement by the Soviet delegation in Seoul will be a good reply to Marshall’s statement and upset his plans in the Assembly.Replying to our inquiry, Shtykov reported that now it would be correct to make such a statement just now.Small changes of wording will be required in the text of Shtykov’s statement, which was approved in the summer of last year, which we could make in the MFA.Of course, right after Shtykov’s speech his declaration will have to published in Seoul and in the USSR [u nas].

During the discussion of the American proposal on Korea in the political committee you ought to make a statement from the very beginning in which you should [develop] [entered by hand: be governed] by the following guidelines:a) The Soviet government has thought and [still] thinks that the question of Korea can be solved on the basis of the 1945 Moscow Agreement.b) However, inasmuch as the US government for some reason has not wanted to agree on this basis the Soviet government with the goal of speeding up [entered by hand: the turning] the reunification of Korea into a single [independent democratic] state, made a new, more radical proposal to the US government, the simultaneous withdrawal from Korea of American and Soviet troops at the beginning of 1948 and granting the Koreans themselves the opportunity to create [entered by hand: a national] government of an [entered by hand and then crossed out: independent democratic] a united Korea.c) In view of the fact that the US government did not desire to accept and this Soviet proposal the Soviet delegation submitted for the discussion of the political committee their proposal about the simultaneous withdrawal from Korea of American and Soviet troops at the beginning of 1948 and granting the Koreans themselves the opportunity of creating [entered by hand: a national] government of a united Korea. At the same time, inasmuch as this Soviet proposal [entered by hand: contained a simpler and more radical solution of the Korean question] the Soviet delegation insisted that the Soviet proposal be discussed in the political committee first, that is, before the American proposal.In any event, you should insist on the Soviet proposal, as a more radical [one], be put to a vote before the American resolution.3. During the consideration of the question of Korea in the political committee you should suggest that representatives of the Korean people of North and South Korea be invited to the discussion of the Korean question. At an appropriate moment you should explain that, as representatives of the Korean people, those actually chosen by the Korean people in North and South Korea should be invited, and not ordinary [people] appointed by the foreign military authorities of Korea.4. Even in the event the political committee switches to the discussion of the American resolution it is necessary to insist [inserted by hand: on an invitation to the Koreans and] that a date for the withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea be set. If the date proposed by us, the beginning of 1948, causes objection then agreement can be given to postponing this date to the middle or the end of 1948 and not seek for the date of the withdrawal of troops be definitely set.Confirm receipt. [Points 5 and 6 entered by hand] 5. If the question of inviting the Koreans is decided favorably it is necessary to insist that the discussion of the Korean question take place in the presence of Koreans from the very beginning, which will mean a postponement of the discussion until the appearance of the Koreans.6. During the discussion of the draft resolution of the Americans, if in the course of the matter this discussion occurs [you] ought to seek the exclusion of the question of outside control over the creation formation of the armed forces of Korea, declaring that the question of the creation of the armed forces of Korea is the business of the national government of Korea and no external forces should interfere in this matter].\n",

      "Telegram from Pyongyang Arrived: 8/27/63 4 : 00 pmProcessed: 8/28/63 8 : 00 amIssued: 8/28/63 8 : 30 amFurther information from BodnerashHaving returned from the PRC with a delegation headed by Choe Yong-geon [Choe Yong Gon], minister Pak Seong-cheol [Pak Song Chol] told Bodnerash that Chinese were showing them only arms factories (10plants). They were boasting that they make 96.5 % of arms themselves. (According to Pak Seong-cheol, common types of weaponry, often obsolete). There were also remarks that the DPRK shares 800 km border with the PRC while only several tens of km with the USSR, and that is even inaccessible mountains or sunken in the sea. Pak Seong-cheol (known for his pro-Chinese bias) was apparently disillusioned and perhaps even intimidated. Bodnerash then expressed his opinion about the PRC leadership – allegedly a band of swindlers deserving only contempt. They have nothing in common not only with Marxism but with conduct of honest people either. There is no dirty trick too low for them. Their goal is world dominance that they expect to achieve with the help of nuclear weapons. That is allegedly the root of their hatred towards the USSR. He says he admires Khrushchev because he has so much patience when dealing with them. “As long as the current leadership of China is at the helm, do not expect it to be any different.” Further details about the visit with KIS (Kim Il Sung): KIS is said to be very upset, especially with the Chinese but also with the USSR. He blames his attitude towards the both on a major disappointment he experienced as early as 1951. While he allegedly went “with a hat in his hand like a beggar” to all our countries and asked for help with building the country, a conspiracy was set up in the DPRK with the help of some high officials of the USSR and the PRC. He allegedly swore that he would never again go begging. The Korean people can lead their country from poverty with their own efforts. Further, he repeated the already relayed facts. Again about KIS, that he is very wise, does not spare his health, travels around the country, directs, helps, gives advice. Supposedly, it is not right to talk about a cult. It is supposedly necessary to see that at stake is Asia that is just awakening from deep feudalism. “Don’t be surprised he is a god for the Korean people; he lead the people from terrible humiliation and oppression.” About the Korean press: That, he says, is irrelevant; it only matters what KIS says.About celebrations of the 15th anniversary of founding of the DPRK: Huge celebrations whose objective supposedly was to strengthen people’s confidence in their own capabilities, and to give them courage for further building. About high participation of foreigners: To show the South Korean people the firm international position of the DPRK, and to neutralize numerous proclamations of Park Chung Hee and other representatives of the military junta in SK that only they are internationally recognized. Supposedly, there is no need to exaggerate participation of Liu Shaoqi. KIS will allegedly be sick again and will not take part. All will happen at the level of Choe Yong-geon. People will supposedly be able to understand the absence of KIS. About the latest attacks of the KWP against the Yugoslavian revisionism: Bodnerash fully agrees with the KWP. A correction of the Moscow declaration hasn’t been done, and Tito did not change in any way either. Allegedly, he knows Tito very well and does not believe he will change. In conclusion he appealed that now an agreement and assignment of tasks among our Embassies is necessary, how to isolate the DPRK from Chinese influence as much as possible, and to strengthen the DPRK’s position in our camp. He emphasized namely the economic aid from China and excursions of delegations of the DPRK professionals to the PRR. He also informed that Korean students are again enrolling in the PRR’s universities this year. I will inform the Soviet friends and after a detailed consultation, I will relay our position.Moravec  93\n",

      "ON THE MEETING OF COMRADE ENVER HOXHA, FIRST SECRETARY OF THE ALBANIAN LABOR PARTY CC WITH THE DELEGATION OF THE FEDERATION OF PROFESSIONAL UNIONS OF KOREA.(On May 7, 1964, before noon, Comrade Enver Hoxha, First Secretary of the ALP CC received at the offices of the CC of the party, the delegation of the FPU of Korea, led by Comrade Li Byeongchan, Chairman of the CC of the Professional Union of the workers of machinery building industries, who took part in the celebration of May 1st, invited by the Central Council of the Professional Unions of Albania. The delegation was accompanied by the Ambassador Extraordinaire and Plenipotentiary of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to the People’s Republic of Albania, An Yong. In the reception, the Member of the Political Bureau of the ALP CC and President of the Professional Unions of Albania, Comrade [Member of the Political Bureau of the ALP CC and President of the Central Council of the Professional Unions of Albania] Gogo Nushi also took part. The translation was conducted into Korean by the translator of the embassy of the DPR of Korea.) Comrade Enver Hoxha: How are you, Comrade Ambassador? How are you, comrades of the professional unions? (“Very well, thank you,” answered the Korean comrades.) We are very happy that the comrades of the professional unions and Comrade Kim Il Sung sent you here, to small Albania, to take part in the celebrations for May 1st.During these past few days you had the chance to see a bit of Albania. Comrade Li Byeongchan: During the past few days we had the chance to visit several cities. We also had meetings with the Albanian people and many Albanian communists.Comrade Enver Hoxha: You come to Albania for the first time. I have also been only once in Korea. When we set up a good travel line, we will be able to come and go more often at each other’s countries.Our people and party have a great love for the Korean people, your heroic party, and for Comrade [General Secretary of the Korean Worker’s Party (KWP)] Kim Il Sung.I have the best impressions from Korea. Your country has made a very good impression on me, because when you get to see something with your own eyes, it is better than reading a hundred reports on it. We see and talk to comrade ambassador very often, but it is different when you actually get to see something. Now, since we follow with the greatest care the successes of the Korean comrades and also get a picture of things from the comrades that visit Korea, I imagine that greater successes must have been achieved there since the time I visited the country. We have read the directives of Comrade Kim Il Sung on the issues of agriculture. They are very good. The issue of the further progress and development of agriculture has been laid out correctly. In those directives there are many points that are useful to us, that open perspectives, and assist us in our work. In these directives one can see the high importance that the Korean Workers’ Party places on the development of agriculture. According to our point of view it must be stressed that in the area of the development of the economy and especially the agriculture when compared to socialist countries, such as our own or Vietnam—but excluding here the countries of popular democracies in Europe, where the revisionists are in power and who are heading for failure—the DPR of Korea has progressed very far. If I am not mistaken, Korea has been able to produce 4 quintals of grains per capita, while we are still very far from such a goal, though we are making good progress. We are very happy that the DPR of Korea, even after the great war and destruction it suffered, has achieved such great successes. Ambassador An Yong: Albania has also brilliant perspectives for the development of agriculture. Comrade Enver Hoxha: It is so. At the time we were in Korea, we noticed that a lot of attention was paid to the agriculture issues and the great investments that were put into irrigation, the increase of chemical fertilizer use, etc. made a great deal of impression on us. Ambassador An Yong: The use of chemical fertilizers is of great importance. Our land, since it has been in use for thousands of years, is much oxidized so it is necessary to use chemical fertilizers.  Comrade Enver Hoxha: You are also well ahead in both the industry and the field of defense. I spoke to the head of the military delegation that came not long ago from Korea. Our military people came back very content from the warm reception they were given by their Korean colleagues. We had no doubt about that because our Korean comrades are our most faithful. They were also very impressed by the strength of the Korean army, its education and armaments, and the defense systems of the country.Ambassador An Yong: Since we are at the forefront of our common enemy, this is very necessary. Comrade Enver Hoxha: It is so, but you still have one side of your country secured by the sister People’s Republic of China, while we are surrounded from all sides here. While you have had to make your defenses in a straight line, in front of the 38th parallel and on the coast, we must build ours as a circle all around us. Why we need you as friends, Korean comrades? You were victorious against American imperialism and the other imperialists because your course is correct. Our country, Albania, is surrounded on all sides by dangerous enemies, but she still resists, builds socialism, and achieves successes because her course if correct. Why do our people love your people, the Korean Workers’ Party and Comrade Kim Il Sung so much? Because today you still follow a correct Marxist-Leninist  course, which embodies to the letter the desires and aspirations of your people and which conforms completely to Marxism-Leninism and the proletarian internationalism, against N. Khrushchev and the other revisionists; because at the lead of your party and people stands our comrade Kim Il Sung. The plots that N. Khrushchev tried to pull on you, he also tried here, but we are now rid of him. Ambassador An Yong: Have you read the full text of the theses of Comrade Kim Il Sung? Comrade Enver Hoxha: No, I have not read the full text of his theses, but only a summary of them. If I am not mistaken, these comprise 20-22 pages.  Ambassador An Yong: When we get the full text, we will make sure to send it to you. Comrade Enver Hoxha: We thank you very much. The comrades of the agriculture and those of the CC have received such materials because they do not deal only with agricultural issues, but also with organizational issues that have to do with the concrete and closer management of agriculture. We have been preoccupied with such matters. We will continue to take measures that generally follow that line. Once we have the full report, we will be able to see how in your country, under the direction of the CC, special courses of action have been set for the regions in matters of agriculture. If I am not mistaken, in the theses of Comrade Kim Il Sung it is mentioned how special regional councils have been created for the management of agricultural issues. You do not have a Ministry of Agriculture, but only a Committee. The approach of committees for agriculture is an interesting one. If we had the full report, we could study this issue closely. Later we may even send an agricultural delegation to Korea in order to see this issue from close by.Ambassador An Yong: We will immediately send over all material we receive on this matter. Comrade Enver Hoxha: We thank you very much. The fact that in the PR of China, after the weather difficulties were overcome, agriculture is progressing well is of high importance to us and the entire international communism. Today we received a telegram by our ambassador to the PR of China where he talks about the visits he has gone to along with the ambassadors of other countries. He writes how the market is everywhere full of foodstuffs; in Beijing there’s plenty of meat, eggs, vegetables, and many other items, while the cities of Sichuan and Hubei not only have plenty of meat, eggs, vegetables, and fruits, but the prices have been decreased by 30%. This is a great success. Ambassador An Yong: The Chinese comrades have now solved the agricultural problem. This is a great success. Comrade Enver Hoxha: It is a great fortune for the entire international communism that we have the CP of China, which follows a correct Marxist-Leninist  line. China has become today the banner of the entire international communism, like the Mount Olympus in Ancient Greece, and it is for this reason that the enemies try to strike it in the head. Ambassador An Yong: For as long as we remain Marxist-Leninist s, this role cannot be denied to China. Not the revisionists are trying to isolate China, but every attempt they make in this direction will fail. The socialist camp cannot continue to exist without the PR of China.  On the chaotic situation that is been going on in the international communist movement we have published an article where we speak about the failure of the plot by the revisionists for the division of the socialist camp. Until now the revisionists have said nothing about this fact, while the Albanian Telegraphic Agency has published it in its news bulletin. Comrade Enver Hoxha: The revisionists have nothing to say about this. Your party’s stance is fully Marxist-Leninist. Should N. Khrushchev dare and say something against the Korean Workers’ Party, it will be catastrophic for him, because he will also have to openly face your cannons. Now N. Khrushchev does not say anything, because he wants to make it look like the Korean Workers’ Party is not in solidarity with China, but those that have read your article understand that all those that are said there about the revisionists are directed at N. Khrushchev and his group. N. Khrushchev and his followers are determined enemies. They all organize the activity against Marxism-Leninism, and against China, Korea, and Albania with all their might. While doing this they progress in the setting of alliances with the American imperialism. At a governmental level, the revisionists will set economic, political, and military alliances with the imperialists, but they will never be successful. Every step they take in this course will be disastrous for them, whether in the economic, ideological, or economic fields. They will face disasters on all sides. They make great efforts to take over the organizations of professional unions. They also won Louis Sayan to their side. In all the international conferences we keep the same position with the Chinese and Korean comrades. Ambassador An Yong: As we also said before, our victory is certain. Comrade Enver Hoxha: Look at our economic successes! We were very happy to see in the theses laid by Comrade Kim Il Sung that you have been able to create such reserves that they allow you to not only move to the area of building homes for the cooperativists in the villages, but to also have the government pay for the homes that the villagers have built on their own. This is a great achievement that has to do with the elimination of the differences between the city and the village. When you start your quarrel with N. Khrushchev, he will accuse you about your Great Leap and will say that what you are doing in Korea is not correct, because he wants you to stop and take steps backward. N. Khrushchev has been dealt colossal failures in agriculture. He is trying to change the soviet agriculture into a capitalist one and to create a polarization of the peasantry; in other words, the rich peasantry, the peasant bourgeoisie comprised of the leaders of the kolkhozes and the sovkhozes on the one side, and the poor peasantry on the other. He wants to bring back that polarization the great Lenin liquidated. Ambassador An Yong: Last year, in all the countries where the revisionist leadership is in power, there was a decrease in agricultural production. Comrade Enver Hoxha: Have you heard about the May 1st demonstrations that took place in Czechoslovakia? Ambassador An Yong: Yes, I have heard about them. Comrade Enver Hoxha: According to the information we have received, there have also been arrests there. Such crises are happening everywhere in the revisionist countries—Poland, Bulgaria, etc. These crises are of ideological, political, and economic nature. A rose that loses its petals, at the end will only be left with thorns. Johnson again today declared that he will continue the economic blockade and the aerial spying over Cuba. From this we may draw the certain conclusion that N. Khrushchev has made concessions to the American imperialists. During the Caribbean [Missile] Crisis, the imperialists must have gotten hold of such a document from N. Khrushchev, that we may never know its importance. There he must have made the concessions on Cuba. Why do we say such a thing? How do we arrive at such a conclusion? Because the American imperialists have been able to wrestle very favorable positions from N. Khrushchev and by not wanting to cause him trouble at the moment, they do not reveal this document, but talk and talk to exert more pressure into him. This declaration by Johnson comes after the recent declaration by N. Khrushchev. On the other hand, today McNamara declared that he is going to Bonn, and that the Americans and the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany are in full agreement that they must take new steps toward the improvement of relations and the strengthening of the friendship with the Soviet Union. In other words, N. Khrushchev is hatching plans in Europe for the sale of Democratic Germany.These are renowned traitors and their people should hang them from the telephone poles. This day will come if not sooner, later. Ambassador An Yong: The more crimes they commit, the more their true faces are unmasked. Comrade Enver Hoxha: What does the weather look like for the agriculture this year in Korea? Ambassador An Yong: We have had a lot of rain so far, but it now seems that we will have good production. Comrade Enver Hoxha: We can also forecast a good year. The spring toiling has gone well and these days we may even finish cotton planting. We finished with the beet planting, the tobacco is progressing well, the corn planting is at a good level, and the wheat is also doing well. We have now undertaken a study on the development of agriculture in hilly and mountainous areas. Toward this goal, we have created specialist teams for every region and at the end of the year, this study will be presented to the Plenum of the CC along with the measures that we should take for the increase of areas that can be irrigated, for the investments that must be done in the enlargement and systemization of the pasture lands, the creation of water wells for the animals, and the further development of hilly and mountainous lands. Our constructions are going very well. The Chinese comrades are extraordinarily punctilious whether in the preparation and delivery of projects, or in the delivery of materials. So we have no problems from their side. If we have any problems, this may only come from our side.  Ambassador An Yong: Taking into account the favorable weather and the good work that your people are doing, we may say that this year you will have plentiful production. The important point here is the issue of bread. Comrade Enver Hoxha: Yes, this is a primary issue. The Chinese comrades have helped us immensely in agriculture and the chemical fertilizer factory because we have no such fertilizer. When the construction of the chemical fertilizer factory ends in 1967, then we will have made a great step forward in the area of agriculture.  But we have also been heavily damaged by the soviet, especially in the last few years. When we severed relations with the soviets, our CC decided to review all the geological studies done by the soviet teams that had visited our country. So we had to go back to all the mineral research places where the soviet specialists had previously worked. For this we had to spend 700 to 800 million leks. In the study reports that the soviet specialists had submitted, it was said that in this place or that there was nothing of value, but now that our own specialists have gone to the same places where the soviets were working, they have discovered copper, chromium, and many other minerals. This means that the soviet specialists had received directives from N. Khrushchev to conduct the research, to discover the minerals, and to not say a word about it to the Albanians, but only notify Moscow. They did this so that when the day came, they would exert economic pressure on us, hatch plots against the Albanian leadership, bring Liri Belishova to power, and whenever the soviets would come to colonize us, they could extract all these minerals and say that the Albanian leadership is “dogmatic,” “anti-Marxist,” and “anti-Albanian,” so it was a good thing we came. This is how lowly they are.  Ambassador An Yong: Their imperialist intentions are also apparent in Romania. It seems that the Romanians will have trouble in the Economic Council now that Albania has been expelled. It is possible that they would be fighting alongside Albania, but now it will be difficult for them. Comrade Enver Hoxha: Yes, it will be hard for them if they do not fight like China, Korea, and Albania do. Let us raise this toast for the brotherhood of our peoples, for the health of our Comrade Kim Il Sung, for your health, dear comrades!..Why don’t you stay a while longer in Albania? We will not give you a return visa and will hold you here.Comrade Li Byeongchan: We have been here only a few days, but we have seen many things during this time. We have had meetings with comrades of the professional unions and with workers. Wherever we went we saw how the Albanian people fight against the blockade by the imperialists and the revisionists. We think that in this area you are achieving miraculous successes by building factories and new additions with your own forces, by producing spare parts, etc. In the cities of Vlora and Stalin City, we met many workers with whom we had many conversations. In Vlora they told us how they had executed the plan for the first quarter of this year and had surpassed it by 112% and they also promised that they will accomplish the yearly plan by the day of the 20th anniversary of liberation. They have achieved good results not only in industry, but also in agriculture. In the agricultural cooperatives we noticed the correct course that is being followed for the production of grains in-country and how the peasant works well for the building of irrigation channels, to open new arable lands, and how everywhere they were opening holes for the planting of grapes and olive trees. In Stalin City we saw how well they worked for the production of agricultural products and fruits. In Vlora we saw how they worked in the municipal sector. In that region the workers had promised to secure their bread in-region within 2-3 years.  In all we saw, we noticed that the Albanian people will make it possible that within two to three years they will fulfill their own needs not only in industry, but also in agriculture.  On the occasion of May 1st we saw that the Albanian people, united as a single body, is ready, under the leadership of the CC of the party, to fight for the construction of socialism, while holding the pickaxe in one hand, and the rifle in the other. In Vlora we saw how they are working not only in the economy, but also in the military field. We became convinced that if the revisionists will try something against Albania, your people are ready to fight against them. We saw the sufficient political, military and ideological preparation needed to throw back under your leadership the imperialists and the revisionists. With these victories it has achieved, the Albanian people will be able to come out victorious in whichever situation it may face. We were immeasurably happy when we saw that the Albanian people have a healthy party and notable leaders. Comrade Enver Hoxha: You work in Pyongyang? (“Yes,” answered the Chairman of the delegation of the FPU of Korea.) They tell me that Pyongyang has been beatified considerably. A lot of changes must have happened since the time I was there. Even at that time Pyongyang was very beautiful, and now, after 8 years, it must be even more beautiful. Ambassador An Yong: You could not recognize Pyongyang. Every day there are new things being built there. Comrade Enver Hoxha: You have a lot of experience in construction. The other cities have also been constructed beautifully for sure.  Ambassador An Yong: In the villages the shacks are also being replaced by modern housing. Last year we built 202,000 modern homes and in two three years the shacks will disappear altogether.  Comrade Enver Hoxha: Your people are hardworking people. I have seen this personally.  Ambassador An Yong: As we intensify our agricultural production, we must build these even faster. Within two three years we will have decreased the difference between the village and the city. Comrade Enver Hoxha: This is a great pleasure. Ambassador An Yong: We will never decrease our enthusiasm. Comrade Enver Hoxha: And do you know what N. Khrushchev will say? “‘The Great Leap,’ ‘the pickaxe in one hand, and the rifle in the other,’ what are these slogans? These are great mistakes.” This is what he will say. Ambassador An Yong: He may call us nationalists and chauvinists, but we will continue to work as we wish. Comrade Enver Hoxha: N. Khrushchev is a chauvinist, and not us. Ambassador An Yong: The delegation of the professional unions of Korea got to see many new things and the great successes that have been achieved in all the areas of economy in your country during this visit. These successes are also in the favor of our country, of Vietnam, and the other countries.  Comrade Enver Hoxha: The successes of each country are everyone else’s. Our joys, grief, and failures are mutual and we share them with each other.  Ambassador An Yong: We are very happy to have been given the chance to have this meeting with you. Comrade Enver Hoxha: Let us drink this toast to the health of our dear Comrade Kim Il Sung!... (“To your health,” answered the Korean comrades)…Make sure you send greetings to the comrades of the professional unions. Tell them that the ALP and the Albanian people are their friends until the end. Comrade Li Byeongchan: It is a great honor for us to have visited Albania and to have had the chance to meet you.(This was the end of the conversation. Then the guests took pictures together.)

      "TELEGRAM 066.609To: the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (to the First and Second Directorates)From: the Romanian Embassy in PyongyangDate: April 3rd, 1978 Classification: SecretReferring to the visit to India of the Korean governmental delegation, led by Gang Ryang-uk, the Vice-President of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (which took place between March 12th-17th) Davinder Singh, the First Secretary of the Indian Embassy in Pyongyang, said in a discussion with Victor Nanu which took place on April 2nd, that the visit took place at the insistent request of the Koreans. D. Singh said that the Indian figures with whom the Korean dignitary held conversations did not ultimately understand the reason of [Gang Ryang-uk’s] visit to New Delhi. He did not bring up any political problems, or of other nature, for whose resolution the Koreans needed the help of the Indian government. During the meetings, the two sides exchanged opinions and information regarding the bilateral collaboration, but nothing precise or related to multilateral cooperation within the Non-Aligned Movement.Moreover, Gang Ryang-uk presented the well-known position of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea regarding the problem of the unification of the country. The Indian Prime-Minister replied that his government shares this position and supports the cause of the Korean people. On a certain occasion, [Morarji] Desai presented the Indian position on the Kashmir issue. In this context he said that “the Korean problems should be solved by Koreans and the Indian problems by Indians”, D.Singh mentioned that Morarji Desai, through his last statement, made reference to the fact that [several] Korean figures, in their conversations with the Pakistanis ex-Prime-Minister, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, on the occasion of his visit to Pyongyang in 1976, would have declared that he supports the position of the Pakistan government on the Kashmir problem. We would like to add that there was no mention in materials published in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, that North Korea supported Pakistan on the Kashmir issue, and that, at the time, such version circulated within the diplomatic corps.SignedVictor Nanu\n",

Such statements are founded on the fact that lately, the United States talk more and more about a policy of ‘rapprochement’ and of ‘peace.’ But such assumptions are groundless and they stem from not knowing exactly the reality in the region, the manner in which the American imperialists act. When analyzing the situation in the Korean Peninsula, one must always take into account the big interests that the United States and Japan have in the region. Against this background, pointed out Kim Yeong-nam, the Tanaka government in Japan, supported by reactionary militarist elements in Japan, promoted an unfriendly, even enemy-like approach towards the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.Prime Minister Takeo Miki, said our interlocutor, brought, to a certain extent, some new elements in Japan’s approach towards the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, showing a more understanding attitude, and evidencing some flexibility. But such positive elements are little sensed, they are unconvincing. The support given by Prime Minister Takeo Miki is not sufficiently solid and therefore he is adopting an unstable, oscillating position. Militarist circles, reactionary elements in Japan continue their hostile propaganda towards the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, stating that in case of the breakout of a war, if American troops are withdrawn from South Korea, Japan is ready to intervene in Korea with its naval and air armed forces. Japan continues to transfer naval forces from Okinawa to American bases in South Korea, with the consent of the Park Chung Hee clique. American-Japanese-South Korean joint military drills are intensifying. At their turn, the South Korean puppets assert that their armed forces are capable of facing off the North Koreans in a military confrontation on their own, which is why they are preparing [so much].The struggle of the popular masses in South Korea for the democratization of society, for the peaceful and independent unification of the homeland is intensifying every day, integrating various social layers and adopting ever more well organized forms, so that they adopt documents like the “Declaration for Democracy and Salvation of the Nation” (March 1st, 1976).Peace-loving peoples in the entire world support the struggle of the Korean people. In Europe and in other parts of the world, solidarity committees are formed, which support the just cause of the Korean people, condemning the anti-popular regime of the South Korean puppets. Numerous youth, women’s, community, religious organizations in Japan, in other countries, criticize the position of those respective countries towards the Democratic People's Republic of Korea through organized efforts—rallies, conferences, etc.—to show their support for the struggle of the Korean people.Signed: Charge d’Affaires V.

      "TELEGRAM 066834To: the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to comrade Constantin Oancea and Ion CiubotaruFrom: the Romanian Embassy in PyongyangSubject: the official visit of the GDR party and state delegation led by Erich Honecker to the DPRKDate: December 15, 1977Classification: SecretFollowing an invitation from the Central Committee of the Workers’ Party of Korea and from the DPRK government, a party and state delegation led by Erich Honecker, General Secretary of the Socialist Unity Party and Chairman of the State Council of the German Democratic Republic, made an official visit of friendship to DPRK during December 8-11. The visit is part of the DPRK’s program of developing and consolidating its relations with socialist countries, and it is also seen as \"contributing to strengthening the cohesion among socialist countries.\"Despite adverse weather conditions, the reception and all other preparations were not substandard, but commensurate with the standard level of preparation for such visits to the DPRK. What was particularly notable was that, during the two receptions, President Kim Il Sung spoke exclusively about bilateral relations, without referring to international problems, whilst Erich Honecker touched upon a wide array of current global issues. Referring to the organization, evolution and content of the visit, during a recent discussion with Victor Nanu, East German Ambassador to the DPRK Franz Everhartz recounted several difficulties in drafting the joint press release.The [North] Koreans, after receiving a first draft of the press release from the East Germans, proposed without further explanations to include in the final version only aspects regarding bilateral relations. Referring to similar previous cases, including the Romanian-[North] Korean joint press release of 1975, the East Germans insisted on also including international issues.    After lengthy discussions and President Kim Il Sung’s personal intervention in the matter, the [North] Koreans agreed to include aspects related to global issues in the final press release. During prolonged and troublesome negotiations over the final draft, it appeared that the DPRK did not agree with the East German phrasing regarding disarmament, contemporary revolutionary forces, socialist principles, and European peace and security. The two parties could not reach a consensus over a mutually acceptable formulation of current international affairs and of the situation in South Africa. Initially, according to the East German Ambassador, the [North] Koreans categorically denied mentioning in the joint statement any aspects related to GDR-FRG relations, West Berlin and the October Socialist Revolution. According to Ambassador Franz Everhartz, during talks between the two delegations, Erich Honecker discussed at length Sino-East German relations. It was noted, among others, that the GDR suggested several times that PRC end its public polemics, without avail. According to West German mass media, the PRC is continuously developing its relations with the FGR. Furthermore, Honecker brought up the PRC’s position against the USSR, noting that \"a potential war declared by the PRC against the USSR is, implicitly, a war against the GDR.\" East German officials explained the GDR’s stance towards the Warsaw Pact, emphasizing its defensive character. Honecker noted that the GDR is ready to develop friendly and collaborative relations with the PRC as long as its Chinese counterpart also manifests interest in this. Within context, referring to the \"misunderstandings and discrepancies\" between certain socialist countries, President Kim Il Sung mentioned that \"such a state of affairs is regrettable as it negatively influences the entire international communist and labor movement.\"The DPRK has close friendly and collaborative relations with all other socialist countries. They have always substantially aided the DPRK, for which the Korean party and state leadership is highly grateful. \"[North] Korea is a historical ally of the USSR and the People’s Republic of China.\" Kim Il Sung noted that his country was freed with the help of the USSR. He further mentioned that geographically (a 1480-kilometer long international border) and historically, Korea is closely connected to the PRC. Following Japan’s surrender in 1945, Korea supplied China with a substantial amount of weaponry; Korean soldiers fought in China. Chairman Mao Zedong noted: \"The Chinese flag also bears the mark of the Korean soldiers.\" In return, Chinese volunteers offered substantial assistance during the Korean War (1950-1953). \"Although we have close ties with the People’s Republic of China,\" claimed President Kim Il Sung. \"We do not agree with many of the Chinese leaders’ positions on both internal and external issues. We have not copied the China model in many respects. Nonetheless, it is necessary to maintain close relations with China. Having good relations with China does not mean we are opportunists,\" mentioned President Kim Il Sung. The DPRK does not agree with the Chinese position against the USSR. The Korean Workers’ Party and the DPRK government are promoting a foreign policy of strengthening the cohesion and collaboration among socialist countries. The DPRK wishes – and is acting accordingly – to maintain good relations with the USSR, the PRC and all other socialist states. \"Given its completely unique situation,\" claimed President Kim Il Sung, \"the DPRK cannot always be open about several political issues. Allegations are that the DPRK is pro-Chinese. Such contentions do not correspond to reality.\"The DPRK maintains good and even very good relations with socialist countries, despite disagreements over certain domestic and international issues. President Kim Il Sung discussed at length the role and importance of the Non-Aligned Movement, the good relations between the DPRK and Third World countries, national emancipation movements, etc. Regarding issues in the region, the Korean delegation discussed the situation in the Korean peninsula, emphasizing the importance of bilateral relations. The GDR proposed enlarging and diversifying North Korean-East German relations. Thus, it was agreed that by the end of this year the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany present a collaboration proposal for the following two years, which is to include provisions regarding information and diplomatic exchanges.On this occasion, an agreement for developing economic, technological and scientific cooperation between the DPRK and the GDR governments was signed. The agreement stipulates, among others, that the DPRK use the credits offered by the GDR several years prior as soon as possible. Reimbursement of the credits at a 2% interest shall be deferred until after 1980. The GDR will supply the DPRK with equipment for the chemical industry, geological explorations, machinery, etc. Furthermore, the GDR will grant the DPRK licenses for synthetic rubber production and the oil industry. On this occasion, a new convention for consular relations was also signed.Furthermore, a long-term trade agreement for 1978-1984 is to be signed by June 1978.Erich Honecker proposed signing a treaty of friendship and collaboration between the two countries. Kim Il Sung accepted the proposal; it was agreed that the treaty will be signed during President Kim Il Sung’s next visit to the GDR. Everhartz concluded that Erich Honecker and the East German delegation are satisfied with the visit, the information exchange, and the open and sincere manner of the discussions. In turn, President Kim Il Sung mentioned during the reception hosted by the GDR that the visit constitutes an important moment in the development of a longstanding friendship and collaboration between the two countries.

Kissinger insisted that the People’s Republic of China agree with the American desire not to withdraw its troops from South Korea and accept the US proposal to convene an international conference—with the participation of the US, the People’s Republic of China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and South Korea—to discuss the Korean matter. Assumptions are being made that the US is not against a U.S.S.R.-backed proposal that the four countries mentioned above should be joined at the international reunion by the U.S.S.R. and Japan. Chinese leaders are entirely against an international reunion on the Korean issue to which the U.S.S.R. would participate. It is mentioned (by the G.D.R. counselor) that the People’s Republic of China publicly backs the proposal of the Korean government, that the Korean issue be discussed by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the US. In talks with Ford however, Vice-Premier Xiaoping is supposed to have appeared favorable towards the four countries’ participation formula.In a talk with V. Nanu on December 13 this year, Polish Ambassador T. Bialkovsk mentioned that Seo Cheol [So Chol], member of the Political Committee of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, during a visit to the Polish Embassy (05.12), was asked if Korean leaders are aware of the particular points discussed in Beijing by President Ford on Korea.The Korean interlocutor responded that “the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has given no mandate for discussions on the topic, that this is a national issue and should be therefore discussed exclusively among Korean leaders; they are entirely against intermediaries.”Moreover, Seo Cheol said that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea leaders unofficially found out that the Korean issue was discussed in Peking, but they are convinced no agreement was reached on the topic.The Korean dignitary said that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is ready to conduct negotiations with the US but no reply had yet arrived from the latter side.We note that the Korean press has not published anything on Ford’s visit to Beijing.Signed: V.

      "TELEGRAM 066.787To: the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs From: the Romanian Embassy in PyongyangDate: July 14th, 1978Regarding your telegram 1/06650:On July 14, during a working visit, Yu Yeong-geol [sic], Section Head within the International Section of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, told the Romanian Chargé d’affaires about the following matters:The party and state leadership of the DPRK decided, initially, to send a youth delegation to the World Youth Festival which will take place in Havana. In this respect, the leadership of the Workers’ Youth Union had taken the necessary measures to prepare and offer the appropriate material conditions and transport of the delegation. During these preparations, [the leadership of the Workers’ Youth Union] realized that [they] were confronted with a series of hurdles and obstacles which could not be overcome, which prompted the decision that the Korean delegation will not participate in the World Youth Festival. With respect to the causes [of this decision] the Korean interlocutor explained that the main problem is that of transporting the delegation. Currently, the DPRK does not have long-haul, across-the-ocean, transportation means. In this respect, 5 years ago, the Koreans asked the USSR to provide them with a IL-62 plane, the Soviets, using different pretexts, did not deliver the plane in question, although [the Koreans] repeated their request and insisted on countless occasions.Recently, on the occasion of a meeting, a representative of the Workers’ Youth Union asked a representative of the Komsomol leadership for support with transporting the Korean delegation to Havana. The Komsomol representative replied that for the matter in question, the president of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers’ Youth Union send a written note to the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Komsomol. The Koreans said that the reply they received was not the one they [were expecting], and that this represents ‘a form of pressure from a big country which tries to prevent the trip to Havana of the Korean delegation.’The second issue which contributed to the Korean decision was the lack of financial resources. The Festival’s international preparatory committee asked for very significant hard currency sums, which are beyond the necessary amounts for past such events.The Koreans, despite the efforts they undertook, did not manage to overcome these difficulties – the lack of transportation means and of financial resources.The Korean Preparatory Committee for the Festival informed the International Committee that the DPRK would not send a youth delegation to the Havana festival.SignedVictor Nanu\f\n",

Yssassi, said that the conversations and meetings with president Kim Il Sung, [as well as] the bilateral documents released set a solid foundation for a close collaboration between the two countries, especially on economic matters.On the occasion of the aforementioned visit, it was agreed that the DPRK exports agricultural equipment to the Central African Empire, and imports coffee, high-quality timber and diamonds from the Central African Empire. Moreover, the Koreans, at the Central African’s request, agreed to build a palace for Emperor Bokassa, in the style of Geumsusan Palace in Pyongyang. The Central Africans would provide the construction materials, the equipment etc. With a view to studying working conditions, and finishing the future palace’s project, a group of Korean specialists has been in Bangui since May 1978.A Korean economic delegation, led by Kim Gyeong-yeon, the DPRK Minister of Finance, left for Bangui on July 9th, in order to settle the  issue of the concrete forms of collaboration, the means and conditions for transporting the goods [traded between the two countries], as well as the issue of payments [for exports].

      "TELEGRAM 066764To: the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to comrade Ion CiubotaruFrom: the Romanian Embassy in PyongyangSubject: Pol Pot’s visit to the DPRKDate: October 10, 1977Classification: SecretFollowing an invitation from Comrade Kim Il Sung, General Secretary of the Workers’ Party of Korea, President of the DPRK, Pol Pot, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Kampuchea, Prime Minister of Democratic Kampuchea, made an official visit of friendship to North Korea during 4-8 October. Part of the DPRK’s current efforts for establishing, maintaining, and diversifying friendly and collaborative relations with Asian countries, the Kampuchean visit was met with special, unprecedented attention.Back in public opinion after an absence of approximately two years, Democratic Kampuchea has received wide coverage in the [North] Korean media, particularly in regards to the Kampuchean Communist Party’s 17th anniversary and the aforementioned visit. The unprecedented level of preparations for the visit, as well as the numerous expressions of friendship, solidarity, and identity of opinion and interest indicate the DPRK’s desire to develop bilateral relations with Kampuchea on multiple levels and to award these relations a very special attention. As such, Kim Il Sung emphasized in a speech that ‘the Korean people will tirelessly strive to achieve exemplary relations between the two countries.’ On the other hand, Pol Pot underlined the close ties of brotherly and revolutionary friendship, as well as the militant solidarity between the two countries, based on the principles of ‘Marxism-Leninism and genuine Proletarian Internationalism.’ Kim Il Sung’s speeches delivered during Comrade Pol Pot’s visit to the DPRK reveal ‘the great joy of the Korean people to have such a strong ally within Asia.’ The speeches, as well as the joint press release, emphasize the identity of opinion between the two countries regarding Korean reunification and the socialist revolution in Kampuchea. ‘Protecting the territorial integrity of the country’ was particularly underlined. Among others, President Kim Il Sung emphasized that safeguarding the revolutionary gains of Democratic Kampuchea is ‘a holy international duty.’ In his speech, Pol Pot stated: ‘we will never attack or instigate aggression against any neighboring or distant country. We will never intervene in the internal affairs of other countries or conduct espionage operations in any neighboring or distant country. But we will not allow anyone to intervene in our domestic affairs and to conduct subversive or espionage operations against our country.’ We gather that the repeated references to Kampuchea’s territorial integrity in Pol Pot’s speeches are directed to the country’s current relation with the neighboring Socialist Republic of Vietnam. Referring to the current international scene, both Kim Il Sung and Pol Pot emphasize the enhanced role of the Non-Aligned Movement and Third World countries and the importance of respecting the principles of independence and sovereignty, territorial integrity, the right to decide over one’s own fate and non-interference in internal affairs. Both parties express solidarity with developing countries’ struggle to implement a new international economic order. In his speeches, Kim Il Sung mentioned the importance of the role the Kampuchean people’s revolutionary struggle played in accelerating the anti-imperialist emancipation struggles of oppressed peoples in Asia and around the world. Within context, the DPRK’s and Democratic Kampuchea’s contribution to the development of the international communist movement were mentioned. On the occasion of the Kampuchean delegation’s visit to the DPRK, there have been numerous references to the Asian continent. Thus, President Kim Il Sung noted: ‘the revolutionary process of transition from colonialism to a new, independent, and flourishing Asia was not easy. A fierce struggle between the peoples of these countries and the imperial and colonial forces is under way, like it was in the past. We will continue this resolute struggle in close cooperation with the Asian countries fighting against imperialism and colonialism, and we will build a new Asia, free from exploitation, suppression and inequality.’ Members of the diplomatic corps in Pyongyang noted the particular attention offered by the DPRK to the Kampuchean delegation’s high-level visit. In a discussion with V. Nanu, Liu Kung Bai [sic], Adviser for the Chinese Embassy, noted that Pol Pot enjoyed special attention even in Beijing. Pol Pot’s visits to Pyongyang and Beijing, noted the Chinese Adviser, ‘represent the beginning of a new stage in the development of bilateral relations between Democratic Kampuchea and other countries, and such visits will take place in many other partner countries.’ Signed: V.

      "TELEGRAM  084120To: the Romanian Ministry of Foreign AffairsFrom: the Romanian Embassy in Washington, DCSubject: US – South KoreaDate: February 7, 1977Classification: SecretEdward Hurwitz, Director of the Korea Desk in the US State Department, told Comrade Petre Anghel, Third Secretary, the following: The Carter administration has decided to implement measures announced during the 1976 political campaign, particularly those regarding improving bilateral relations and US troop withdrawal from South Korea. According to the bilateral security treaty, the US will maintain its commitment to strengthen the security of this country and gradually withdraw ground troops in consultation with both South Korean and Japanese authorities. This position has been recently restated by Vice President Walter Mondale in discussions with the Japanese Prime Minister. The situation in the Korean Peninsula remains tense and explosive, and the US does not want to alter the military and strategic balance in the region through its position. The decision to partly withdraw American troops from South Korea is mostly the result of internal pressure within the US, especially after Vietnam, to maintain limited military presence so as to avoid a potential implication in a new military conflict. The DPRK’s recent four-point statement regarding contacts between various political and military organizations in North and South Korea is not concurrent with the joint North-South four-point statement and, thus, not viable. Furthermore, reopening discussions on the Korean question at the United Nations in the current context is not likely to decrease tensions within the Peninsula. The US believes that a first step could be made through a joint Sino-Soviet-American effort and is willing to have contacts with the DPRK as long as the USSR and the PRC initiate contact with South Korea.

      "TELEGRAM  084354To: the Romanian Ministry of Foreign AffairsFrom: the Romanian Embassy in Washington, DCSubject: the Korean questionDate: March 21, 1977Classification: SecretDuring 8-10 March, the South Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs visited Washington to consult with the US on the matter and met with President Carter at the latter’s request.During the meeting with the South Korean Minister, President Carter reaffirmed: - the United States’ commitment to maintain and preserve security in South Korea;- the United States’ decision to gradually withdraw American ground troops from South Korea in consultation with South Korea and Japan, without damaging South Korea’s security or altering the strategic and military balance in the Korean Peninsula;- the US administration’s firm position regarding human rights issues and the need for Seoul to take appropriate measures so as not to compromise the development of bilateral relations in the future. Edward Hurwitz, Director of the Korea Desk in the US Department of State, told Comrade Petre Anghel, Third Secretary, that the South Korean Minister’s discussions with President Carter and State Department representatives have managed to reduce South Korea’s concerns regarding allegations of a diminished US interest in their bilateral relations and in the region. US officials reassured the South Korean Minister that they will not proceed to an immediate withdrawal of American troops and that the process will be gradual, with the direct cooperation and participation of South Korean authorities. Concurrently, American representatives reiterated the position that the US will not accept discussing solutions to the Korean issue in the absence of envoys from Seoul. According to the US diplomat, the DPRK sent a message to the new administration via the Pakistani government, proposing to initiate a dialogue with the US in order to sign a definitive peace treaty and establish stable bilateral relations.    The US responded that it cannot accept a dialogue with the DPRK, which excludes South Korea, and proposed a four-party meeting to discuss a new settlement initiating a constructive bilateral dialogue between the two Koreas. According to Hurwitz, although it is difficult to estimate if and to what extent the DPRK will abandon the rigid position upheld hitherto, a less aggressive tone has been noticeable in its recent statements regarding the United States. In regards to discussing the Korean issue at the UN, the US would prefer a situation similar to the one from the last General Assembly. Thus far, American representatives have no knowledge of the issue’s inclusion on the agenda for the next Assembly. However, if this were to happen, it would only lead to sterile discussions and a potential intensification of the tensions in the Korean Peninsula.  Signed: Nicolae M. Nicolae \n",

      "TELEGRAM 084.650To: the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Fifth Directorate)From: the Romanian Embassy in Washington, D.C. Date: May 17th, 1978 Classification: SecretSubject: KoreaDavid Blakemore, Deputy Head of the Korean Desk in the State Department, told Comrade Petre Anghel, Third Secretary in the Romanian Embassy in Washington, D.C., the following:There have been no new special elements in Korean-American relations recently. The current problems that concern both sides, especially the Carter administration, and which can affect in a great measure bilateral relations, depending on the manner in which they are resolved, are the retreat of the American forces, the Congressional investigations into the illegal activities of South Korea in the United States, and the situation of the human rights in Korea. President Carter announced that the withdrawal of American troops would be delayed for 1978, which is considered a concession of the administration to various political circles, especially the Congressional ones, which are against the withdrawal of the American ground troops from Korea, arguing that this withdrawal would result in unfavorable consequences for the security of South Korea as well as for the political situation in that area.Moreover, the US House Committee on Armed Services signed an amendment to the law regarding the budget of the Department of Defense, which stipulates that the withdrawal will not take place unless the conditions of financial compensation and maintaining at least 26,000 soldiers in Korea, from the approximately 33,000 soldiers planned to be withdrawn, will be met. The financial compensation proposed by the Carter administration (which amounts to approximately $800 million) was approved by the respective committees but it must be approved in the joint sessions of both Senate and the House of Representatives. While difficulties in the House of Senate aren’t foreseen, the situation in the House of Representatives is more difficult. These difficulties are the result of the fact that a large number of House representatives are conditioning the signing of the financial compensation amendment on the respect for human rights in South Korea and on the cooperation South Korea will show in the investigations of illicit activities of some South Korean representatives.The situation in the Korean peninsula is still tense and potentially dangerous. At the current moment no action can be taken to improve this situation.  For the time being, no action which could mitigate this state of affairs is foreseen. Recently, the North Koreans made some declarations regarding a three-party meeting, [denouncing it] as a new plot of the United States of America. Actually, the proposal was made by President Tito and it entails a meeting between the representatives of North Korea, South Korea, and the US. In these circumstances, the American diplomat noted the efforts of USSR and People’s Republic of China, which influenced the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to adopt a more reserved attitude. Moreover, even though they were expecting a more virulent position against the United States of America and South Korea from the president of the Chinese Communist Party during his visit to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, the Chinese did not express such a position. Another clue of the moderating role of China is the absence of some military personalities in the delegation of the Chinese President Hua Guofeng.Signed Nicolae M. Nicolae\n",

According to several Department of State representatives, the attitude of North Korean officials is due to Jimmy Carter’s position on the matter during his electoral campaign, – i.e. reducing US troops stationed in South Korea – as well as to the potential support from the USSR, the PRC and several Non-Aligned countries. Thus, the DPRK addressed an open letter to President-elect Jimmy Carter and, following his inauguration, sent messages through various heads of state from Africa and Asia, including the President of Gabon and former Pakistani Prime Minister Z. A. Bhutto. During his recent visit to the US, Edvard Kardelj also transmitted a message to the American government on behalf of North Korea, through which the DPRK expressed its interest to initiate a dialogue with the US administration regarding the Korean issue. R. Petkovic, Minister at the Yugoslav Embassy, told Comrade Gh. Ionita (Advisor) that North Korean leaders asked President Tito, during his visit to the DPRK this summer, to ensure President Carter receives the message as soon as possible. According to the Yugoslav diplomat, President Jimmy Carter read the message intently, telling Edvard Kardelj that his administration is interested in initiating talks with the North Koreans, however South Korean envoys must also participate with equal rights. Jimmy Carter emphasized to Kardelj what he also responded to the other North Korean messages, namely that:a) the Carter administration considers that discussing the Korean issue at the UN is not likely to be conducive to the proper conditions for finding an adequate solution to the situation in the region;b) the Carter administration is willing to do everything to decrease tensions on the Korean Peninsula and minimize the possibility of a military conflict in the region;c) the US does not oppose a direct dialogue with North Korean envoys, however South Korean representatives must also participate since the US cannot accept excluding South Korea due to its binding obligations under bilateral treaties, as well as to the potential negative reactions South Korea’s exclusion would trigger in Asia, particularly in Japan.

OCTOBER 1976ttr/mlh118 SMUGGLING AT NORTH KOREA’S EMBASSIESDISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION RELATING TO SMUGGLING AT NORTH KOREA’S EMBASSIES IN THE NORDIC COUNTRIESIn the German press, only minor note has been taken of the issue, and these have mainly been brief accounts of the events.As the first German newspaper thus far, Die Welt has today, 21/10, printed a longer article with background information on the North Korean organization and their operation in northern and western Europe. The article can be found on the front page.The newspaper claims the smuggling operation was organized from North Korea’s embassy in Karlshort in East Berlin. Chief of the operation was Colonel Kim Hak Tschel [sic], who until recently functioned as military attaché at the embassy. The newspaper claims to have proof that beyond smuggling, the organization was involved in extensive arms trade and espionage. Customs authorities and security services in West Berlin have over a longer period observed the traffic around the Embassy. According to the article, between four and eight vehicles crossed the border to West Berlin in Friedrichstrasse daily.Die Welt claims that Colonel Kim is known to authorities in the Federal Republic. Security services hold extensive dossiers on his activities. The North Korean organization had chapters in West Berlin, Bonn, Brussels, Oslo, Stockholm, Copenhagen, and Vienna.According to the newspaper, the military intelligence service in the Bundesrepublik holds information indicating Colonel Kim’s espionage on matters such as weapons systems and electronic equipment of the Starfighter and Phantom jets of the German Air Force. In Stuttgart, an attempt to distribute a new army pistol has been revealed. The operation also involves espionage relating to the ‘Leopard’ tank, as well as various types of light weaponry.A North Korean agent who was recently released from a West Berlin prison after serving a sentence of many years, has disclosed that he was paid in British pounds by Military Attaché Kim.North Korean agents established relations with people at industry fairs in Hanover, Hamburg, Düsseldorf, and West Berlin, with the intention of receiving deliveries of products that are prohibited from export to East Bloc countries.Throughout the operation, the North Koreans have also acted as middlemen for KGB, GRU (the Soviet military intelligence service), and the East German intelligence service. Die Welt even states the reference number (1 p ar/57.73) of the documents in the archives of the West German intelligence service that relates to the latter.The Embassy assumes that the article in Die Welt can be obtained by the Foreign Ministry at Oslo.Noramb [Norwegian Ambassador]11004a noreg n885491 noram d\n",

I replied that this was of course objectionable, and expressed my hope that no Norwegian diplomats were involved. To this he replied that if that was the case, he would have notified me.I went on to elaborate on the North Korean activities in Norway and how this stands in bleak contrast to the high moral principles to which the North Koreans claim to adhere. I added, in a playful tone, that rumors had it that eight North Korean diplomats had been expelled from the Soviet Union.To this he replied that North Korea was a special case strongly influenced by Kim Il Sung’s Napoleon complex. The rumors regarding the expulsion of North Korean diplomats were untrue. It was however true that some North Koreans had left Moscow as a result of their involvement in drug smuggling. However, not only North Koreans had been involved in this smuggling. Substance abuse was becoming a problem in Moscow and other major cities, even if the problem was not yet as widespread as in the US and Western Europe. It was on this background Soviet authorities saw it necessary to react with strong punishments for a number of foreign nationals who were involved in drug smuggling.To my remark that I believed all the foreigners had been in transit, he replied that for many of them, this was not the case. He also said there were also diplomats among the foreigners.- - -It seems natural to interpret these statements to mean that North Korean diplomats have been forced to leave Moscow after involvement in drug smuggling. However, this does not necessarily mean that the Nordic embassies have received their narcotics from Moscow. It should however not be seen as entirely unlikely that this is the case.[Petter] Graver\n",

      "According to the information received from the competent department of the Soviet Foreign Ministry, several signs indicate that Sino-Korean relations keep worsening. Among these signs, we mention first of all that recently new pamphlets were published in Beijing, which contained a sharp attack on the Korean Workers’ Party and the person of Kim Il Sung, threatening the leader of the Korean Workers’ Party with that the Korean people would take vengeance upon him for his revisionist policy. The estrangement of relations was also indicated by, for instance, the circumstances under which the latest Chinese holiday was celebrated in the DPRK. At the reception of the Chinese embassy, the level of representation on the Koreans’ part was very low, the telegram of congratulations the Korean leaders sent to the Chinese was very cold, and no festive mass meetings took place in the country on the occasion of the Chinese national holiday. According to the information available for our [Soviet] comrades, the Chinese chargé d’affaires to Pyeongyang complains of that his opportunities to maintain contacts are very limited.In the course of their contacts with the Soviet comrades, the Koreans, on their part, lay a rather great stress on the worsening of Sino-Korean relations, and they particularly emphasize that these relations have worsened in the economic field as well, for China does not supply those traditional export articles which are of primary importance for the Korean national economy, or it supplies [only] a relatively small amount of them. For example, coking coal, without which the furnaces of the DPRK would cease work, is such an article.Nevertheless, it is the impression of our comrades that although the Chinese side indeed tends to reduce its economic contacts with Korea, the Korean side exaggerates the extent of that [pressure] while negotiating with the Soviet comrades. The obvious reason of this is that they strive to bring the Soviet Union to increase [Soviet-North Korean] economic contacts to such an extent that would also include certain opportunities of over-insurance for the DPRK. This manifested itself quite clearly during the talks a Korean economic delegation headed by Deputy Premier and Minister of Foreign Trade Yi Ri Ju-yeon [Ri Ju Yon], a member of the Korean Workers’ Party P[olitical] C[ommittee], had in the Soviet Union.[…]In the course of the Moscow negotiations, which lasted approximately for a month, […] the Korean side proposed a substantial extension of the list of articles exchanged between the two countries, namely, by increasing Soviet exports through the increased supply of machinery and equipment, auto and tractor tires, rolled non-ferrous metals, and other \"hard\" goods, whereas it intended to increase [North Korean] exports to the Soviet Union by [supplying] goods whose exports had already been halted and of which the Soviet Union had, and has, little need. Despite that, the Soviets, on their part, showed willingness to accept, on the whole, the Korean proposal, with regard to both exports and imports, and consequently in 1968 the exchange of goods between the two countries will increase, in all likelihood, by some 49 per cent in comparison with the previous year, and it will practically rise to the level planned for 1970. […]Thus the economic contacts between the two countries are improving, albeit the developments are not necessarily beneficial for the Soviet Union in every respect. \"Unfortunately,\" [the officials of] the MID [the Soviet Foreign Ministry] point out, \"this statement cannot be applied to other fields of the relationship between the two countries.\" Here they concretely mention, on the one hand, those disagreements which exist between the two countries and the two parties with regard to the evaluation of the situation of the Communist and world movement and of the international situation in general, and, on the other hand, that therefore one can hardly speak of the intensification of political cooperation between the two countries. In the Soviet Foreign Ministry [the officials] emphasize that despite the support the Soviet Union and the other socialist countries gave, and give, to the DPRK in the UN with regard to the Korean question, in many respects the DPRK quite rigidly refuses to express its support for the international policy of the Soviet Union.In the course of the conversation our official [András Köves] had in the MID, […] the Soviet side made the – obviously by no means official – statement that the Koreans and a few other parties – the Cubans, the Japanese CP, and this group also regarded the Vietnamese Workers’ Party as one of them – increasingly considered themselves the vanguard parties of the international Communist movement, which, on the one hand, undertook to play the greatest role in the struggle against imperialism, and, on the other hand, it was solely [these parties] which, on this basis, fought a consistent struggle in the Communist movement against leftist and rightist revisionism, and in the future they might also intend to provide this political standpoint with some formal base.It is well-known that the position the CPSU – like the majority of the Communist parties of the world – has on a number of questions of the international situation and the world Communist movement is quite fundamentally different from [the position] of these parties. For instance, in the view of the Korean comrades the task is to increase international tension and, on this basis, intensify the struggle against American imperialism, while in the opinion of the CPSU it is international détente that guarantees better circumstances for the anti-imperialist struggle of the peoples. Perhaps this is the fundamental antagonism [between the USSR and the DPRK], and it is of relatively secondary importance how one evaluates the role Korea or, for instance, Cuba undertakes to play in the anti-imperialist struggle of the socialist camp and the Communist movement in general. Namely, one can hardly accept the statement that Korea and Cuba are the advanced posts of the [anti-]imperialist struggle in the east and in the west respectively, and it is they which are subjected to the greatest pressure in the struggle against imperialism. On the contrary, the truth is most probably that it is exactly in Europe where the front between the two systems is the sharpest. […]As is well-known, the Korean party and government delegation headed by Comrade Choe Yong-geon [Choe Yong Gon] that had participated in the celebrations of 7th November left [the USSR] for Cuba for a few days. Thus it returned President Dorticos’ official visit to Korea. Having returned from Cuba, the Korean side very emphatically told the Soviet comrades that this visit had been of an exclusively protocollary character, but this way they actually reinforced the impression of our comrades that negotiations aimed at the intensification of bilateral Cuban-Korean cooperation had taken place in Havana. It is well-known that precisely because of the political essence of that cooperation, our comrades are not enthusiastic about the latter, particularly when it is accompanied by certain gestures which are not exactly friendly toward the Soviet comrades, for example, when Comrade Kim Il Sung does not write the article for Pravda for which the central paper of the CPSU asked him (and the leaders of a number of other Communist parties) on the occasion of 7th November but publishes an article in a journal of the Cuban party instead, and this article once again highlights those issues in which the Korean Workers’ Party adopts a special standpoint that is opposed to [the position of] the majority of the parties of the international Communist movement.As is well-known, Comrade Brezhnev received Comrade Choe Yong-geon during his stay here [in the USSR]. Comrade Brezhnev raised two groups of issues at this meeting. On the one hand, the problem of the international Communist meeting; on the other hand, the issue of the tension between North and South Korea along the demilitarized zone. […]Basically the Soviet Union does not accept the standpoint of the DPRK with regard to the cause of the tension along the demilitarized zone. It thinks – and it also gives expression to that vis-a-vis the Korean comrades – that the United States does not intend to increase tension in this region, and nothing points to that [the U.S.] really aims at starting a new Korean War. It is obvious that the various factors of the international situation of the USA, such as the Vietnam War, do not make the perspective of a new Asian war attractive for the United States.On the basis of the evidence available for it – among others, the statements made by the Czechoslovak and Polish members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission –, the Soviet Union has concluded that it is the DPRK that initiates the majority of the incidents occurring along the demilitarized zone.The Soviets, on their part, expound to our Korean comrades that they understand the necessity of the DPRK’s struggle for the unification of the country. They support this struggle, but they are of the opinion that one should pay due regard to the concrete Korean and international conditions of the actual period when choosing the means and methods of the struggle. Therefore the Soviet side doubts that armed struggle is an appropriate method for the restoration of the unity of Korea.For instance, in a military sense it would be, in all probability, inappropriate to come to such conclusions that the numerical superiority the DPRK’s army has over the South Korean and American armies stationed in South Korea, and the essential militarization of the country, would render it possible for the DPRK to carry out successful military actions. Besides, the Soviet Union also tries to caution the DPRK against possible ill-considered actions by that the military assistance it gives to that country is confined to the supply of defensive arms. But the Korean comrades may make the mistake of not taking the nature and characteristics of modern warfare into consideration to a sufficient extent.Despite the aforesaid issues, it is the impression of our comrades that at present the DPRK, on its part, does not strive for a wider military action but by the permanent provoking of border incidents and the accompanying propaganda campaign it intends to justify the militarization of the country and the fact that they [the KWP leaders], their official standpoint notwithstanding, do not develop the defense strength and the economy of the country simultaneously but lay stress only on the increasing of military strength, [which results in] the neglect of economic development and the stagnation of living standards.In addition to the aforementioned issues, with regard to the internal situation of the DPRK they [the Soviets] remark that lately the personality cult of Kim Il Sung has further increased to a great extent. Recently a number of functionaries have been removed from the posts they occupied, and they have disappeared from public life. During the first wave of the purges it seemed that it affected primarily those leaders who had adopted a more or less pro-Chinese standpoint and who may have opposed the shaping of the Korean Workers’ Party’s independent policy that rejected the political line of the Chinese party leadership. Later, however, there occurred a second wave of the purges, whose political content has not become clear yet for our comrades. In their view, the party functionaries got involved in this wave hardly seem to be the representatives of some Chinese line within the Korean party. Therefore they [the Soviets] feel uneasy about the further developments of the internal political situation.[…]                                                                                                                     József Oláh                                                                                                                                                       (chargé d’affaires)\n",

      "소련 외무부의 믿을만한 부서가 제공한 정보에 따르면, 중-조 관계가 악화되고 있는 몇 가지 징후가 보인다고 한다. 이런 징후 중 하나는 최근 베이징에서 만들어진 선전물이 조선로동당 당수가 그의 수정주의 정책으로 인해 조선인민의 보복을 당하게 될 것이라고 위협하는 등 조선로동당과 김일성을 날카롭게 비판하는 내용을 담고 있다는 것이다. 반목의 징후는 최근 조선민주주의인민공화국이 중국 기념일을 대하는 태도에서도 볼 수 있다. 중국대사관의 환영회에 참석한 조선대표단의 직급이 매우 낮았고, 중국에 보낸 조선 대표들의 축하전신 역시 냉담했으며, 중국 국가기념일에도 조선 내에 기념집회가 없었다. 우리 소련동지가 제공한 정보에 따르면, 평양의 중국대리공사는 접촉기회가 매우 제한되어 있다는 것에 불만을 토로한다고 한다.소련 동지는 조선인들도 악화된 중-조 관계로 인해 어려움을 겪고 있는데, 특히 중국이 조선경제에 있어서 중요한 기존의 수출품들을 수출하지 않거나 적은 양만을 공급함으로써 경제분야에서도 양국의 관계가 악화되었다고 했다. 이런 물자는 점결탄[coking coal]과 같이 없으면 조선민주주의인민공화국이 일을 중단해야 하는 품목들을 말한다.우리 정보통은 중국측이 경제적 교류를 실제로 줄이려 하기는 하나, 조선측이 소련과 협상을 할 때는 이를 과장하는 것 같다는 인상을 받는다고 한다. 조선민주주의인민공화국은 넉넉한 보험으로써 소련과의 경제교역을 늘리고 싶어하기 때문이다. 이는 리주연 부수상(무역부 장관, 조선로동당 정치국 당원)이 이끄는 경제대표단의 소련 방문 시 있었던 담화에서도 그가 분명히 밝힌바 있다.[…]약 한달 가량 지속된 모스크바 협상에서, 북측은 소련이 기계, 장비, 자동차, 트랙터 타이어 등의 비철금속과 기타 내구소비재의 수출을 확대하고, 소련이 이미 보유하고 있거나, 필요하지 않아 수입을 중지한 품목을 조선으로부터 대량 수입하는 방식으로 두 나라의 교역품목을 크게 확대하기를 제안했다. 그럼에도 불구하고 소련은 이와 같은 조선의 제안을 기꺼이 받아들임에 따라, 두 나라의 무역 수준은 1968년에 전년도 대비 49%의 무역 확대가 있을 것이며, 실질적으로는 1970년도 무역 목표치를 달성할 것이다.[…]비록 모든 면에서 소련에게 유익한 성과는 아니지만, 두 나라의 경제교류는 증가하고 있다. 불행히도 소련 외무성 MID의 관계자들은 이런 발언이 양국간의 다른 분야에서도 있어서는 안될 것 이라고 지적했다. 그들은 이는 한편으로는 국제공산주의 운동과 일반적인 국제상황을 해석하는데 두 국가, 두 당의 의견이 불일치 한다는 것이고, 다른 한편으로는 그렇기에 두 국가의 정치적 협력 강화가 어렵다고 볼 수 있다는 점을 분명히 말했다. 소련 외무성 관료는 지금까지 유엔에서 소련과 다른 사회주의 국가들이 조선민주주의인민공화국을 지지했음에도 불구하고, 조선민주주의인민공화국은 여러 면에서 소련의 국제정책 지지를 거부하고 있음을 지적했다.MID의 우리 관계자[András Köves]는 대화 중, 소련측이 비공식적으로 조선과 몇몇 집단-쿠바와 일본공산당, 베트남노동당-이 점점 그들 스스로를 국제공산당운동의 선봉이라 생각한다는 말을 했다. 이는 한편으로는 이들이 제국주의에 투쟁하는 막중한 역할을 하는 것이고, 또 한편으로는 근본적으로 좌파와 우파의 수정주의에 대항하는 지속적인 공산주의 투쟁을 수행하는 것이며, 향후 이들은 이러한 정치적인 입지기반을 내놓으려 할 것이다.국제 공산당의 다수당으로서의 소련공산당의 입장은 국제상황과 국제공산주의운동의 문제에 있어서 근본적으로 이들과 다른 입장이라는 점은 잘 알려져 있다. 예를 들어 조선동지들의 관점으로는 근본적으로 미 제국주의에 대한 투쟁을 강화하고 국제적인 긴장을 고조시키는 것을 과업이라고 생각한다면, 소련공산당은 반제국주의 투쟁을 위한 더 좋은 환경을 보장하는 것이 국제적 긴장완화라는 의견이다. 이는 소련과 조선민주주의인민공화국 사이의 근본적인 반목이며, 사실 조선이나 쿠바가 사회주의 진영에서의 반제국주의 투쟁이나 일반적인 공산주의 운동에서 어떤 역할을 수행하는지를 평가하는 것은 상대적으로 부차적인 문제인 것이다. 즉, 조선과 쿠바가 각각 동양과 서양에서 반 제국주의 투쟁의 선봉을 맡고 있다는 것은 인정하기 어려운 사실이며, 오히려 이들은 반제국주의 투쟁에 있어 압력으로 작용하는 존재인 것이다. 오히려, 투쟁이 가장 첨예한 지역은 유럽이다.알려진 바와 같이, 최용건 동지가 이끄는 조선로동당과 정부의 대표단이 7차 11월 경축행사에 참석한 후 소련을 떠나 쿠바로 갔다. 이는 도르티코스[Dorticos] 대통령의 공식 조선방문으로 이어졌다. 쿠바에서 돌아온 후 조선측은 우리 동지들에게 이번 방문은 매우 배타적이고 형식적인 성격이라고 했지만, 이런 방식으로 조선측은 소련 동지들에게 조선과 쿠바의 양자 협력을 위한 협상이 하바나에서 있었다는 것을 사실상 강조한 것이다. 특히 그 협력의 정치적 의미 때문에 우리 동지들은 이를 하지 않는데다, 북조선은 우호적이지 않은 행태를 보이는 상황이다. 일례로 김일성 동지는 7번째 11월 경축행사를 주제로 하는 소련공산당 중앙위원회 기관지인 프라우다의 기고청탁은 거절한 반면, 쿠파 당지에 기고를 했는데, 이 사설에서 조선로동당은 국제공산주의운동의 다수당과 반대입장을 취한다는 점을 강조했다. 아는바와 같이 브레즈네프 동지는 최용건 동지의 소련 체류 중 이곳에서 그를 만났다. 브레즈네프는 이 만남에서 두 가지 안건을 내놓았다. 하나는 국제공산주의 회담의 문제이고, 다른 하나는 비무장지대에 대한 남측과 북측의 갈등 문제였다.근본적으로 소련은 비무장지대를 둘러싼 갈등에 대해 조선민주주의인민공화국의 입장을 받아들이지 않는다. 미국은 이 지역의 긴장고조는 물론 또 한번의 한국전쟁을 원치 않는 것으로 보인다. 베트남전 등 국제상황의 여러 요인들로 인해 미국이 아시아 지역의 새로운 전쟁을 원치 않는다는 것은 명백하다.중립국감독위원회 국가인 체코슬로바키아와 폴란드의 위원회 관계자가 제공한 증거를 기초로, 소련은 비무장지대에서의 대부분의 사건들이 조선민주주의인민공화국에 의해 일어난다고 결론지었다.소련동지들은 조선동지들에게 조국통일을 위한 조선민주주의인민공화국의 투쟁의 필요성을 충분히 이해한다고 설명했다. 그들은 이러한 투쟁을 지지하지만, 투쟁수단과 방법을 선택하는 시점에서, 조선 및 국제 상황을 충분히 고려해야 한다는 의견이다. 따라서 소련측은 무장투쟁이 조선 통일의 적절한 방법인지에 대해 회의적이다.예를 들어 조선민주주의인민공화국이 군사적 측면만 고려하여, 자신의 군대가 남조선과 남조선에 주둔한 미군을 합한 것보다 다방면에서 우위에 있으니 군비확장으로 군사적 행동을 성공시키는 것이 가능하다고 결론 낸다면 이는 부적절한 것이다. 게다가 소련은 방위적 지원에 한정된 소련의 군사지원에 의지하여 조선민주주의인민공화국이 섣부른 군사적 행동을 취하지 않도록 항상 경고하고 있다. 하지만 조선동지들은 현대전의 성격과 특성을 충분히 고려하지 않는 우를 범하게 될 것만 같다.전술한 문제들에도 불구하고, 우리 동지들은 현재 조선민주주의인민공화국이 광범위한 군사행동을 열망한다기보다는 흑색선전을 동반한 국경지역의 도발을 반복하여 군비확장을 정당화함은 물론, 조선로동당 지도부의 공식적 입장과는 달리 방위력과 경제를 동시에 발전시키지 않고 군사력 강화에만 힘쓰는 사실을 정당화한다는 인상을 받았다고 한다. 이는 결국 경제개발을 무시하여 생활수준의 침체를 초래할 것이다.덧붙여 조선민주주의인민공화국의 내부상황을 본다면, 김일성에 대한 숭배가 더욱 강화되고 있다는 말을 했다. 최근 다수의 당원들이 지위를 박탈당하고 공식석상에서 사라졌는데, 일차숙청에서는 중국 지도부와 단절된 조선로동당의 독자적 정책노선을 반대하는 친중국 주요 지도자들이 대상인 것으로 보인다. 하지만 이후 이차숙청 대상의 정치적 성향은 소련 동지도 파악하지 못하고 있다. 이차숙청 대상자들이 대표적인 친중국 인사들로 보이지 않는다고 했다. 소련동지들은 조선의 내부 정치상황에 대해 그 이상 알기 힘든 것으로 보인다.[…]József Oláh (대리공사)                         \n",

North Korean officials consider that soon the phase of stagnation in North-South dialogue will be overcome.In the meantime, at the suggestion of North Korea, the Chinese-U.S. dialogue has begun in view of the gradual withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea as well as the request of South Korea for U.S. guarantees that the withdrawal of troops be realized only with the condition of modernizing the South Korean army.Conversely, both sides have engaged in a diplomatic and political offensive in order to obtain international support for their own plan to isolate the other side.Signed: L.

It was the third high-level visit (a DPRK Vice-President visited Pakistan in 1974 and the Chief of the General Staff visited Pakistan in July 1977), two years after the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries. During the visit, the head of the Korean delegation was received by President Fazal Ilahi Chaudhry and held talks with the head of the government, General Zia-Ul-Haq. The [main] issues on the agenda [included]: expanding commercial relations, strengthening the friendship and cooperation between the two countries. Per the cooperation between the two countries, the possibility of buying weapons and spare parts was explored.In addition, Pakistan could benefit from Korea’s experience in the field of agriculture and in mining. Pakistan imports the following products: cement, chemical products, steel reinforcements, machine tools; it exports: raw cotton, textiles, fabrics, soaps and leather. The volume of trade between the two countries is the same as between 1973-1974 ($4 million).  Vice-President Pak Seong-cheol gave General Zia a message about the Korean question from President Kim Il Sung, as well as an invitation to visit the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (a visit which will probably take place in May 1978). The head of the North Korean delegation said that Pakistan’s policies, aimed at consolidating its national independence against imperialism, colonialism and racism, at defending [its] national sovereignty.As far as the Korean question is concerned, the Korean official said that the danger of a war is constantly [looming over] Korea, and that his people is determined to obtain the reunification of the two parts of the country by peaceful means. While thanking Pakistan for the support it gave [North Korea] with the reunification of Korea, Pak Seong-cheol expressed his conviction that the friendly relations and cooperation between the two countries would continue to grow. He asked Pakistan not to establish diplomatic relations with South Korea, and thus, not give way to the American policy aimed at entrenching the division [of the country].General Zia-Ul-Haq reaffirmed his country’s support for the peaceful reunification of the Korean people, according to the UN Charter and Resolution; he said that the resolution of the Korean question is necessary for Asia’s durable peace and stability; he promised that [Pakistan’s] relations with South Korea would be maintained at consular-level.Towards the end of the visit, the Pakistanis said that the two countries shared the same views on the matters Asia is confronted with in particular, and the Third World, in general; [both] Pakistan and the DPRK share an interest in establishing a new international economic and political order, aimed at global peace. The visit of the [North] Korean delegation to Pakistan, a country which has relations with the Seoul regime at general consulate level, is [part and parcel] of the policy adopted by the DPRK policy to [recruit] new supporters on the international stage in [Pyongyang’s] struggle for the reunification of the Korean people.We believe the visit was very successful, as evidenced in the agenda of the meetings, as well as in the attention granted by the Pakistanis [to the North Korean delegation]; neither the US nor the leadership in Seoul approved of this visit, who made their reservations known in their discussions with General Zia.Overall, the success of the visit proves the diversification and the consolidation of good relations not only between the two countries, but also between China (as a great power with strategic interests in Asia), Pakistan, and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. The two superpowers, the US and the USSR, who are just as interested in maintaining control over and [preserving] a balance of forces in Asia, are closely following the evolution of these triangular relations, and they are manifestly worried [about them].SignedLucian Petrescu\n",

      "To the 2nd Direction, RelationsOn 3 April, on the occasion of a meeting with Kim Yeong-nam [Kim Yong Nam], the head of the International Section of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers’ Party, he discussed some of the reasons for which, at the latest meeting of the Coordinating Committee, the DPRK had insisted on the measures meant to bring about a relaxation of military tensions and a transformation of the Korean armistice into a peace treaty.Therefore, he mentioned that since the Vietnam War had ended and since there was a real opportunity to find a political solution to the Korean matter, certain dissensions sprung up within the top echelons of power in Seoul, especially in military circles. Park Chung Hee, Lee Hu-rak, the head of the Korean Central Intelligence Agency, and several other reactionary elements, with the support of the USA and Japan, were increasingly moving towards the right and in order to maintain their current positions, they were breaking up the process of unification into time sequences. This group is supported by South Korean generals, recently returned from Vietnam, who are instigating against North Korea “to unite the country by defeating communism,” etc. These dissensions amongst military cadres grew also as a consequence of the prospects of a reduction in military aid from the United States, which may impact on the material situation and morale of the South Korean army, which would create great uncertainty for career officers in the South Korean military. As a result of this upheaval amongst militaries, Park Chung Hee was recently compelled to remove from office one of his closest friends, i.e. the head of the Seoul garrison, and several other generals, justifying his decision by stating that they did not present enough trustworthiness. On the other hand, a certain deviation towards the left is growing increasingly prominent, as displayed by a large number of intellectuals and a great share of militaries, motivated primarily by patriotic feelings, who are more realistic about the possibilities to overcome clashes and differences that have piled on through the years, as a result of the different political systems in the two parts of Korea.I managed to gather from Kim Yeong-nam’s remarks that the recent proposals of the DPRK were meant to stimulate the leftist trends in South Korea, the aggravation of the internal contradictions which exist in the Seoul administration and military circles and only lastly [they aimed at] adopting some practical measures to achieve a relaxation of military tensions.My interlocutor mentioned that the DPRK would not be able to get along with Park Chung Hee because of his total submission to American and Japanese interests. Kim Yeong-nam hinted at the fact that the DPRK, by launching its well-known proposals, including the proposal referring to signing a peace treaty, wishes to put the South Korean authorities in a delicate position, one in which they cannot accept any of those proposals but at the same time in which they cannot interrupt the dialogue. Although unable to obtain any concrete successes through cooperation, the North Koreans are winning many followers amongst the opponents of Park Chung Hee, who will help the North Koreans topple the current regime in Seoul.Getting involved in economic, cultural-social exchanges with the South Koreans would only have created more problems and politically it would have been more efficient for the South, which would have used this [opportunity] as a foundation for its separatist tendencies, arguing that the North Koreans recognize South Korea as an economic and commercial partner.Signed: Dumitru Popa\n",

      "제2관계국4월 3일 조선로동당 중앙위원회 국제관계부 부장 김영남과의 회담에서, 김영남은 조절위원회의 최근 회담에서 조선민주주의인민공화국이 어떠한 이유로 군사 긴장을 완화하고 조선의 휴전을 평화조약으로 변화시키는 방안을 고집했는지에 대해 이야기했다.그는 베트남전의 종결과 조선/한국 문제에 대한 정치적 해결책 발굴의 현실적 기회 존재로 인해 서울의 권력층, 특히 군부 사이에서 어떠한 알력이 생겨났다고 말했다. 박정희와 중앙정보부 국장 이후락, 그리고 기타 몇몇 반동분자들은 미국과 일본의 지원을 받아 우측으로 움직이고 있었으며 또한 그들의 현상유지를 위하여 통일 절차를 시간차로 나누고 있었다. 이들 단체는 최근 베트남에서 돌아온 남조선 장교들의 지지를 받고 있으며 이 장교들은 “사회주의 박멸을 통한 통일” 등으로 북조선에 부정적인 의견을 부추기고 있다. 이와 같은 군사간부 사이의 불화는 미국으로부터의 군사지원 축소 가능성으로 인해 심화되었는데, 이와 같은 변화가 물질적 형편과 남조선 군의 사기 저하를 가지고 와 남측 직업군인들에게 큰 불안정을 가져올 수 있기 때문이다. 이러한 군 간부 사이의 격변의 결과로 최근 박정희는 그의 가장 가까운 친구 중 하나인 수도방위사령관과 기타 몇몇 장군들을 믿음직하지 않다는 사유로 자리에서 내쳤다.반면 애국심으로 가득한 많은 지식인과 상당한 군 간부들 사이에서는 좌측으로의 움직임이 상당히 증가하고 있다. 이들은 두 조선의 정치체계 차이로 인해 수년간 쌓여 온 충돌과 차이 극복 가능성에 대해 보다 현실적이다.나는 김영남의 발언으로부터 조선민주주의인민공화국의 최근 제안은 남측의 좌파 경향, 서울 행정부와 군사관료 사이에 존재하는 내부 갈등을 고무하고자 한 것이며, [그리고 마지막으로] 군사긴장 상태를 완화하고자 하는 일부 현실적 대안 채택임을 알아챘다.나의 소식통에 의하면 조선민주주의인민공화국은 미국과 일본에게 완전히 복종하는 박정희와는 잘 지내지 못할 것이라고 한다. 김영남은 조선민주주의인민공화국이 평화조약 체결과 관련된 제안을 포함, 그들의 잘 알려진 제안 개시를 통해 남측 관료들이 이 제안들을 받아들이지도 그렇다고 대화를 중단할 수도 없는 민감한 상황에 놓이도록 하고자 한다고 귀띔했다. 협력을 통해 어떠한 뚜렷한 성공을 거둘 수는 없겠지만 북조선인들은 박정희의 반대파 사이에서 많은 지지자를 얻을 수 있을 것이며 이들은 북조선으로 하여금 서울 정부를 꺾는 데에 도움이 될 것이다.남조선사람들과 경제적, 사회문화적 교류를 나누는 것은 더 많은 문제를 낳을 뿐이며 정치적으로는 북조선이 남측을 경제, 상업적 동반자로 여긴다고 주장하며 이 [기회]를 분리주의적 경향의 기반으로 사용했을 지 모를 남측에 보다 효율적이었을 수 있다. 서명: Dumitru Popa\n",

      "수신: 제1관계국Aurelian Lazăr 와 I. Fadeev 소련 참사관의 대화 후, 우리는 다음의 문제들에 주목하였다:1. 평양의 소련 외교관은 한국의 통일문제에 대해 서울과 다수의 직접적 접촉 방안을 점차 포기해오던 조선민주주의인민공화국의 입장에 일부 변화가 일어나 남북조절위원회와 적십자 대표단에서 실질적 결과가 없는 형식적인 대화만을 유지하고 있다고 결론지었다. I. Fadeev는 조선민주주의인민공화국이 최근 눈에 띄게 증가한 것과 같이, 그들의 입장에 대외적 지지와 눈에 띄게 공개적인 남한의 고립, 서울의 내부갈등 고조에 대해 신뢰하고 있다고 말했다. 그는 현재 상황에서 남측 관료들은 내부의 어려움을 악화시키지 않기 위해 대외적으로 지원을 구하는 방안을 취할 수 밖에 없다고 말했다. 2. 남조선에서 미군 철수에 관해, I. Fadeev는 이것이 장기적인 절차이며 중화인민공화국의 약속에 따라 매우 긍정적인 시각을 가지고 있던 조선민주주의인민공화국이 이제 미국의 남조선 철수를 유도하고 유엔통일부흥위원회의 이용을 막겠다는 북경 관료들의 진실성에 대해 의구심과 두려움을 가지고 있다고 이야기했다. 그는 조선민주주의인민공화국 외무상 허담이 3월 말 A. Gromyko와의 대화에서 [중국] 수상 저우언라이가 일본 의회 앞에서 중화인민공화국은 아시아에서 미군의 퇴각에 아직 관심이 없다고 한 발언에 대해 이야기 했다는 것을 지적하며 자신의 의견을 뒷받침하였다. 위에서 말한 모든 내용을 통해 우리는 평양주재 소련 외교관이 중화인민공화국의 선의와 진심에 대해 조선민주주의인민공화국은 신뢰가 없고 의심을 하고 있다는 사실에 주목하고 있다는 것을 알았다.3. 1973년 9월 모스크바에서 열릴 유니버시아드에 대하여 조선민주주의인민공화국 대표단은 소련에게 남한 대표의 불참을 요구하였다. 유니버시아드가 국제 포럼을 통해 구성된 것이며, 소비에트연방은 단지 이 행사의 주최국이기 때문에 남조선의 참가 저지에는 장애가 있을 것으로 예상된다. 그러나 소련은 남조선이 소비에트연방국에 입국하는 것을 최대한 저지할 것이다. 현재 상황에서 소련은 조선민주주의인민공화국에 북과 남을 통합한 단일선수단을 구성하여 행사에 참가하는 방안을 고려하라고 요구하고 있다. I. Fadeev의 표현에 따르면 아직 이 제안에 답을 받지는 못했지만 조선민주주의인민공화국이 이를 달가워하지 않는 것 같다고 한다. 서명: Dumitru Popa\n",

      "To the First Directorate – RelationsWith respect to the second session of the DPRK Supreme People’s Assembly which took place between April 5 -10, we would like to inform you about the following matters:At the session, in addition to matters related to the unification of the country, which were comprised in a letter addressed to all legislatures and governments in the world, including the Congress of the United States (the aforementioned letter was sent to the MFA HQ), several other issues related to the economic and social development of the country were on the agenda. Therefore, the recent session of the Supreme People’s Assembly passed a law regarding the extension of the mandatory 10-year educational system which includes one year in preschool to the national level; this law will be enforced starting with the 1972-1973 academic year. Preschool education will be enforced at the national level until the beginning of the 1976-1977 academic year.With respect to the state budget for 1973, estimated at 8.543.510.000 won, this figure shows an increase by 16.9 percent compared to last year’s budget (which was 7.4 billion won, approximately $3.3 billion). For the year 1973, a crucial year for the accomplishment of the entire 6-year plan of the DPRK, it is planned to allocate increased shares of the budget for heavy industry, machine building industry, extraction industry and energy industry. Additional investments will be made in the chemical industry, light industry and consumer goods industry, with the specific purpose of raising the standard of living of the population.If military expenses amounted to 17 percent of the 1972 budget, for 1973, the military budget will be 15 percent of the total (1.282.000.000 won, the equivalent of $577 million).While taking part in the Supreme People’s Assembly session, we gathered that because of the open nature of this session, the event had a praising purpose, less critical of the existing shortcomings, displaying a weak disposition towards making criticisms and self-criticisms [for current problems]. Only after the repeated interventions of Comrade Kim Il Sung did they manage to overcome this situation, stimulating criticism and self-criticism, [summoning] the courage to tackle deficiencies and to find solutions to remedy or overcome hardships.Throughout the discussions we noticed the existence of certain deficiencies in the planning system, a weak activity of the economic and financial control bodies, etc., which, as Comrade Kim Il Sung mentioned in his short speech ending the session, lead to a certain state of stagnation, weak rhythm and poor correlation of economic sectors, which in turn, had negative repercussions on the entire national economy.During the session various shy references were made to the persistence of routine, fear to innovate—all of which are generated by the deficient technical and scientific training [of the workers].We also noticed that in budget report and throughout the discussions on it no mention had been made regarding the issue of collaborating or cooperating on economic and technological-scientific matters with outside [partners].Signed:Dumitru Popa\n",

      "TELEGRAM 066567To: the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to comrade Constantin OanceaFrom: the Romanian Embassy in PyongyangSubject: Bilateral relations between the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the Socialist Federal Republic of YugoslaviaDate: April 13, 1977 Classification: Secreti. During March 29th and April 5th this year, the Yugoslav governmental delegation led by Mara Radic – member of Government, President of the Yugoslav team in the advisory commission on intergovernmental economic, technological and scientific relations between the DPRK and the SFRY – was in Pyongyang. Given this opportunity, the first session of the aforementioned commission took place and the following [documents] have been [signed]: the first protocol of the session, a long-term trade agreement for 1977-1980, and a trade protocol for 1977. During its stay in the DPRK, the Yugoslav delegation enjoyed special attention from Korean officials, was received by Korean Premier Pak Seong-cheol [Pak Song Chol] and visited various economic and social-cultural sites in Pyongyang and Hamheung.Although the delegation’s mission was primarily economic, Korean officials sought to imprint a pronounced political character on it, and discuss not only economic matters but also aspects related to a long-term development of political bilateral relations and other issues. During the official and unofficial discussions, the Korean side emphasized the need to intensify activity within the Non-Aligned Movement in order to solve major current issues. On this occasion, Pak Seong-cheol showed that currently the main problem within the Non-Aligned Movement is maintaining unity amongst its member states, this being highly important especially given that the imperial powers are carrying out an intense activity to divide these states and undermine the movement.   The Yugoslav delegation remarked that its Korean counterpart did not make any reference to either Third World or developing countries. Discussing issues related to a new world economic and political order, the Yugoslav delegation wanted to know the DPRK’s stance in regards to Pakistani Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto’s initiative of a high-level Third World countries conference. The Korean delegation avoided the answer, only mentioning that, presently, it is necessary to meet the conditions agreed upon in 1976 at Colombo.On receiving the Yugoslav delegation by Premier Pak Seong-cheol and, particularly, during official discussions with Kong Jin-tae [Kong Jin Tae], both parties emphasized that bilateral economic relations are not commensurate with political ones. It was pointed out that neither party had made sufficient efforts to accomplish the tasks and agreements reached during Kim Il Sung's visit to Belgrade. It is necessary for the appropriate bodies in both countries to actively work towards developing trade and technological and scientific cooperation, thus also enacting the decisions agreed upon at Colombo in 1976. The Korean delegation expressed its conviction that the Yugoslav delegation's visit to the DPRK will contribute to the substantial improvement of economic bilateral relations. The Yugoslav delegation appreciates that the visit has been extremely helpful. The first session of the intergovernmental commission established the judicial framework of the commercial, technological and scientific relations between the two countries.   The Yugoslav party manifested an interest in substantially enlarging cooperation in terms of production with the DPRK. In turn, the DPRK was particularly interested in the matter. ii. During discussions for signing the first protocol of the intergovernmental commission, the following issues have been discussed: a) The DPRK wishes to obtain from the SFRY, or via the SFRY from the German Democratic Republic, the technology of coke production using anthracite coal. The Yugoslav delegation claims there is no such technology in the SFRY. However, in cooperation with the Korean specialists who are about to arrive in Belgrade, all possibilities will be examined.b) Cooperation between the two countries in the production of diesel locomotives – each will produce certain components and will trade specialists;c) Technical cooperation in naval construction. The DPRK will import ship engines from SFRY. We remind that several years ago the DPRK had imported from Yugoslavia 20 such engines, of a total worth of 5,500,000 pounds sterling, without reimbursement. The Yugoslav delegation required a payment of one million pounds sterling this year, with the remained to be reimbursed in a five-year installment plan after a period of 18 months from the first payment. The proposal is under review. d) The DPRK wishes to obtain technical documentation for the production of ships employed in deep-water oil extraction. The Yugoslav delegation explained that SFRY does not dispose of its own vessels and uses highly expensive Swedish ships for these purposes. Recommendations will be made for an appropriate Yugoslav organization to assist DPRK in the matter.iii. The long-term agreement stipulates: a) DPRK exports: machinery and other equipment worth a total of 1,000,000 pounds sterling; 44,000 tons of iron and steel products; 25,000 tons of electrolytic zinc; 140 tons of cadmium; 66,000 pounds sterling worth of chemical products; 460,000 pounds sterling worth of commercial goods; 40,000 tons of rice; 26,000 tons of freshly frozen fish; 950 tons of the common hop. b) DPRK imports: machinery and other equipment – no final figures have been established; 20,000 tons of iron and steel products; 5,700 tons of aluminum and aluminum products; 450 tons of brass; 10,800 tons of chemical substances – insecticides, herbicides, etc.; 450 tons of concentrate feeds; 640,000 pounds sterling worth of chemical fertilizers; 2,000 tons of various types of paper, including rolling paper.iv. The trade protocol for 1977 stipulates an extra hundred tons of tobacco and feathers in the Korean export to Yugoslavia, in addition to the long-term agreement. Information based on V.

Kunaev, member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the CPSU (January 1978) remain in a good state, experiencing a relative progress compared with previous years. Therefore in 1977, almost 30 Soviet delegations at various levels visited the DPRK, and approximately 40 Korean delegations visited the USSR. Since last year, 6 Soviet delegations (filmmakers, labor union leaders, economic delegations, academics, youth delegations, civil aviation delegations) visited the DPRK and 4 Korean delegations (O Jin-u, the North Korean minister of the People’s Armed Forces, the association of engineers and technicians, an economic delegation and a sports delegation) visited the USSR.Currently, Korean-Soviet negotiations on the signing of the commercial protocol for 1978 have been going on in Moscow for several months. The [Soviet diplomat] said that the negotiations are proceeding with difficulty, because, among other things, the Soviets insist that the balance of trade is balanced.A. Belyi said that starting on April 9th, 1978, the DPRK Ministry of External Economic Affairs delegation, led by Liu Kan-won [sic], the Head of the Policy Planning Department, will come to Moscow to discuss with the Soviet authorities the completion rate of the [A.L.D] (for 1976-1980), the prospects until 1980, including the use of the loan given by the USSR in February 1976.Moreover, at the end of May or June, a delegation of the DPRK State Planning Committee is due to visit Moscow to discuss the matter regarding commercial exchanges and economic and technical-scientific cooperation between the two countries between 1981 and 1984, respectively the last 4 years of DPRK’s 7-year development plan.[The Soviet diplomat] said that currently, one could talk about a general improvement in Soviet-Korean relations.When making this assessment, A. Belyi added, ‘we take into account the future visit to Moscow of President Kim Il Sung.’ The Soviet diplomat said that the Korean and Soviet ministries of foreign affairs have been recently given the task to agree on a period when President Kim Il Sung’s visit will take place. Until now, there is no clear date; there are rumors among the members of the diplomatic corps that the aforementioned visit could take place between August and September 1978.SignedDumitru Popa\n",

Over the last few years both the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and South Korea showed a particular interest in intensifying their relations with Indonesia especially in the economic domain. In addition to several other objectives, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and South Korea’s actions regarding Indonesia, as well as other states in Asia aim to counter the initiatives of the other side. At the end of February, a governmental delegation led by the Vice Premier, Kong Jin-tae, Minister of External Economic Affairs of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, paid a visit to Indonesia where he discussed matters regarding the development of commercial relations between the two countries. In April, a South Korean delegation led by a deputy of the minister of the foreign trade might pay a visit to Indonesia. During 1976 and partially during 1977 the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s relations with Indonesia passed through a stagnant period as a result of the contacts that the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea had with representatives of the East Timor. The minister of defense of East Timor made a visit to Pyongyang on January 3rd 1976, however commercial relations between the DPRK and Indonesia have significantly improved over the past 7-8 years. In 1977 exports from the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to Indonesia amounted to 15,244,068 US dollars and the imports to 225,997 dollars.The main Korean products that were exported were lathes, steel, products of the heavy and light industries, agricultural products, especially rice – about 100,000 tons were exported in 1977. According to the [terms of the economic] agreement between the two countries, rice exports in 1978 will reach 200,000 tons.On the occasion of his visit to Jakarta, Kong Jin-tae, asked the Indonesian Minister of Foreign Trade to diversify the goods exported to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, and to export products like: nickel, cooper, wood, rubber, magnesium, pewter and petroleum as well, in order to adjust the balance of trade between the two countries. The commercial relations issues will be discussed thoroughly in the near future, on the occasion of the visit in Pyongyang of an Indonesian trade delegation.(Analysis written on the basis of Victor Nanu’s conversations with Umar Hussein, the Minister- Counselor of the Indonesian Embassy and Davinder Singh, First Secretary of the Indian Embassy in Pyongyang.)

      "TELEGRAM 066.644To: the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Comrade Ion Ciubotaru)From: the Romanian Embassy in PyongyangDate: April 22nd, 1978 Classification: SecretIn a conversation with A. Bulcu, G. Kuti, the Second Secretary of the Hungarian Embassy in Pyongyang, informed the Romanian diplomat that the President of the Central Committee of the Japanese Socialist Party, Asukata, will arrive in Pyongyang in the next few days. This visit of the new leader of the JSP – after his recent visit to Beijing in March 1978, has the following two objectives:First, he intends to obtain the agreement of the North Koreans to extend the agreement signed on September 1977 in Pyongyang, between a Japanese parliamentary delegation and the Korean authorities, regarding the permission for the Japanese ships to fish in the territorial waters of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, in the 200-mine economic area. Because the validity of the agreement signed last year expires on June 30th, the Japanese government hopes to convince the Korean authorities, with Asukata’s help, to allow Japanese ships to continue their activities in the territorial waters of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.Secondly, his presence in Pyongyang is a great opportunity for the Korean authorities to accomplish an important foreign policy objective of the Korean government – organizing the second International Conference of Solidarity with the fight of the Korean people for the of the country in Tokyo, this fall. Since there are clues that the Japanese government does not approve of organizing this meeting, the Korean authorities are concerned but also determined to do anything in their power to organize this meeting in Tokyo as it was decided at the ending of the first meeting that took place last year in Brussels.Given the situation, the Korean authorities will condition the extension of the fishing agreement on the agreement of the Japanese government regarding the organization of second international meeting regarding the Korean problem.SignedDumitru Popa\n",

      "To the First Direction, RelationsWith respect to inter-Korean relations, we would like to draw your attention to the fact that when important events, reunions, or contacts take place, provocations and sometimes serious incidents resulting in casualties spring up systematically in the demilitarized zone. By infringing on the commitments mutually agreed upon through the Joint Communiqué of July 1972, the situation is growing tense and the smooth development of the inter-Korean dialogue is hindered. Therefore, on 23 April, at the request of the Americans in the Armistice Commission a session took place at Panmunjeom, where the DPRK was charged with sending a group of spies in South Korea on the night of 17 April (3 people, 2 of whom were shot in the Southern part of the demilitarized zone) and was accused of not accepting to investigate this case jointly.Although the North Koreans publicly denounced this setting-up, the arguments they invoked were not convincing and categorical enough, which provided the authorities in Seoul and the Americans with plenty of ammunition to condemn the DPRK for “its duplicitous policies, aiming at winning the support of public opinion by charging the South and the Americans [for various things], while in reality being the one committing the provocations and perpetuating a state of tension on the Korean Peninsula.”In these circumstances, we believe that the second meeting of the South-North Coordinating Committee Secretariat, planned for 24 April in Panmunjeom, will unfold in a tense atmosphere.Irrespective of its authors, the aforementioned incident, as all the others from previous months, provide supportive arguments for the continued stationing of US troops in South Korea, and reasons for easily combating against the letters adopted at the recent session of the Supreme People’s Assembly addressed to the US Senate and House of Representatives.Signed: Dumitru Popa\n",

      "TELEGRAM 066700To: the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to comrade Constantin Oancea and Ion CiubotaruFrom: the Romanian Embassy in PyongyangSubject: Bilateral relations between the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the German Democratic RepublicDate: August 15, 1977Classification: SecretReferring to the current state of GDR-DPRK relations, the GDR Ambassador to Pyongyang Franz Everharz recently recounted the following to Ambassador Dumitru Popa:The East German government attaches particular attention to its relations with the DPRK. This includes the planned visit to Pyongyang of the party and government delegation led by E. Honecker.On this occasion, the GDR would like to have a high-level discussion regarding the development of socialism in the two countries and their foreign policies. The East Germans want to present in detail its position regarding relations with the FRG and West Berlin, and regarding German reunification. Something is currently preventing the GDR from placing the issue of reunification at the heart of its foreign policy. Although in certain aspects of foreign policy [in East Germany], the GDR and the DPRK have divergent views, the GDR believes a high-level meeting would strengthen the friendly and collaborative relations between the two countries. We [would like to] mention that so far the exact date of the visit has not been established. Although the DPRK is also preoccupied with and interested in developing its relations with the GDR, it is not active enough in fulfilling its obligations, particularly on the economic [front]. What is notable, mentioned F. Everharz, is the fact that the DPRK had not used the credits granted by the GDR approximately 10 years ago, and would now wish to make use of them but according to the initial conditions included at the time. For example, in 1968, the two countries agreed to build an automation elements factory worth 16 million rubles. Part of the equipment, currently outdated, had been delivered, yet the construction did not begin. Currently, the DPRK requested that the GDR review the project, with up-to-date equipment, but at the prices agreed upon 10 years prior. The GDR responded that a request on such conditions cannot even be taken into consideration. On the other hand, the DPRK has a series of debts towards the GDR. For example, the debt for the transportation of Korean commodities using East German vessels amounts to 12 million Swiss francs. The GDR was compelled to reduce the trade frequency from a monthly basis to a bimonthly basis. The East German official claims that the DPRK currently pays more attention to fulfilling its obligations towards certain capitalist countries. For example, in 1976, the DPRK imported 15,000 US dollars’ worth of commodities from Finland and exported a total value of 250,000 US dollars, the difference counting towards paying a part of its debt to Finland. The 1977 commercial protocol between the GDR and the DPRK stipulates 13.5 million rubles worth of trade in commodities on both sides. An additional 5.4 million rubles will be added to the Korean side as overdue debt from 1976. Until July 31st 1977, the DPRK will deliver commodities worth 21% of its obligations for 1977 and 43% of its outstanding obligations for 1976. By June 30th 1977, the GDR exports to the DPRK are at 75% completion. Hitherto, the DPRK has not delivered any amount of lead, talc or electrolytic silver. The GDR is encountering several difficulties in fulfilling its assignments and obligations within the CMEA due to the DPRK’s unreliable delivery of electrolytic zinc. Nevertheless, the GDR is sympathetic towards the current economic hardships [in the DPRK] and expresses its conviction that the situation will normalize in a few years’ time. Everharz mentioned that the East Germans consider this visit should yield positive outcomes in all areas, contribute to overcoming current economic difficulties, strengthen the friendship and collaboration between the GDR and the DPRK, and, as such, the definitive date of the visit has not been yet agreed upon. Everharz further mentioned that E. Honecker will make an official visit to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam in December this year.    Signed: D. Popa\n",

Currently, the Korean official said, according to the rules established at the 25th session of the Armistice Commission on October 19th 1953, guards working in the Panmunjeom area cannot be provided with protection and [they] cannot be kept under control.At the 380th session of the Armistice Commission on August 25 [1976], held on the aforementioned topic, the representative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea proposed to abolish the outposts of one side on the territory of the other side, in the neutral area of Panmunjeom.This measure, according to Kim Yong-jip would lead to greater security in the area. With respect to the current situation in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Korean official assessed it as being “critical,” there being the possibility that at any given moment war breaks out.

He asks that Lee Hu-rak is replaced with somebody of national dignity, determined to dedicate itself to the cause of unification.The [DPRK] Deputy Foreign Minister expressed his hope that the Romanian government pays attention to the declaration signed by Co-president Kim Yeong-ju and will take supportive measures toward the position expressed in the document.He mentioned that the DPRK government would be grateful if the Romanian news agencies publish this document and other materials supporting the ideas present in it.We suggest that after receiving the document from the Korean Central Telegraph Agency, our news agencies publish a summary of the declaration and a commentary on it.We would like to add that while other chiefs of missions in Pyongyang received this brief collectively, the Soviet, Chinese and Romanian ambassadors were invited separately.Signed: Dumitru Popa\n",

The [North] Koreans planned an elaborate schedule two weeks prior: the Hungarian Minister is to be received by Kim Il Sung, discussions, visits to social, economic and cultural attractions in Pyongyang, and visits to Kangwon province, Kaesong, and even Panmunjom. The two ministries signed, for the very first time, a collaboration agreement for 1977-1978 on this occasion. The agreement stipulates the various visits that will take place in 1977 and 1978 between the two ministries, which include Puja’s visit to the DPRK and Heo Dam’s visit to Hungary in 1978, an annual exchange between the Deputy Ministers of Foreign Affairs, and exchanges between the Divisions Directors of the ministries (no particular divisions specified). Furthermore, a plan for cultural and scientific collaboration 1977-1978 between the two countries was also signed by the Vice Presidents of the Committees for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries. During discussions between the two ministers, F. Puja amply exposed Hungary’s foreign policy, aspects of the political situation in Europe in the context of Comrade János Kádár’s visits to Rome, Bonn and Vienna, papers of the preparatory conference in Belgrade on European security etc. In turn, Heo Dam emphasized that relations between the DPRK and Hungary are ‘excellent’ and continuously improving. During the first 7 months of this year, the DPRK has been visited by 21 Hungarian delegations from various divisions, and 20 [North] Korean delegations have visited Hungary. Referring to internal issues, the [North] Korean official noted that, among others, the internal economic situation is overall good. The current economic hardships both internally and in relation to other countries are due to the division [of Korea], which requires high defense costs, to unfavorable climatic conditions, to the economic crises in capitalist countries, and to other ‘difficulties inherent in our economic development.’ All these difficulties, mentions Heo Dam, shall be overcome. Furthermore, he claimed that the DPRK is currently working on finalizing the Seven-Year Plan for 1978-1984. Within this context, a series of aspects of the future plan for economic and social development were presented (see President Kim Il Sung’s interview with Japanese newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun – Rodong Sinmun – April 30 1977). In regards to the situation in the Korean Peninsula, Heo Dam mentioned that the US is strengthening their military presence in the region under various pretexts, including American troop withdrawal from South Korea. Expressing gratitude to the Hungarian government for supporting the Korean national cause, Heo Dam asked Hungary to continue its support for Korean reunification and uphold its policy of diplomatic non-recognition towards South Korea, to counter the so-called cross-recognition theory, to oppose UN membership of two Koreas, etc. The DPRK’s well-known position regarding reunification was discussed in detail. Heo Dam reported that the DPRK will not propose a new resolution project at the next UN General Assembly and will work towards enacting the one adopted in 1975. According to some sources, neither will South Korea; however, if it does propose a new project, the DPRK is prepared to act accordingly.Referring to certain aspects of the situation in Asia, Heo Dam noted among others that the DPRK strongly supports the people’s struggle in Indochina and all progressive movements on the continent. Within such a context, he mentioned that American imperialists seek to use ASEAN as a means of aggression against progressive movements in Asia. Recently, Japan has manifested an increasing interest in ASEAN countries, seeking to fulfill its ancient dream of becoming a leader within Asia, particularly on an economic level. The Fukuda Doctrine, according to Heo Dam, is an economic doctrine which ‘mirrors Japan’s policy of economic infiltration in Asia.’Referring to the recent changes in India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, the [North] Korean official noted that these are the product of struggles with right-wing forces supported by American imperialism in order to gain state power. In regards to relations among socialist countries, Heo Dam spoke in favor of their unity and against all actions leading to their division and separation. He noted that it is ‘particularly encouraging that the DPRK has good relations with both the USSR and the People’s Republic of China.’ ‘The DPRK is pleased that, despite the current differences between the USSR and PRC, the two are rightfully supporting Korea’s reunification.’ The [North] Korean official expressed gratitude and welcomed the Hungarian government’s prohibition of South Korean participation in all international meetings organized in Hungary, and asked that Hungary continue this in the future. F. Puja explained that they can only act in this manner when the organizer is Hungary. Concurrently, he reassured the DPRK that Hungary will do everything possible to prevent South Korean envoys from participating at international meetings when appropriate. In case of participation, suitable measures will be taken through the Ministry of Internal Affairs in regards to granting visas and other specific conditions in order to avoid any inconveniences that could be directed against North Korean representatives.     Regarding the Korean peninsula, President Kim Il Sung mentioned that the situation remains tense, with US imperialists preparing for a new war in Korea. ‘The propaganda about American troop withdrawal from South Korea is a scam, a lie.’ In fact, the United States is strengthening its military presence in the region. According to Kim Il Sung, the reunification plan requires, among others, substantial popular support from South Korea, where progressive movements are developing. Given the complexity of the situation in the peninsula, according to Kim Il Sung, the issue of the reunification [of the country] is not resolvable overnight, but long-lasting and enduring. Referring to issues of the international arena, President Kim Il Sung mentioned that ‘the DPRK maintains and develops bilateral relations with Third World countries in order to spread socialism, not to alienate socialist countries.’ The Hungarian Embassy in Pyongyang considers that the Minister’s visit to the DPRK has been successful in all respects. The visit concluded with a press release agreed upon by both parties without difficulties.Summary based on discussions between Ambassador Dumitru Popa and M. Macuch, Ambassador of SRC, and between V. Nanu and S. Pataki, PHR chargé d'affaires ad interim in Pyongyang. Signed: D. Popa \n",

      "TELEGRAM 066.566To: the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (comrade Director Ion Ciubotaru)From: the Romanian Embassy in PyongyangSubject: DPRK-PRC relationsDate: February 2nd, 1978 Classification: SecretThe DPRK’s relations with the PRC, a neighboring country, with [a record] of cooperation and traditional friendly relations, a great power with influence in the region and in the world [in general], [is given] particular attention in the foreign policy of the Korean government, having a special place in the foreign relations of the DPRK.[Judging] by the number of delegations, the level and attention with which these delegations are received [reciprocally], the magnitude of celebrations marking historic events and the [achievements] of the peoples of the two countries, mutual promotion, the PRC enjoys one of the top positions in DPRK’s foreign relations with other countries.  Six of the approximately 10 Chinese official delegations which visited the DPRK in 1977, among which two were delegations of the Sino-Korean Friendship Association, the delegation of Xinhua [news] agency, the military delegation, the delegation of the telecommunications ministry, etc., were received by President Kim Il Sung (the largest number of delegations received in one year from one single country).Moreover, several Korean delegations which visited the PRC – the Workers’ Party of Korea delegation, led by Kim Gi-nam, member of the Central Committee of the Workers’ Party of Korea, editor-in-chief of Nodong Sinmun, the delegation of the Academy of Science of the DPRK – were received  by people in the party and government leadership of the PRC. Such receptions are regarded as reciprocal special attention given to delegations, to relations between the two countries.The PRC has promptly reacted to DPRK initiatives regarding the reunification of Korea, offering constant support to the Korean government’s position on the reunification of the motherland.Although on average the DPRK pays great attention to its relations with the PRC, we noticed that in its foreign relations, the DPRK seeks to preserve some sort of equilibrium in its relations with the PRC and the USSR, alternatively tilting towards one and the other (a [phenomenon] which can be [measured] in the number of contacts, their level, the attention with which delegations are received, the portrayal of such visits in the media, etc.). At the same time we noticed that the positive political attitude and appraisal given by the DPRK towards PRC’s policies have constant preponderance.[Judging by] the available information, one can say that, overall, political Korean-Chinese relations are better than Korean-Soviet relations, which Korean-Soviet relations are richer than Korean-Chinese relations in other sectors.With respect to Sino-Korean economic relations, in a conversation with Ambassador Dumitru Popa, the Chinese Ambassador to Pyongyang, Lü Zhixian stated that these [economic relations] do not meet the level of political relations between the two countries.After tedious negotiations, in March 1977, [the DPRK and the PRC] signed a long-term agreement for 1977-1981. The volume of Sino-Korean trade reached approximately 630 million Swiss francs, out of the total 820 million Swiss francs, with China covering 330 million Swiss francs out of the total 400 million Swiss francs it committed to, and the Koreans covering 303 million Swiss francs out of the total 420 million Swiss francs it committed to. Chinese export dues were caused by the hardship [encountered by] China’s economy after the 1976 earthquake and the internal economic strife triggered by the actions of the ‘Gang of Four.’Currently, the PRC is granting the DPRK technical assistance with building a refinery with an annual capacity of 1.5 million tons of crude (a quantity annually exported by China to the DPRK).The Koreans are pushing the Chinese to increase crude exports to the DPRK, but the PRC is not in a position to give an affirmative answer (crude consumption per capita in the DPRK is higher than crude consumption per capita in China).Currently, negotiations on the signing of the Korean-Chinese commercial protocol for 1978 are being carried out. The main issue is the pricing mechanism.As far as [the future development] of Korean-Chinese relations are concerned, we believe that as no major changes will occur in the region, these relations will have a normal evolution, in accordance with the past record.SignedDumitru Popa\n",

Pyongyang says it was a fishing vessel while Seoul claims it was an armed vessel, which, together with a group of military vessels went into the South Korean territorial waters.Navy and Air Force units from both sides were deployed during this incident. In order to expedite the succession of events, an American Phantom Fighter jets escadrille intervened.

Both sides asked for the urgent summoning of the Panmunjeom Military Armistice Commission. After this incident, which began on February 26th in the afternoon, a state of tension, almost incandescent, emerged: decision-makers in South Korea ordered the general mobilization [of the armed forces] and they are keeping air, navy and army units in the impact areas with North Korea in a state of alert.The Democratic People's Republic of Korea is using this incident to intensify its campaign against the Seoul authorities and the US presence in South Korea, to intensify the disorder which dominates Seoul and within the South Korean military leadership.We will inform you separately on the official position of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.Signed: Dumitru Popa\n",

Kunaev – the first secretary of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan, and member of the CPSU Politburo, recounted how during the Korean-Soviet talks (the Korean delegation was led by Pak Seong-cheol, member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Workers’ Party of Korea, Vice-President of the DPRK, the two delegations talked about the construction of socialism in the two countries and bilateral relations. ‘Given the divergent views of the two parties on some key matters, my interlocutor added, [the two delegations] avoided tackling such topics on, which [meant] that the talks unfolded without any impediments.’ Kim Gil-hyeon pointed out that this delegation was supposed to come to the DPRK on the occasion of the anniversary of the Great Socialist Revolution in October, but the Soviets sent another delegation, at an inferior level, on November 7th. Although the two countries have exchanged delegations on the occasion of November 7th, 1977, the Soviets requested that the aforementioned delegation visit the DPRK. ‘The [North] Koreans, Kim Gil-hyeon added, thought that, if [the Soviets] requested, then this delegation must be received accordingly.’Referring to the Lenin order awarded by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR to President Kim Il Sung on the occasion of his 60th birthday, the [North Korean] interlocutor said: ‘the decision was taken 6 years ago. But since then, there have been no high-level official visits to the DPRK.Now the Soviets decided that the aforementioned delegation gives President Kim Il Sung the order in question. We had to accept so that they did not return with it to the USSR.’ At [Ambassador Popa’s] question whether the visit of D. Kunaev is regarded as a response to Pak Seong-cheol’s invitation (Pak Seong-cheol visited the USSR in January 1977), Kim Gil-hyeon said that ‘we appreciate that the head of the Soviet delegation is, first and foremost, the first secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party in Kazakhstan and then a member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the CPSU.’ [Judging by the articles published] in the North Korean press, which released many materials about the visit, it could be noticed the official, reserved tone of [North Korea’s] assessment of the unfolding and content of the visit.In conclusion, we can say that the [North] Koreans were unsatisfied with the level of the delegation, as well as with the fact that [the visit] did not tackle [any] special problems which could influence in any way the dynamics of Korean-Soviet relations.SignedDumitru Popa\f\n",

Glinski, recounted that both the Polish and the Korean parties have been very pleased with the Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs Wladyslaw Wojtasik’s visit to the DPRK. The DPRK has advertised this visit more than usual since it was at the beginning of the ‘month of solidarity with the Korean people’ and because the Polish Minister had made ample declarations in support of a peaceful reunification and Korean independence, immediate and complete withdrawal of US troops from South Korea, etc. The Polish diplomat noted that, during the visit, Comrade Kim Il Sung expressed his desire to meet with Comrade Edward Gierek, verbally renewing his invitation to visit DPRK. In addition to the general and well-known issues, President Kim Il Sung emphasized that the DPRK is currently in a difficult state due to the economic instability of 1976, when drought caused a decrease in electric energy production and, implicitly, an industrial slowdown. It was further mentioned that even today certain factories work only at 45-50% of their potential. Comrade Kim Il Sung assured the Polish officials that DPRK will overcome these difficulties and will do everything to acquit its financial obligations to foreign partners, particularly to the socialist countries.Wladyslaw Wojtasik agreed with his counterpart, Heo Dam [Ho Dam], to meet annually in the two capitals by rotation. Following that, in 1978 the DPRK’s Minister of Foreign Affairs will visit the PRP. Polish officials inquired whether the DPRK determined its stance regarding the potential inclusion of the Korean issue on the agenda of the next UN General Assembly. It can be inferred from the Korean Minister’s incomplete response that the DRPK will press for the enactment of the 1975 resolution on the matter.       Signed: D. Popa\n",

Presently, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is carefully studying the American proposal and in a very near future will present the UN with its point of view.Heo Dam mentioned that no point of the US proposal can be accepted as such by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the following reasons:  - the document is of a “reactionary and misleading” character. The worldwide public opinion could be induced to believe that the Americans are the one wishing for a dismantling of the UN headquarters in South Korea. In reality, the US will keep its presence in this country, while claiming its troops are not foreign. The US proposal aims in fact at obtaining the Democratic People's Republic of Korea’s agreement to US military presence and continuity in South Korea.- the American proposal aims at making South Korea visible on the international scene and increasing its prestige.

Moreover, Japan has invested significant capital in South Korea and presently has a good market there for its products.- the proposal that US and South Korean officers replace the leadership responsible for securing the ceasefire, as well as the presence of Chinese volunteers, would imply that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea accepts interference in its internal affairs from the past of great powers such as the US, the People’s Republic China, and would result in a breach of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea’s national independence and sovereignty. At the same time, US troops presence in South Korea would become permanent and implicitly so would “the continued existence of two Koreas.”- the US has proceeded with presenting its document, knowing that the fall of this year the UN General Assembly will adopt, with overwhelming majority, a resolution favorable to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.  Heo Dam has mentioned that his country does not see the document as a step back in the US position towards the Korean matter at the UN, and is therefore “a success of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.” In answering a question of the Romanian Ambassador, the Korean Foreign Affairs Minister noted that this year the Democratic People's Republic of Korea would send special delegations to numerous countries in the world, personal representatives of President Kim Il Sung, in order to explain in detail his country’s point of view in the Korean matter, as well as the position the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will adopt during the next UN General Assembly in order to ask for support, prevent the admission into the UN of two Koreas and diminish the effects of South Korean attempts to join the group of non-aligned countries.Signed: D.Popa\n",

The North Korean press objectively presented the facts, without any comments against the US. During discussions with Ambassador Dumitru Popa and Victor Nanu respectively, the Ambassadors of Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and the First Secretary of the Yugoslav Embassy in Pyongyang noted that the calm and extremely balanced attitude of the Korean government regarding the aforementioned incident reflects, among others, the DPRK’s efforts of creating favorable conditions for initiating dialogue with the US. The DPRK’s attitude vis-à-vis the July 14 incident is also considered significant in view of US Secretary of State Cyrus Vance’s forthcoming visit to Beijing and the potential contacts between the American delegation and North Korean officials. It is particularly notable that, in comparison to other incidents, military maneuvers etc. along the Military Demarcation Line, on July 14, North Korean authorities were, for the first time, calm, compliant and understanding. Evidently, this is partly due to the fact that the US assumed responsibility for the incident. We consider this to be a step further towards establishing favorable conditions for initiating a dialogue to solve the Korean question.   Signed: Dumitru Popa\n",

On the occasion of an audience granted to Victor Nanu at the [North] Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ri Seong-guk [sic], a head of department, said that the aforementioned visit took place in good conditions, yielding positive results for both parties.Starting from the fact that ‘the Mozambican government is pursuing an independent policy, that Mozambique is a sovereign country which is building socialism, that the FREELIMO party is a Marxist-Leninist party, the DPRK has had close relations with the People’s Republic of Mozambique,’ which, until now, have materialized, primarily, in frequent visit exchanges at various levels.At the same time, and for the same reasons, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea ‘has been providing and is ready to continue providing Mozambique with support in the building of the new society.’The Korean interlocutor said that the main purpose of the visit of the Mozambican delegation was to take note of the Korean experience regarding the methods and paths used by the DPRK to build the socialist society, to discuss and choose concrete methods of collaboration and mutual support between the two countries. Although endowed with important natural resources, Mozambique inherited a very low general level of development, as a result of colonial domination. For these reasons, the People’s Republic of Mozambique currently needs many cadres, especially technicians and engineers.Throughout the visit, President S. Machel sought to learn more about the Korean experience in training the cadres and asked for the support of the Korean government on this issue. The Mozambican delegation could have a first-hand experience of the DPRK’s practices on matters related to planning and coordinating economic activities, organizing the work [force], especially in agriculture, [and on matters related to] the results obtained in the work aimed at establishing a new society, etc.At the end of the visit, the following documents were signed: a friendship and cooperation treaty between the DPRK and the People’s Republic of Mozambique, a joint communique, a cultural and technical-scientific cooperation agreement, a commercial agreement, and an economic and technical cooperation convention.With respect to some of Victor Nanu’s questions, the Korean diplomat added that the documents signed [by the two sides] were ‘framework-documents.’ On the occasion of the conversations between the two presidents, it was agreed that afterwards, frequent delegation exchanges would take place, with the aim of studying and analyzing cooperation possibilities, ways, and methods, and respectively, to provide Mozambique with the support [it needs] in the agreed-upon fields, so that afterwards the necessary documents are signed, and the things agreed upon in principle on the occasion of the aforementioned visit materialize.The Koreans think that the visit was useful, that it represents a ‘new phase and an important contribution to the consolidation of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea-Mozambique friendship and cooperation.’SignedAmbassador Dumitru Popa\n",

      "TELEGRAMSender: PyongyangCLASSIFICATION: SECRETRegularDate: 07.06.1973/08:00No.: 061.224To: Comrade Deputy Minister Nicolae GheneaWe would like to inform you on the main aspects of inter-Korean relations.North-South relations on the Korean Peninsula, as known to the wider public, are going through a process of increasing tension. The propaganda apparatus in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea resumed the labeling of South Korea, showing some restraint, as it should have according to the commitments it assumed through the 4 July Joint Communiqué, only towards the South Korean president.  Although there was no consensus on the basic positions of the two parties with respect to unification from the very beginning of the dialogue, currently there is a noticeable drifting apart between the point of view of the North and that of the South on crucial matters to the Korean nation.Although rational in themselves, the proposals of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea put forward within the Coordinating Committee as well as in the meetings of the Red Cross delegations, are, because of their radical character, unacceptable to the authorities in Seoul, especially given that they were put forward in a block, without giving the possibility to negotiate on them.At their turn, the South Korean authorities, mended after the difficulties they underwent in the international arena and after the measures they adopted in the fall of last year [1972] and aware of the political implications of the North’s proposals, are manifesting reduced receptivity towards the path imposed by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Our attention was grabbed by the fact that lately, the South Korean mass media are carrying out an intense publicity campaign around some alleged cases of infiltrations in the South of Northern agents and around the mass condemnation of those who participated in a spy network working for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The North Korean press systematically refutes, sometimes in an insufficiently persuasive manner, these reports. Externally, there is a sustained concern from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to establish diplomatic relations and to join organizations where South Korea is already present. To our mind, this approach is not meant to draw the two countries closer, but on the contrary, it is supposed to undermine and gradually weaken the positions of the authorities in Seoul. Starting from this rationale, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is currently carefully studying the attitude it shall take towards the forthcoming session of the United Nations, especially since, recently, Seoul decided to register this matter on the agenda, going against its old position in favor of postponing a discussion of the Korean matter.Depending on the position it will take, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will or will not use the right it has owing to its membership in the World Health Organization to appoint an observer to the UN.Against this background, there will be another reunion of co-presidents of the South-North Coordinating Committee on 9 June.

There is an increase in the number of declarations pointing that a future dismantling of the U.N. troops’ headquarters in South Korea will not influence the presence of US troops in the Korean Peninsula.In various ways, guarantees are being required from the Americans that “in the present situation a withdrawal of foreign troops from South Korea is not in question and impossible”. South Koreans are intensely “assisting” South Vietnamese refugees, by providing them with food, medicine and transportation means for their evacuation from dangerous areas.At the same time, with the intensification of anti-communist propaganda and the increase to a maximum of the “Northern danger,” measures are being taken in South Korea for preventing any type of disorder. Thus, new restrictions, backed by last year’s decrees for exceptional situations, have been again set in place over the last days. An increase in the number of arrests, together with an intensified censorship of the opposition’s political activity is being registered.We note an increased activity of the union of progressive forces under the leadership of neo-democratic and unity parties, a coalition that we deem capable of successfully conducting activities against the current President Park Chung Hee. Nevertheless we note that presently in South Korea not even the opposition fosters anti-American feelings, which helps the authorities in Seoul and the US, which until now does not allow for the possibility to renounce the positions they occupied in the country.Signed: Dumitru Popa\n",

Everhart, the GDR Ambassador to Pyongyang,  Heo Dam, Vice-Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, pointed out that currently several countries, especially in Africa and Asia, show tendencies of weakening support for the position of the DPRK on the issue of the reunification of the country; those countries are [also] re-orienting themselves towards establishing and developing relations both with North and with South Korea, which would sooner or later lead to the recognition of two Koreas.At the same time, with respect to the visits made by Pak Seong-cheol and Gang Ryang-uk, as DPRK Vice-Presidents, and Zan Zun Ghi and Kong Jin-tae Deputy Prime Ministers of the Administrative Council, as special envoys of President Kim Il Sung, to various countries in Africa and Asia, the Korean official said that the aforementioned visits are aiming at explaining in more detail the position of the DPRK on the Korean question and at determining large-scale actions to support the reunification of Korea.We would like to add that [judging] from the documents released [by the two sides] regarding the visits of the special envoys of President Kim Il Sung to countries in Africa and Asia, we couldn’t draw a conclusion about the purpose they served.From the conversations between Romanian diplomats and other diplomats – Indian, Egyptian, Hungarian, East German, Czechoslovak, etc., it would ensue that the abovementioned visits seek to intensify relations between the DPRK and the countries in question, to strengthen economic cooperation (which is partially confirmed for those countries they visited in Asia), to determine a more  substantial support [from these countries] for the Korean question, to arrange high-level visits to and from the DPRK, to discuss certain matters regarding cooperation within the Non-Aligned Movement.Given that South Korea publicly announced that it is planning to put the Korean question (including the simultaneous or separate admission to the UN) on the agenda of the forthcoming session of the UN General Assembly, it can be assumed that the DPRK is preparing its own point of view on the aforementioned question and in this respect, it is consulting a series of countries, asking, at the same time, for their support.SignedDumitru Popa\n",

      "To: Comrade Vasile GligaDeputy Minister of Foreign AffairsOn 22 March I was received by Kim Yong-sun [Kim Yong Sun], Deputy Head of the International Department of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers’ Party. Kim Yong-sun expressed the satisfaction and gratitude of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers’ Party, [and] of Comrade Kim Il Sung, for the warmth and hospitality with which the delegation of the Korean Workers’ Party, led by Kim Dong-gyu [Kim Tong Gyu], was received, for the special attention which this delegation enjoyed from the leadership of the Romanian Communist Party, [and] from Comrade Nicolae Ceausescu.Afterwards, the Deputy Head of the International Department of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers’ Party handed me a brief on the second session of the North-South Coordinating Committee, which took place recently in Pyongyang.Besides the main topics approached at this session, which we pointed out in our telegram no. 61084, Kim Yong-sun also informed us [about the following matters]:In the four-month interval between the first and second session of the North-South Coordinating Committee, there were contacts between North and South, but these contacts did not help diffuse the state of confrontation [between the two parties] and to ease the tension which has been accumulating.In these circumstances, the party leadership, comrade Kim Il Sung, after analyzing the situation, decided to steer the dialogue with the South towards practical measures, meant to eliminate the military confrontation between the two sides which is the primary condition for creating a climate of tension. [This decision] took shape in the well-known 5-point proposal, which was put forward by the North-Korean co-president of the committee (see our telegram no. 61084).It was highlighted that this line is not only the most righteous and rational [approach] to [engage] in a dialogue with South Korea, but also “a test for the loyalty of the South Korean puppets toward the cause of unification.”Kim Yong-sun showed that the negative reaction of the South [Korean] delegation toward the proposals of the North is circumscribed within the policy of the South Korean puppets to perpetuate the military confrontation and to achieve the unification of the country by means of “defeating communism,” [and] to participate to the dialogue strictly formally. He offered an overview of the situation in South Korea, referring to the intensification of war preparations and the psychosis against the DPRK, and he also underlined that this would trigger corresponding countermeasures from the North.The Deputy Head of the International Section said that the South [Korean] delegation would have blamed the North for inciting the “Revolutionary Party for Unification” in South Korea to violent revolution. He did not mention a thing, however, about the incident which occurred in a conversation between the two co-presidents [of the Committee] when in response to Lee Hu-rak’s assertion that the North started the war in June 1950, Pak Seong-cheol [Pak Song Chol] only said “what happened is in the past,” a statement recorded on tape and repeatedly played on South Korean radio.According to the brief [I received], the participants to the session discussed some technical problems, regarding the improvement of the permanent liaison apparatus in the Coordinating Committee, as well as regarding the publicity made about this session, but due to the obtuse attitude of the South Korean representatives, no further steps were made.Kim Yong-sun stressed that although no progress was made with respect to a drawing closer of the two sides’ points of view, the North scored a victory by having the following conclusions confirmed: the righteousness of [their] position to eliminate the state of military confrontation, the North’s dynamic and active affirmation in its interaction with the South at the international level, the exposure of the South [Korean] puppets’ policies, which under the guise of dialogue, are promoting confrontation and preparing for a new war, the reconfirmation of the idea that the North-South dialogue is a “fierce class struggle between revolution and counter-revolution, between patriotism and betrayal, between socialism and capitalism, a tough and complex struggle whose issues cannot be solved just through a few sessions, who is compelling [us] to strike the enemy whenever it is necessary.”Kim Yong-sun remarked that in the future, the [North] Korean party and government would militate for the promotion of dialogue, exposing the duplicitous tactics of the South. In conclusion, he expressed his hope that the Romanian Communist Party and the Romanian government would continue to grant the DPRK their support to the cause of the unification of Korea, exposing and isolating the South Korean puppet clique.The whole brief was formulated using very harsh words with respect to the Seoul authorities.With respect to our analysis of the significance and underpinnings of the new line promoted by the North in its confrontation with the South, we maintain the position we outlined in telegram no. 61.084.Signed: Dumitru Popa\n",

      "수신: Vasile Gliga 동지외무부 부상3월 22일, 조선로동당 중앙위원회 국제부 부부장 김용선이 나를 맞았다. 김용선은 전번 김동규가 이끈 조선로동당 대표단에 대한 따뜻한 대접과 호의, 그리고 루마니아 공산당 지도층과 니콜라에 차우셰스쿠 동지가 그들에게 보여준 특별한 관심에 조선로동당 중앙위원회, [그리고] 김일성 동지의 만족감과 감사를 전달하였다.이후, 조선로동당 중앙위원회 국제부 부부장은 최근 평양에서 열린 남북조절위원회의 두 번째 회담에 대해 간단히 보고했다.우리 전문 제61.084호에서 언급한 것과 같이 회담에서 다루어진 주제 이외에도 김용선은 우리에게 [다음의 문제를] 보고했다:남북조절위원회 1차 회담과 2차 회담 사이 넉 달의 기간 동안, 북과 남 사이에 접촉은 있었으나 이러한 접촉은 [두 단체 사이의] 대립관계의 해소 또는 점차 고조되는 긴장을 완화하지 못했다.이러한 조건하에서 당의 지도층 김일성 동지는 상황을 분석한 후 남과의 대화를 실용적인 방향으로 지휘하여 긴장 분위기 조성의 가장 근본적인 원인이 되는 군사대립을 제거하고자 했다. [이 결정은] 위원회 북측 공동위원장이 제안한 바 있는 소위 5도 제안(전문 제61084호 참조)에 보여진 것이다.이것은 남조선과의 대화를 위해 가장 적합하고 이성적인 [접근법]일 뿐만 아니라 또한 “통일을 위한 남조선 괴뢰들의 충성도 시험”이다.김용선은 북측의 제안에 대한 남조선 대표단의 부정적 반응이 매우 형식적으로 대화에 참여하는 양상과 “공산주의를 타도”하여 국가 통일을 이루고 군사적 대립을 영구화하고자 하는 남조선 괴뢰들의 정책에 나타남을 보여주었다그는 남조선의 상황에 대해 일반적인 설명을 제공하며 전쟁준비 및 북조선에 대한 강박증 심화에 대해 언급하고 이것이 북측으로 하여금 대책마련을 야기했음을 강조하였다.국제부 부부장은 남조선 대표단이 남조선에서 “통일혁명당”을 부추겨 폭력적인 혁명이 발생한 것에 대해 북측을 비난했을 것이라고 말했다. 그러나 그는 1950년 6월 북한이 전쟁을 야기했다는 이후락의 주장에 박성철이 “지나간 일은 과거일 뿐이다”라고 일축한 [위원회의] 두 공동위원장 간 대화 사건에 대해서는 일체 언급하지 않았다. 박성철의 발언은 녹음되어 남조선의 라디오 방송에서 반복하여 송출된 바 있다.나에게 한 보고에 따르면 회담에서 참여자들은 조절위원회의 영구 담당조직 개선과 회담의 내용 공개 관련 등, 몇 가지의 기술적인 문제들을 논의했으나 남조선 대표단의 미적지근한 태도로 인해 추가적인 진척은 없었다.김용선은 양 측의 관점을 가까이 하는 데에는 진척이 없었지만, 북측은 다음의 결론을 확인함으로 승리했다고 강조했다: [이는 즉] 군사대립 상황 제거를 위한 그들의 정당성 확인, 국제 수준에서 남측과의 상호작용에 있어 북측의 역동적이고 적극적인 태도 확인, 대화의 핑계를 틈타 대립을 격화하고 새로운 전쟁을 준비하는 남조선 괴뢰정책의 폭로, 북-남 대화가 “호시탐탐 적을 치고자 하는 자들과의 혁명과 반혁명, 애국자와 반역자, 사회주의와 자본주의 사이의 격렬한 계급 투쟁이며 몇 차례의 회담으로는 쉽게 풀 수 없는 격하고 복잡한 투쟁”임을 재확인[한 것이었다].김용선은 미래에는 북조선의 당과 정부가 대화 추진을 위해 움직여 남측의 이중적인 전략을 폭로하겠다고 말했다. 결론적으로 그는 조선 통일과 남조선 괴뢰 세력 고립을 위해 루마니아 공산당과 루마니아 정부가 조선민주주의인민공화국에 계속적인 지원 제공을 희망한다고 언급하였다.이 보고에는 서울 정부에 대해 매우 격한 표현이 계속되어 사용되었다. 남측과의 갈등과 관련된 북조선의 새로운 정책노선의 중요성과 기본내용과 관련해 우리는 전문 제61.084호에 언급된 입장을 고수하고 있다. 서명: Dumitru Popa\n",

      "TELEGRAMSender: PyongyangCLASSIFICATION: SECRETDate: 25.03.1975No.: 059.101The recent tenth meeting of the Vice-Presidents of the South-North Coordinating Committee, on which the head of the Liaison Division in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea Ministry of Foreign Affairs individually informed the Romanian Ambassador and other heads of diplomatic missions, confirms our conclusion that the inter-Korean dialogue continues to stall, being practically limited to an organized exchange of accusations and labels.In spite of the seemingly new proposals made by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea at the tenth meeting of the South-North Coordinating Committee, these are premeditatedly inoperable, tacking fundamental claims which could be solved only if the two parties gradually drew closer to one another and reached an understanding (regarding the cessation of the hostile South Korean campaign against the North, the cancellation of anti-communist measures in South Korea, etc.)The recent discovery of another two tunnels connecting the North with the South, for which the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is blamed but which North Korea refuses to admit to, dug at great depth under the DMZ and allowing for the instantaneous launch of important [armed] forces [into South Korea], aggravated the crisis in inter-Korean relations even more, which was the main topic tackled by the Vice-President from South Korea at the most recent meeting.In the current circumstances, it is impossible to mitigate the tensions on the Peninsula, as long as the two sides are drifting away from the political path of achieving the unification [of the country], and as long as the primordial role of the entire Korean nation in fulfilling this desideratum is ignored.Signed: Dumitru Popa\n",

      "To: Comrade Vasile GligaDeputy Minister of Foreign AffairsDuring a formal visit I paid to Pak Seong-cheol [Pak Song Chol], member of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers’ Party, Vice-Premier of the Administrative Council, he offered an overview of the main current aspects of inter-Korean relations and the future orientation of the Korean Workers’ Party in this respect. After insistently stressing on the unity of the Korean state and nation, Pak Seong-cheol said that “the Korean Workers’ Party will not allow for the perpetual dismantlement of the country, [which is] divided not through the will of the Korean people but due to external forces, [due to] American imperialists.” He said that the Korean Workers’ Party is promoting the peaceful reunification of the country, but “the DPRK will not remain inactive if the masses in the South will rise up and ask for help from the North.”In its dialogue with the South, the DPRK is currently undertaking a firm line, dealing with basic principles of inter-Korean relations: eliminating the state of military confrontation, scaling down the arms race, pulling out foreign armed forces, signing a peace treaty, [all of which] go against the position of the South Koreans to solve the problem gradually and partially.The refusal of the Seoul authorities to get involved in concrete and substantial matters regarding the rapprochement between North and South evidence the duplicitous tactics of the South Koreans, [which involves] a continuation of dialogue on the one hand and preparation for war on the other hand.At its turn, the DPRK feels compelled to do the same thing, taking all preparatory measures to retaliate accordingly to any provocation.In the current circumstances, when the DPRK is ranked number 1 in the world in terms of armed forces per capita and when it is being discussed to modernize them, it is necessary to sustain some important material efforts.At the same time, the intensification of the North-South dialogue and the inclusion of an increasing number of people in this process call for measures to improve the standard of living, so that the superiority of the socialist order can be proven through facts.This task compelled the DPRK to ask for help from abroad. In this respect, the Romanian party and state leadership allotted, with the help of former Vice-Premier Jeong Jun-taek [Jong Jun Thaek], a significant [portion] of aid, for which the Korean Workers’ Party is deeply grateful.With respect to bilateral relations, Pak Seong-cheol offered a very positive appraisal on their evolution in the interval following the visit to the DPRK of Comrade Nicolae Ceausescu and he underlined that Comrade Kim Il Sung repeatedly assigned to the Korean party and state cadres, the task to militate incessantly for the consolidation and development of collaboration with Romania.Talking about the recent visit to Romania of the delegation led by Kim Dong-gyu [Kim Tong Gyu], the Vice-Premier said that “Comrade Kim Il Sung was very happy with the honest, [and friendly] atmosphere in which the discussion with Comrade Nicolae Ceausescu [took place].” He said that the head of the Korean delegation presented a report before the Political Committee on matters related to his trip in Europe and that the results of his visit to Romania enjoyed the high appreciation of the party leadership.A summary of the main comments made at various levels of the North Korean party and government with respect to the party leadership’s visit to Romania and especially with respect to the meeting between Comrade Nicolae Ceausescu and Kim Dong-gyu makes us think that Comrade Kim Il Sung understood the meaning of the message sent by the Secretary General of the Romanian Communist Party, taking note of the value of the ideas suggested on this occasion.Signed: Dumitru Popa\n",

      "수신: Vasile Gliga 동지외무부 부상조선로동당 중앙위원회 위원이자 행정위원회 부상인 박성철을 공식적으로 방문시, 그는 나에게 북남관계의 주요 현안과 이에 따른 조선로동당의 추후 지향을 설명하였다.조선 통일에 대해 계속하여 강조한 다음 박성철은 “조선로동당은 조선인들의 의지가 아닌 외부세력, 즉 미 제국주의자들로 [인해] 국가가 분단되어 있는 이 국가의 지속적인 해체를 허락하지 않을 것”이라고 말했다. 그의 말에 따르면 조선로동당은 국가의 평화로운 통일을 추구하고 있지만 “남쪽의 대중이 봉기하며 북측에 지원을 요청하는 경우에는 조선민주주의인민공화국이 이를 가만 두고 보지만은 않을 것”이라고 했다.남측과의 대화에서 조선민주주의인민공화국은 북남관계의 기본원칙 선정에 대해 현재 강경노선을 취하고 있다: [이는 즉] 군사대립을 제거하고, 군비경쟁을 축소하며, 무장 외세를 퇴각시키고, 평화조약을 체결하는 것인데, [이 모든 것이] 점진적이고 부분적으로 문제를 해결하고자 하는 남조선인의 입장과 대립된다.북과 남의 관계회복과 관련된 구체적이고 물질적 문제 논의를 회피하는 서울 관료들의 행태는 남조선인의 이중적 책략을 드러내고 있다. 이는 한편으로는 대화를 유지하며 다른 편으로는 전쟁을 준비하는 것이다. 조선민주주의인민공화국 어쩔 수 없이 똑같은 행동을 취하여 어떤 도발의 경우에도 대응할 수 있는 준비를 갖추어야 할 것 같은 생각을 하고 있다.현재 조선민주주의인민공화국은 인구당 군력에서 세계 1위를 차지하고 있으며 그들을 현대화하고자 하면 어느 정도 상당한 물질적 노력[투입]이 필수적이다.동시에 북남 대화의 심화와 이 과정에 참여하는 사람들의 숫자 증가는 삶의 질 개선 요구를 가지고 와, 사회주의 질서의 우월성은 사실로 드러날 것이다. 이러한 과제는 조선민주주의인민공화국으로 하여금 외국에 지원을 요청하도록 했다. 이에 따라, 루마니아 당과 정부 지도층은 전 부상 정준택의 도움을 받아 상당한 양의 원조를 제공하였으며, 조선로동당은 이를 매우 감사히 여기고 있다.양자관계에 대하여 박성철은 니콜라에 차우셰스쿠 동지의 조선민주주의인민공화국 방문 후 매우 긍정적인 발전이 있었다고 이야기 했으며, 또한 김일성 동지가 조선의 당과 정부 간부들에게 루마니아와의 협력 개발과 강화를 위해 계속하여 노력할 것을 주문했음을 강조했다.김동규 대표단의 루마니아 방문에 대하여 부상은 “니콜라에 차우셰스쿠 동지와의 대화가 이루어진 진솔[하고 친근]한 대화 분위기에 대해 김일성 동지가 매우 기뻐했다”고 이야기 했다. 그는 조선대표단 수장이 유럽여정과 루마니아 방문에 대해 정무위원회에 보고한 내용은 당 지도층의 높은 칭송을 받았다고 말했다.당 지도층의 루마니아 방문과 특히 니콜라에 차우셰스쿠 동지와 김동규의 회담에 대해 북조선 당과 정부 각 계층이 언급한 내용의 요약을 보면 김일성 동지가 이번 제안들의 가치를 중시하며 루마니아 공산당 총비서가 보낸 메시지의 의미를 이해한 것이라고 여겨진다.서명: Dumitru Popa\n",

The ROK is to receive all equipment and armament from the withdrawn troops; the plan for modernizing the South Korean army will be revised.   Concurrently, safety measures for the prevention or elimination of a potential conflict in the Korean Peninsula will be discussed. In addition to promises made by the US that American troops stationed in Japan will intervene in Korea in case of emergency, envoys from Seoul want to receive guarantees from Japan that it will contribute its land, naval, and air forces, when necessary, in order to maintain security on the Peninsula. South Korean comments on the matter suggest a tendency on the ROK’s behalf to delay and ultimately extend the withdrawal deadline of American troops. Radio stations in Seoul repeatedly note that Japan, the PRC, and the USSR, in the interest of maintaining peace in the region, disagree with a total and unwarranted US troop withdrawal from South Korea. Hitherto, Pyongyang has not commented on the meeting in Seoul on May 24. Signed: D. Popa\n",

Poland, emphasized Glinski, would like to support its Korean counterpart in overcoming these difficulties and suggested that, apart from developing bilateral economic relations, the DPRK should consider adhering to the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance.

      "To the First Division, MFA Between 8 and 13 October, several gatherings organized as military training comprising all military corps took place in Pyongyang and reunited all the commanders and political instructors from the Korean People’s Army. At the end, with the participation of Comrade Kim Il Sung and other cadres from the high echelons of the DPRK party and state leadership a general gathering took place, with more than 20,000 participants, where O Jin-u [O Jin U], the chief of the Army staff presented a report on the state of political and military readiness in the current circumstances, discussing the immediate responsibilities of the Army. The General Secretary of the Korean Workers’ Party also spoke at this meeting.The briefs released to the press after the event indicate that the speakers unanimously underlined the necessity to continuously strengthen the political-revolutionary activity, to increase the level of technical and combat preparedness of the army.Special emphasis was put on the learning of modern combat techniques by the entire army, on “the transformation of the entire army into an army of military cadres.”After a prolonged absence, the idea that “under the leadership of Comrade Kim Il Sung, during our lifetime, we must chase away the American imperialists and achieve the reunification of the country” reemerged. The news discussing this gathering underlines that all speakers underscored their indignation that “the American imperialists and their fascist puppets in South Korea, under the guise of wanting to continue the dialogue, are preparing another war against the North.”From Aurelian Lazar’s discussions with A. Putinet and I. Taraba, the charges d’affaires ad interim from the USSR and from Hungary, respectively, it could be gathered that this gathering of military cadres was necessary because certain fiery elements within the ranks of the DPRK army appeared, who treated the situation in South Korea and the existing international circumstances superficially, and therefore believed that the current conditions were favorable to forcibly reuniting the country.Our sources tell us that this issue was the object of ample debates at the recent plenum of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers’ Party in September, where only through the energetic intervention of Comrade Kim Il Sung the force of this current of thought could be countered, which made it possible to continue on the same rational line of solving the Korean problem through peaceful political means. We will follow the events closely and inform you on the commentaries made about this gathering accordingly.Signed: Dumitru Popa\n",

      "To the First Directorate - RelationsFollowing a discussion between Aurelian Lazar and I.N. Dudoladov, Soviet first secretary, we noted that the USSR is unpleased with the current state of its relations with the DPRK, given that currently Korean-Soviet relations are in a state of stalemate, that exchanges of delegations have been reduced to an all-time low and that the lack of initiative from the North Korean side has been complemented with a passive attitude regarding Soviet initiatives.I.N. Dudoladov mentioned that his country’s relations with the DPRK had passed through such critical moments before, but contrary to past experiences, when Soviet diplomats were worried and alarmed about the respective circumstances, they were adopting a much more indifferent attitude, which, according to the Soviet diplomat, had overarching and rapid effects on the [Korean] hosts.Dudoladov said that compared to the reserved attitude the DPRK is adopting towards the USSR, the USSR come forward with proposals to support the DPRK on the international arena, taking such actions that the DPRK reconsiders its position towards the USSR on its own.The Soviet diplomat mentioned that this state of bilateral relations between the USSR and the DPRK would last for at least another year, at which point they will gain the intensity which characterized them in the past years. He added that relations between the DPRK and the PRC follow the same tenuous path [as relations between the DPRK and the USSR] except that good relations between the DPRK and the PRC correspond to cold relations between the DPRK and the USSR, and vice-versa.I.N. Dudoladov pointed out that although it was less than one week until the anniversary of the USSR October Socialist Revolution, the Koreans have not informed the USSR embassy about the ceremonies meant to celebrate that day in the DPRK, which means that this year’s attention to November 7th would be insignificant.

      "TELEGRAM 066718To: the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to comrade Constantin Oancea and Ion CiubotaruFrom: the Romanian Embassy in PyongyangSubject: Regarding President Tito’s official visit to the DPRKDate: September 4, 1977Classification: SecretI. The [North] Korean party and state leadership paid exceptional attention to preparations for President Tito’s official visit to the DPRK. In terms of the number of participants, decorations, the pompous presentation of the visited sites, and inhabitants–costumes, dancing, singing, flowers–it can be said that it has been an unprecedented reception in the DPRK. Sources from the Yugoslav Embassy in Pyongyang informed us that an organization committee led by Kim Il Sung himself had been established in view of the preparations for the visit. Numerous efforts have been undertaken so that Pyongyang appears as festive as possible–billboards, flower garlands, flags, illuminated slogans, refurbishment, etc. Approximately two weeks in advance, Korean party organizations discussed Yugoslavia, its internal and foreign policies, and President Tito’s personality. Also unprecedented has been the number of participants–approximately 300,000 people at the reception, around 100,000 people at the organized meeting, and around 50,000 people at the artistic and sports event. The exceptional efforts undertaken by the Korean leadership ensured the utmost success of the visit; it is estimated that a new record has been set in Pyongyang in the last 5 years. According to sources from the Yugoslav Embassy, President Tito mentioned that, among all the 50 countries he has visited thus far, ‘the visit to the DPRK exceeded all expectations.’ II. Referring to discussions between President Josip Broz Tito and President Kim Il Sung on September 2nd, within a working meeting with Ambassador Dumitru Popa and Victor Nanu, Yugoslav Ambassador to Pyongyang Tode Vardjinsky recounts the following:  During one of their first meetings, President Tito told President Kim Il Sung about his visit to the USSR. Among others, he noted that a series of issues regarding international communism and the workers’ movement have been discussed, including Eurocommunism and communist parties’ autonomy worldwide. Tito told L. I. Brezhnev that he does not want to defend Santiago Carrillo because of his various mistakes, but acknowledges that Carrillo is right in adopting an independent policy for the Spanish Communist Party given the specific conditions in Spain. The independent, autonomous activity of the Spanish Communist Party constitutes a mobilizing factor for the masses and for all progressive movements in Spain.Acting otherwise means encouraging reactionary forces in their fight against communism.Tito and Kim Il Sung concurred that there is no such thing as a European, African or Asian communism, but only historical and socio-economical differences between countries. The Yugoslav President further noted that there is no need for a leader or a center of the communist movement. As such, emphasized Tito, the SFRY sought to include in the final act of the 1976 Conference of Communist and Workers Parties of Europe in Berlin a provision for respecting the autonomy of each party. The incident with Santiago Carrillo is an infringement of the final act of the Berlin Conference. Tito noted that the Soviets had made a big mistake in publishing the article against the Spanish Communist Party in Novoye Vremya. Although Brezhnev admitted to this mistake, he further mentioned that Carrillo was also wrong to publish a well-known anti-Soviet book. Novoye Vremya was compelled to counter respond and, as such, it became a dispute among journalists. Referring to the situation in Africa, Tito mentioned that reactionary forces in the US, Latin America, Europe, England, France and the FGR are actively seeking to mobilize in order to overthrow progressive regimes in countries such as Libya, Angola, Zambia, Tanzania, and to defeat democratic and progressive movements throughout Africa. Reactionary forces are very well organized, having calculated strategies. Hostile reactions from certain countries, including some from the Non-Aligned Movement such as Egypt, Morocco, Zaire, are highly threatening both peace within the region and the unity of the Non-Aligned Movement. US retaliatory forces together with reactionary movements in Africa have orchestrated and managed to overthrow some progressive regimes. According to Tito, given the situation, it is our obligation to encourage and support all anti-imperialist and progressive movements throughout the world. Kim Il Sung fully agreed, further proposing to maintain a direct and permanent contact with all the states in order to explain the current global situation and to mobilize all the Non-Aligned countries so as to defend and strengthen the solidity of the movement.The Yugoslav Ambassador noted that when Tito inquired about Kim Il Sung’s opinion on the People’s Republic of China, the Korean head of state avoided a direct answer, simply responding ‘You will go there and you will see.’ Referring to the situation in Asia, President Kim Il Sung mentioned that the Socialist Republics of Vietnam, Laos and Kampuchea have become free countries, but suffer from a series of unsolved territorial and national issues, which reactionary forces are taking advantage of. A military conflict in Indochina is possible. Kim Il Sung recommended Tito to visit Kampuchea, Laos and Vietnam in order to discuss and resolve the major issues within these countries without external influence (Soviet and Chinese). Tito responded that he can make some suggestions without assuming a mediatory role. Discussing the Korean issue, Kim Il Sung noted that the DPRK is willing to liaise with the US in order to discuss the problem on a general level, not in detail. The DPRK primarily wishes for American troop withdrawal from South Korea, guaranteeing it will not attack South Korea. For the time being, the US administration does not wish to negotiate with the DPRK in the absence of South Korean delegates. Answering Tito’s question, Kim Il Sung noted that the DPRK does not wish to discuss the Korean issue with Japan, the USSR and China. Acknowledging both North and South Korea’s interests in the matter, as well as the role of the United States, the DPRK is willing to discuss the Korean issue and negotiate with American and South Korean envoys, but not with representatives of the fascist leadership in Seoul until it has been replaced with a democratic government. Regarding the Non-Aligned Movement, President Tito emphasized the need to strengthen the movement and adopt more flexible membership criteria. It is important to be aware of more unusual situations; why should countries like Romania or Sweden not enjoy full membership within the Non-Aligned Movement? The Yugoslav Ambassador to Pyongyang recounted that prior to his visit to the USSR, President Tito received a letter from President Jimmy Carter, showing interest in the following visits to the USSR and China, and proposing that Tito discuss the real situation in Europe and the situation in Asia with Soviet leaders and Kim Il Sung, respectively.

We inform that the diplomatic corps in Pyongyang – East German, Hungarian, Polish, and Czechoslovak diplomats – have commented, during discussions with Romanian diplomats, on the possibility that Heo Dam’s visit may, among others, aim to counter the intense activity of the South Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs, who has been in New York for several days. Many diplomats have particularly noticed the commentary of a Japanese radio station, according to which Heo Dam is the first Korean Premier to receive an entry visa to the US. It is assumed that such a gesture on behalf of US authorities represents a change in the American position towards the DPRK. Our Embassy believes there is no conclusive evidence of this alleged change. Signed: D. Popa\n",

      "Ionescu Teofil had a conversation with the Chinese counselor, Gan Den [sic], from which we took note of the following matters:When asked by the Romanian diplomat about the rationale behind the current mass media campaign focused on the ‘great revolutionary event’ and on the statements regarding the peril of another war on the Korean Peninsula, the Chinese diplomat answered that all these did not reflect a real and objective situation. Given the existing international circumstances and given the foreign policy line adopted by the DPRK, it can be said that there is no danger of a war for the DPRK. As long as the DPRK joins the forces of those who are hostile towards China, it has no reasons to fear an American aggression or an intervention from the South Korean puppets. (original emphasis) The Americans and the South Koreans are grateful for the current orientation of the North Korean leadership and will do whatever it takes to encourage it. Therefore, they will not undertake any serious action which may improve Sino-North Korean relations. It is very clear to the Americans and the South Koreans that in case a military conflict erupts on 38th parallel, Chinese troops would have to intervene.On the other side, in the given circumstances, the DPRK will not dare to undertake any serious action along the lines depicted in the North Korean mass media. Having bad relations with China and excellent relations with the USSR represents a disincentive for taking action in the direction of reunifying the country or expelling the Americans from South Korea.The Chinese diplomat said that whoever knew the North Koreans, was aware that one should not to listen to what they said in public but pay attention to what they did in practice. History proved that the North Koreans said one thing in public and had or did a totally different thing in practice. Therefore, it can be concluded that by stirring things up with propaganda around ‘the great event,’ ‘the danger of American aggression,’ the North Koreans have other objectives in mind, such as:- Masking their lack of revolutionary spirit;- Compelling socialist countries in Europe, above all the USSR, to grant the DPRK material and financial assistance, and having a sound justification for asking for this sort of assistance;- Drawing the attention of the masses away from serious problems, for example: the economic situation of the country; the material situation of the population; the failure of the 7-year plan; renouncing to self-reliance; and directing the attention of the masses to military matters, the peril of a war, since the leadership is certain that a war is not likely and that the Americans and the South Koreans will not pay attention to North Korean propaganda, knowing what lies behind it.In case this propaganda is backed up by actions directed at the normalization of relations with China, then the basis for DPRK’s position would be concrete. However, at the time being, the North Koreans are working hard at worsening relations with China and at persuading public opinion to follow suit. Concomitantly, they are doing their best to cultivate hostile sentiments toward China among the North Korean population, to convince it by means of gross fabrications, that the Chinese people is its enemy, that China is meddling in the internal affairs of the DPRK, that it seeks to economically strangle the DPRK. The North Korean leadership are asking and receiving from China wheat (200,000 tons), soy beans for oil (60,000 tons), coke coal, crude. In spite of all these, they are misinforming the population about how China is not delivering the aforementioned goods, how it does not respect its treaty obligations, all these in order to starve off the population and economically strangle the DPRK.The Chinese counselor said that the more the DPRK leadership lied, the more aid China would send to North Korea, so as to put the North Koreans in a position where they would have to lie even more and thus expose themselves. For the current year, the PRC would increase its deliveries of wheat, soy beans for cooking oil, coke coal and petroleum products to the DPRK. (From the information we currently have, during their trip to Moscow, both Kim Il Sung and Kim Il asked the Soviets to increase their deliveries of petroleum products, wheat, cooking oil, coke coal, so as to fill in the gaps created by China’s refusal to deliver these goods.)When asked about the echo of these actions within the masses, the Chinese diplomat answered that he did not know anything about that topic. Subsequently he said that the two peoples were linked by an old friendship, which would eventually help truth prevail.The North Korean people, he added, knew that China represented the guarantee of the very existence of the DPRK and that the Chinese people had helped and always would help the North Korean people, in any given circumstances.Signed: N.

      "On April 7, I was summoned by Jeong Jun-taek [Jong Jun Thaek], the vice-president of the Cabinet of the DPRK, the president of the State Planning Committee for atomic energy, who asked me to send a letter to the president of the Romanian Council for Atomic Energy, Horia Hulubei, in which the North Korean government expressed its will to expand technical and scientific cooperation between the two countries in the field of atomic energy. In this respect, Jeong Jun-taek pointed out that the DPRK planned to send a 7-person technical-scientific delegation working on nuclear energy to Romania in the second and third term of this year, for approximately 10 days. The aim of this trip would be for the Korean delegation to become acquainted with the successes and the experience accumulated in Romania from the research carried out on atomic energy, with a particular interest in Romania’s experience with research in the areas of technology and physics, nuclear reactors, introduction of radioactive isotopes and radiations in the national economy, and with a particular interest in the Romania’s research successes on nuclear fuel and materials. The North Koreans wish to visit research institutes and industrial units using radioactive isotopes.The President of the North Korean Committee for Atomic Energy mentioned that such a request had been already brought to the attention of their counterpart in Romania on the occasion of the talks between the North Korean vice-president and Prof. Titeica, at their meeting in January 1967 at Dubna. The North Koreans expressed their desire to receive a response from the Romanians, together with the period most convenient for the Romanian counterpart and a preliminary work agenda.We would like to inform you that similar requests have been sent to other socialist countries in Europe. The Polish Ambassador has already given his country’s approval with respect to the requests made by the DPRK.We recommend that you analyze with goodwill the extant opportunities, with a view to accepting the visit of the North Korean technical-scientific delegation.We shall send the letter through currier.Signed: N.

      "On April 12, in a discussion with M. Golub, the Czechoslovak Ambassador to Pyongyang, he referred to the following issues regarding the internal situation in the DPRK and the incidents on the 38th parallel: he possesses information from the Czechoslovak delegates in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission that the North Koreans are responsible for the majority of the provocations on the 38th parallel, and very few by the Americans. The North Koreans are provoking these incidents so as to keep the masses in a perpetual state of tensions, to justify the need for the full militarization of the entire country and to get the population accustomed to shortages, in case DPRK attacks South Korea and subsequently is confronted with considerable hardship, which the population could therefore bear with more easily.The North Korean leadership is aware that revolutionary forces in South Korea are almost inexistent and that is why it tries to use all means available to send activist groups to the South to organize the progressive forces there. It is possible, the Czechoslovak diplomat added, that the situation worsens in the upcoming months, because of the upcoming presidential elections in South Korea scheduled for May 3rd, until when the North Koreans will try to send groups to the South to sabotage them. It is not unthinkable for the North Koreans to unpleasantly surprise all those labor union delegations gathered in Pyongyang for May 1st celebrations , by attempting to carry out a larger operation, and then put the blame on the Americans. The goal of this operation would be to impress foreign delegations and demonstrate the justified need for liberating the South, as well as secure their assistance.Lately, the Czechoslovak diplomat added, the US had changed its attitude within the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, growing increasingly aggressive and brutal, and shouting in the North Koreans’ faces that they are the inciters and the criminals, that in the current circumstances, the North Koreans can no longer invoke the provisions of many articles in the armistice agreement. It seems, said the Czechoslovak Ambassador, that the recent defection of the Deputy Director of the North Korean News Agency helped the US and the South Koreans understand the intentions of the North, the reasons for their military preparations and the details of the state of DPRK armed forces and their military equipment, etc.We want to add that on April 10, two more North Korean groups attempted to cross the 38th parallel and infiltrate the South (emphasis in original). The two groups of North Koreans made a 1-km long incursion past the frontier.  Four members of these groups got killed. Newspapers and radio channels in North Korea have not mentioned anything about these incidents and the four deaths.Lately, there are more and more workers’ guards receiving military training in Pyongyang. Over the past week, these guards received new equipment: new rifles, automatic weapons, shotguns, and light anti-tank equipment. The press is publishing more and more articles mentioning how troops are waiting a mere sign from Kim Il Sung to cross the 38th parallel and liberate the south of the country through arms.It is hard to predict what these tensions will lead to and how these incidents will evolve, in terms of frequency and magnitude. Many diplomats believe that if these tensions increase in frequency and intensity, it is possible that they degenerate in an armed conflict.We will continue following these events and keep you informed.Signed: N.

      "The Czech First Secretary told T. Ionescu that the North Koreans are precluding the Czechoslovak and Polish delegations in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to undertake any concrete actions regarding the investigation and inspection on the premises of incidents and infringements of the armistice agreement (emphasis in original). Instead the North Koreans insist, sometimes in a quite untactful manner, for its point of view of the incidents to be assumed as the only true version.Because of this, it is very hard to know the reasons and real causes of these incidents, who and to what extent is to blame for them. Judging by the attitude adopted by the North Koreans, they do not wish for the truth to be known and they are trying to create such circumstances that when incidents and clashes do occur, they can be blamed on the enemy.The approach of the North Koreans towards the Czechoslovak and Polish delegations puts the military envoys from the two countries in a delicate position. They are mocked by their Swedish and Swiss counterparts, for whom the South Koreans are creating the proper conditions and are facilitating normal working routines.On the other hand, in some meetings of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, the American-South Korean camp accuse the North Koreans of plotting to undermine the armistice and of carrying the blame for the current incidents on the 38th parallel, using as evidence the fact that the North Koreans are not allowing the Czechoslovak and Polish delegations to investigate the incursions in South Korea, to express their own points of view on those who are responsible for this state of affairs.The Czech diplomat expressed his belief that the current state of serious tension on both sides of the 38th parallel could easily get out of control and degenerate. Judging by the frequency and magnitude of these incidents, it can be concluded that we are witnessing a continuing increase of the number and scale of these incidents. He pointed out that one of the main causes for these incidents was the North Korean practice to send groups of agitators to the South, past the 38th parallel. The crossing of these groups is usually covered by military troops, which often accompany them to the DMZ. The crossing of such a group resulted in the April 5 incident, in which five people died. The North Korean group was intercepted as soon as it crossed the border and when the Americans and the South Koreans opened fire on them, the North Koreans had time to withdraw, leaving no material evidence on South Korean territory. Because of this, the incident was widely speculated on in the North.However, the interlocutor went on, the Americans learned the right lessons from these events and they no longer allowed them to enter South Korean territory and then shoot them, so as to obtain the necessary material evidence. In these cases, the North Korean authorities are not mentioning them at all. For example, the Czech diplomat pointed out that four days ago two such incidents occurred, as two North Korean groups tried to cross the frontier and enter the South, resulting in the death of six and respectively two North Korean militaries, and one of them, critically injured, was taken prisoner. Their bodies, together with other material evidence, were found 1 km south of the border. Although the South Koreans are extensively exploiting these events for propaganda purposes, in Pyongyang everything is kept secret.The Czech diplomat, talking about the failures of the North Koreans, mentioned that it was not unthinkable that these two incidents would lead up to larger-scale events and hasten the implementation of the extant plans of the North Koreans.Signed: N.

      "In a conversation with the Counselor of the DRV Embassy, Huang Mîoi, Ionescu Teofil brought up the issue of the increasing tensions on the 38th parallel, of the frequent armed clashes and especially of the decisive tone adopted by the North Korean press on these matters. Mentioning their previous discussion and given the fact that both in Pyongyang and elsewhere ‘the red guards’ and the civilian population were making intense military preparations, he asked whether all of these manifestations could not indicate that the North Koreans set out to put their plans into action.The Vietnamese Counselor-Minister replied that his belief, based on the information he had been given, was that there were no serious reasons to worry. The fact that the current state of tension is occurring in spring, before elections in South Korea and before the May 1st big-scale celebrations in North Korea, makes one think that both the South Koreans and the North Koreans have limited and immediate goals in mind.The Vietnamese diplomat remarked that these incidents and the state of tension on the 38th parallel had a concrete explanation, which indicated that they would soon subside in magnitude. In this respect, he mentioned that for many years the DPRK had been sending 30-40 people every year to the South, past the 38th parallel.They are sent there to maintain the network of spies up and running, to gather information on the internal, economic and military state of affairs, and to establish the premises for a guerilla movement in South Korea.Due to objective conditions in South Korea, these agents cannot stay there during winter - they cannot feed themselves, they cannot travel from one place to another and they cannot hide – they go back to the North in autumn. For these reasons, incidents increase numerically in spring and autumn.This year, given the upcoming elections in South Korea and Pyongyang’s future intentions, the DPRK increased the number of agents to 100. Therefore the number of groups infiltrated in the South increased and sparked more incidents. By the end of April, these crossings will end which lead to a decrease in the number of incidents. The Vietnamese diplomat expressed his belief that the South Koreans had good intelligence about these crossings of North Korean groups and managed to seal off the border, causing all these incidents but also inflicting a lot of damage on the North Koreans.In the given circumstances, each side exploits this situation for propagandistic purposes, to their own interests. In the South, this situation is used in the electoral campaign, stirring anticommunist sentiment and disarming the opposition. Moreover, by exploiting this situation, the South Koreans want to persuade the Americans to be more generous with their military and economic aid to South Korea.As the DPRK is trying to achieve several goals at the same time, the situation on the 38th parallel is grossly exaggerated and interwoven with an intense military preparation of the population, whose purpose is merely to celebrate May 1st when there will be ample parades of the Red Guards and of the self-defense battalions. According to the Vietnamese diplomat, the May 1st manifestations will be a show of force to convince foreign delegations of the seriousness of the situation on the Korean peninsula and of the readiness of the North Korean forces. The North Koreans’ manifestations for May 1st are aiming at making a very good impression on their guests, so as to mitigate the effects of the posters which appeared in Beijing on the internal situation in the DPRK.Overall, the Vietnamese diplomat added, by exaggerating these incidents on the 38th parallel and by creating a warmongering psychosis, the North Koreans wanted to put pressure on socialist countries, especially the USSR, to pay more attention to the DPRK, to answer Pyongyang’s requests for military, economic and political assistance more promptly.The North Koreans also want to temperate the Chinese, to whom the DPRK wants to prove that by siding with the USSR they did not give in to revisionists but on the contrary, they managed to impose their revolutionary fervor on the USSR. The North Koreans are making a lot of noise about liberating South Korea and about starting a war with the Americans, because they know that the Chinese really appreciate these ideas and in 1965 tried to push the North Koreans to do exactly that, but the Koreans refused, viewing this plan as adventurous. The Vietnamese diplomat believes that the North Koreans suddenly became revolutionary, after being criticized in the posters of the Chinese Red Guards.The idea of a war to liberate South Korea by fighting against the Americans brings about the possibility of an improvement in relations between the DPRK and the PRC.Note:The remarks of the Vietnamese diplomat on the current situation in the DPRK also correspond to the views of our official.Signed: N.

      "On August 2nd, in a conversation between A. Lazar and the Third Soviet Secretary, G. Chubotarenko, the Soviet diplomat pointed out the following issues:1. On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, the Soviet Union made more than ten invitations to various Korean delegations (youth, labor union, women, friendship association, military, twin cities, etc) to come to the Soviet Union to take part in the activities meant to mark the great event.It appeared, the Soviet diplomat said, that the Soviet Embassy had received assurances from the Korean leadership that all delegations which the Soviet invited would give a positive response soon. Our ambassador will send an invitation to the Workers’ Party of Korea Central Committee, but we do not have the certainty that the North Koreans will give a positive response at the highest level.On November 7th, it is scheduled that several Soviet delegations visit Pyongyang, among which the Friendship Association, a group of party activists (on vacation), the choir and dance ensemble from the Pacific military fleet, etc.2. On the issue of Soviet-Korean relations, G. Chubotarenko pointed out that these are very good, and he emphasized in this respect that in the last quarter only six or seven Korean military delegations at the level of Deputy Minister went to the USSR, that a few days ago they signed an additional protocol for goods worth 10 million rubles, that this year 100 undergraduate students and 50 graduate students and Korean interns came to the Soviet Union for their studies. The Soviet diplomat mentioned that the USSR and the DPRK have recently perfected a series of new accords on various topics, which entail an intense exchange of delegations and cadres. G. Chubotarenko showed that there are intense exchanges on military issues as well, meaning that a lot of North Korean officers are currently receiving their advanced training in the USSR, and that hundreds of specialists – Soviet advisers on areas related to navy, air force and missiles are currently operating in North Korean military units, where they are offering technical assistance to the North Koreans.3. On the issue of the recent Plenum of the Workers’ Party of Korea Central Committee, we noticed that the Soviet diplomat sought to minimize the gravity of the removal from the Korean party leadership of two of the members of the Central Committee, and of all other cadres, underlining instead that according to the information gathered by the Soviet Embassy, the removal of the respective elements from the party leadership was the result of several mistakes committed by these people, rejecting the idea that they were an anti-party and anti-Kim Il Sung faction, as rumors in the diplomatic corps have it. G. Chubotarenko pointed out that they knew that Pak Geum-cheol [Pak Kum Chol], the former member of the Politburo Presidium of the Central Committee of the Workers’ Party of Korea, was guilty of not understanding the political line of the party, for which he was removed from his function and appointed the head of a factory in the countryside. All the other former party cadres were guilty of even more serious mistakes, which plighted the revolutionary movement in South Korea.Signed: N. Popa\n",

Lazar said that he had not attended the discussions of the two delegations, but afterwards, he had noticed that the Korean Workers’ Party had not taken a firm decision with respect to its participation in the international meeting in Budapest. With respect to the other issues raised by Surgov, the Romanian diplomat said that they had not been discussed in detail and that he could not decipher the intentions of the North Koreans as these issues were mentioned in passing.Surgov said that he raised the first question because Soviet and Czech diplomats in Pyongyang were spreading the rumor that the delegation of the Romanian Communist Party tried to influence the leadership of the Korean Workers’ Party to take part in the international conference in Budapest and to adopt a similar position to its own. A. Lazar said that the Romanian Communist Party had been consulting and would continue to do so with all parties on the main problems of common interest and on the matters of the international communist movement and it would be wrong to think that this activity was an attempt to exert influence. A. Lazar said that if the Soviets, or any other [party], believe that the Korean Workers’ Party can be convinced to take part in the conference or dissuaded from doing so, they should carry out this kind of action themselves, as the organizers of this conference in Budapest.On a different matter, the Bulgarian diplomat said that T. [Todor] Zhivkov cancelled his visit to Havana, arguing that he could not have subscribed to the claims of the Cuban leadership with respect to the anti-party Soviet cliques which had been discovered and unmasked recently within the Communist Party of Cuba.Signed: N.

      "The North Korean press released a declaration from the DPRK Ministry of Foreign Affairs with the title ‘The Korean people are effectively prepared and always ready to fight alongside the Vietnamese people, whenever the Vietnamese people need it,’ through which the North Koreans condemned the atrocities committed by the United States in South Vietnam.The document underlined the unanimous support for the February 4 declaration of the spokesman of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front in South Vietnam and the February 5 declaration of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.The North Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the US aggression against the Vietnamese people is also an act of aggression against the Korean people and therefore, upon the request of the Vietnamese people, the DPRK is always ready to offer it all the help it needs.The declaration asked for the immediate and unconditional termination of all American warmongering activities, and for the most urgent withdrawal possible of American and foreign troops in Vietnam.Signed: N.

      "On February 14, the Bulgarian Second Secretary, Surgov, told A. Lazar that the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party would hold a plenum to debate a series of ideological issues.All Bulgarian diplomatic missions in socialist countries were asked through a note to compile a summary of the new aspects and trends in the ideological activity of the Korean Workers’ Party; its general activity and specific methods for agitation and propaganda; the training programs for top cadres; the latest measures or trends to improve the activity of the party and state apparatus; and the general planning and organization of scientific research in the DPRK.Surgov mentioned that he discussed these issues with two Soviet diplomats, which helped him realize that these diplomats had radically changed their views on Kim Il Sung. Surgov pointed out that Soviet diplomats were increasingly disgruntled with Kim Il Sung and thought that ‘the independence with which he makes decisions on his own’ is the product of the full development of his cult of personality.The Bulgarian diplomat answered one of A. Lazar’s questions by pointing out that the Soviets, when referring to Kim Il Sung’s independence, alluded to the decision of the Korean Workers’ Party not to participate in the consultative meeting in Budapest, to the USS Pueblo case, and to the fact that the North Koreans decided not to consult [the Soviets] on the ways and especially on the moment when unification ought to be achieved, etc.Signed: N.

      "Following the events in Seoul on January 21 and the USS Pueblo incident [on January 23], one can notice a conspicuous cold attitude on behalf of the Vietnamese diplomats (from the delegation of the National Liberation Front, NLF, and from the Embassy of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam) toward the North Korean comrades.In a recent discussion between the Romanian Ambassador and Vu Ngoc Ho, the representative of the NLF in Pyongyang, the latter stated with unrestrained anxiety that the North Koreans, in an attempt to underline the alleged similarity between the situation in South Korea and that in South Vietnam, affirmed that just like the revolution in South Vietnam cannot endure for too long without the help of North Vietnam, so the revolution in South Korean needs the help of North Korea.This uninspired comparison referring to the revolutionary situation in the southern parts of the two countries was sensitive for the Vietnamese diplomats, because, according to the Czech Ambassador, they were the ones to approach this issue openly in many conversations with members of other socialist diplomatic missions in Pyongyang.We believe that there are other factors contributing to this deterioration [of relations between the Vietnamese and the North Koreans], namely the USS Pueblo incident and the incident in Seoul, through which the North Koreans muted any similarity of the events in Vietnam, which took place at the same time, attracting the attention of the international public opinion on contingent actions without any prospects and without an adequate revolutionary basis (in South Korea—our note).On the occasion of the Army Day Anniversary in North Korea, the two Vietnamese delegations sent only staff at the level of ‘First Secretary’ to the many activities organized by the North Koreans (the Ambassador invoked health problems and the NLF representative left Pyongyang before February 8).Signed: N.

      "We would like to draw your attention to the fact that, over the past few days, war preparations have intensified in both Koreas. People in South Korea are fearfully talking about the massive concentration of North Korean troops in the vicinity of the demilitarized zone, so as to carry out a surprise attack, while the North keeps stressing the news about how the United States and the South Korean authorities are ready to unleash a new war on the DPRK.On both sides, military provocations continue in the vicinity of the 38th parallel, with increased intensity and frequency, leading to frequent meetings of the Military Armistice Commission in Panmunjeom. In an interview granted to the Korean Central News Agency (ACTC) on February 17, Pak Seongcheol, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, underlined that the situation in Korea is extremely tense; that the Americans and Park Chung Hee are the only ones to blame in case of a resumption of the war in Korea, given the intensity of their aggressive provocations; that any reprisals toward the USS Pueblo incident from the United States and South Korea will trigger the resumption of war; that the outbreak of war and its absence depends entirely on the United States and South Korea, etc.We also noticed that both the radio channels and the press are increasingly using terms like: ‘we are awaiting the order of our leader to liberate South Korea,’ ‘we are ready for the liberation of the South.’ North Korean categorical statements have multiplied: ‘we will respond to retaliation with retaliation;’ ‘we will respond to war with war,’ etc.Judging from the current situation, we believe that these intense preparations and massive movements of North Korean troops of all categories to near the demilitarized zone are not so much dictated by self-defense concerns but by the intentions of the DPRK to launch a surprise attack to unify the country, by capitalizing on an incident caused by the South and on the current circumstances in Vietnam, where the United States finds itself in an unfavorable situation.We believe the North Korean authorities want to take advantage of the chaos and disorder existing in the South and not give the South enough time for mobilization, for physical and psychological preparations, as well as for the deployment of the latest technologies recently promised by the United States to South Korea. They [the North Koreans] also do not want to miss this auspicious moment created by the situation in Vietnam. Given the fact that the DPRK leadership cannot conceive of the reunification of the country without the use of force, we believe that the beginning of the unification depends on finding the most propitious moment, by all means not after solving the Vietnamese conflict, the USS Pueblo incident, or after the restoration and strengthening of the South Koreans’ fighting capacity.Signed: N.

      "I would like to convey the following notes I took during my February 19 conversation with Le Thet Hung, the Ambassador of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to Pyongyang:1. Two offensives are being carried out by the forces of the National Liberation Front in South Vietnam and are part of a tactical cycle which aims to continue the fight and gain the initiative while expanding the battlefield.The main purpose of these large-scale offensive actions is to shatter to the ground the regime in Saigon and thus rally the entire people to take up arms, to counter all the actions of the Saigon army, to divide it and isolate it from the American troops.Secondly, [the aim is to] simultaneously attack all American bases and inflict severe damages in terms of personnel, materiel, and military equipment; to create even more confusion; to disrupt the ranks of the American military and of its satellites; and to weaken their morale, which is already very low anyway.These offensives offer the opportunity to fully resupply the troops in South Vietnam with weapons and ammunition, which are so needed to maintain and further the successes they achieved so far.2. According to the Vietnamese diplomat, the United States of America will not dare and will not be able to use tactical nuclear weapons in South Vietnam. He pointed out that since South Vietnam was not an organized battlefield, without a front and a back, the use of tactical nuclear weapons would be more damaging for American troops and bases than for the national liberation forces.Secondly, the United States would not dare to use tactical nuclear weapons fearing that the Soviet Union and the People’s Republic of China would retaliate.Thirdly, the United States is also fearful of public opinion and the American people, which are increasingly opposed to the war in Vietnam.3. When asked whether the upcoming elections in the United States would influence the resolution of the conflict in Vietnam, the Vietnamese diplomat said that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the National Liberation Front are not linking the matter to the upcoming elections. The future elections would only change the wolf at the helm of the United States with a different one.4. My interlocutor then mentioned the fact that ‘some’ try to draw a comparison between the war and the revolution in South Vietnam and the war in Korea. He said that such a comparison did not make any sense, being completely unrealistic. It is imbued with wishful thinking, it denies the nature of the mass revolution of the Vietnamese people, and it does not recognize the efforts and successes achieved by the Vietnamese people (we believe that these references were made with certain North Korean personalities in mind).5. When asked for his opinion on the timing of the Korean unification, the Vietnamese diplomat said that the North Koreans are intensively preparing for this action and it would be possible that when the United States is almost crushed in South Vietnam, the North Koreans will take advantage of this moment and pursue the liberation of the South.6. As for the USS Pueblo case, the Vietnamese Ambassador said that the Americans were not interested in starting another war in Korea because they would be easily defeated there just as they are in South Vietnam.It seems that the peaceful resolution of this case through direct negotiations with the Americans would also be to the liking of the North Koreans, who realize that they are not yet totally ready [for war] and that it is not a propitious moment to pursue such a large-scale operation in the South.Signed: N.

      "On February 22, I was invited to meet with Pak Seokkyun, the Director of the Second Directorate–Liaison within the DPRK Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who gave me a set of materials on the USS Pueblo incident, comprising the translations of the Pueblo crew members’ testimonies, original copies of these testimonies, and photographs. All these documents were released to the public a while ago.In his statement, Director Pak made reference yet again to the well-known aspects of the incident, underlining that it can be solved peacefully only if the United States admits to the criminal act it had committed by deploying the USS Pueblo spy ship in the territorial waters of the DPRK. He remarked that in the current situation of maximum tension, war can break out at any moment in time and the American imperialists are the only ones to blame, adding that the future of the USS Pueblo depends entirely upon how the United States and their puppets in Seoul act.Pak Seokkyun expressed his gratitude for the manner in which our central press agency and the propaganda agencies in Romania reflected the Korean position with respect to the USS Pueblo incident, and then he underlined that in the current circumstances, it was paramount to thoroughly unmask the aggressive policy of the United States. He added that he would like to ask the Romanians to step up their condemnation of the US aggressive policy, including through governmental actions (here he was obviously hinting at the release of a governmental statement or at least of a statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs).With respect to the USS Pueblo case, I would like to inform you that the declarations of the People’s Republic of China, Democratic Republic of Vietnam, National Liberation Front in South Vietnam, the Communist Party of Cuba, the Mongolian Ministry of Foreign Affairs were published, while the foreign ministers of the German Democratic Republic, Czechoslovakia, and Soviet Union apparently held talks with the Korean ambassadors in their respective countries, under the guise of press interviews.We believe that for the time being, there are no special actions that the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs should take to preempt a recurrence of the USS Pueblo incident. The most appropriate form of support for the North Korean position is to continue to reflect the situation based on the news broadcast by the Korean Central News Agency (ACTC).The materials we received will be sent to Bucharest through courier.Signed: N.

      "On February 22, M. Sindler, the attaché of the Czechoslovak Embassy in Pyongyang, told A. Lazar that the head of the Czechoslovak delegation to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Panmunjeom had talked to General Pak Jeong-guk, the head of the North Korean delegation about the following issues:After the first two or three secret meetings between the North Koreans and the Americans, General Pak Jeong-guk has been avoiding the Czech and Polish generals, or when he does meet them, he does not mention anything about the USS Pueblo incident.After the eighth secret meeting, Pak told the Czech general that the North Koreans would be willing to free the Pueblo crew members in exchange for some South Korean patriots ‘who are imprisoned in South Korea.’ The North Korean general said that if the Americans had agreed to this exchange, the North Koreans would have renounced the demand that the United States recognize that they had violated the territorial waters of the DPRK, however they did not wish to get too much publicity on this.When asked by the Czech general about the position of the US Army on this matter, Pak said that the North Koreans had not discussed this with the Americans because they expected the Americans to come to them with this proposal.Sindler said that the Czech general realized that Pak told him about this idea so that this proposal, through the Swedish or the Swiss delegations in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, immediately reached the Americans, who would then bring it up at Panmunjeom.The Czech diplomat said that until that moment, discussions at Panmunjeom had been limited to the demands of the DPRK that the United States admits to being guilty of violating North Korean territorial waters. The American representative supposedly asked the North Koreans to allow him to pay a visit to the USS Pueblo crew members in order to corroborate the North Korean version of the story, which would then enable the Americans to admit to having violated North Korean territorial waters.Taking into account the possibility of talks between the United States and the Vietnamese, which has come up again and again these days, we believe that the North Koreans will try to solve the Pueblo case before the American-Vietnamese negotiations begin and this will be done to refute any speculations that the resolution of the Vietnamese matter depended on ending the row over USS Pueblo.Signed: N.

      "On February 26, at a meeting with the North Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs, we were given a comprehensive presentation which concluded that the situation in Korea had become extremely tense and the outbreak of war was possible at any moment and that the provocations of the Americans and of Park Chung Hee made war inevitable. The Head of the Construction Section told A. Lazar that all diplomatic missions in Pyongyang were encouraged to build an anti-air defense bunker, in case they did not have one already, to protect foreigners against air attacks.When asked by the Romanian diplomat about the characteristics of the bunker (depth, shape, resistance) and about the deadline by which this bunker ought to be finalized, the interlocutor answered that after the agreement in principle of the Romanian government, the ODCD [Office of Services to the Diplomatic Corps] would immediately send a group of experts and specialists to the embassy to decide on where to install the bunker, and in accordance with the specific requirements of the ODCD, it would put together the project and the approval and would start the construction work.With respect to the deadline, he replied that the sooner, the better, as the situation was rapidly deteriorating.In conclusion, the Korean interlocutor made some vague references to the peaceful intentions of the DPRK, to its desire to prevent grave things from happening, but in the end he emphasized the peril of the resumption of war and the desire to insure the anti-air defenses of foreigners.With respect to the situation in Korea we would like to inform you about the following things:A state of general tension prevails in Pyongyang; troop movements and neighborhood anti-air defense drills continue; night alarm drills using planes and floodlights are intensifying; in Pyongyang and in the suburbs, anti-air bunkers from the Korean War have been restored and new bunkers have been built between apartment buildings and next to every single household. Trenches and pits for shooters are being dug, especially at the periphery; and general camouflage measures have been adopted (outside of Pyongyang, trucks and buses circulate only covered in camouflage nets, etc.).An intense evacuation operation is being carried out in Pyongyang (probably in other densely populated centers as well). The archives of central institutions, a significant part of the State Library and of the Academy, more than half of the machinery used in the Typographic Complex and probably in many other factories have been moved out of Pyongyang.Given that the Foreign Ministry urged us to provide an answer regarding the size, shape and location for the anti-air bunker for our embassy, we would like to ask you to give us your approval for this construction first, and if possible, to send us a civil engineer, with the mandate to decide on the project and to supervise the execution of this construction work.We are asking for this since the planning and the execution of the construction work only by locals does not present sufficient guarantees to usWe are awaiting your response.Signed: N.

      "On February 28, the Korean Central News Agency published a statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman on the extremely tense situation on the Korean peninsula.After mentioning that over the past year the provocative acts of the American occupiers and their puppets in Seoul have intensified, the statement mentions that, at the moment, the forces of the South Korean army, acting under the protective arm of the United States, are feverishly preparing for war, ‘which creates a very grave situation in Korea so that war can erupt at any point in time.’The Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman refutes the attempt of the South Koreans and the United States to put the blame on the DPRK for the current situation and assign guilt to the DPRK for the January 21 events in Seoul and for the illegal capture of the USS Pueblo vessel. The document underlines that the American imperialists are trying to use the USS Pueblo case to find a pretext for unleashing a war, ‘which is made clear by the fact that, at the negotiating table in Panmunjeom (on this issue—our note), they are not in possession of even the most basic form of scrupulousness, instead creating only obstruction with their hostile positions.’The conclusion of the declaration points out that ‘as long as the American imperialists are undertaking aggressive and warmongering acts, without assuming responsibility for them (here the North Koreans are pointing to the Pueblo incident—our note), and pursuing war maneuvers and blackmailing the DPRK, the current situation of extreme tensions cannot be diffused.’A day before, the Korean newspapers published a lengthy op-ed along the [party] lines which dealt with the tasks to be assumed by the Korean population in the current circumstances of ‘maximum tension’ and in case a war breaks out. The piece is imbued from the beginning until the end with an emphasis on the sacred duty of every worker and soldier in the People’s Army to ‘arm himself with the great revolutionary ideology of comrade Kim Il Sung, to reject all other ideologies except for this one, to think and to act only along the ideological lines and the will of the leader, to unconditionally carry out the orders and the indications of the leader, to defend with their own lives the Central Committee of the Korean Workers’ Party, led by comrade Kim Il Sung.’The article also stresses the need for a speedy development of the economy and defense capabilities, and emphasized on the duty of each economic unit to be ready and prepared to produce in the most critical conditions, on the need to efficiently run the military-strategic areas, to rapidly develop the military industry, to create stocks of provisions and fuel, etc.According to Radio Seoul, significant amounts of American weapons (part of the additional $100 million aid agreement) have already been shipped to South Korea.By the end of the month, South Korea will mobilize up to one million soldiers from their 2.5 million reserves, a threshold to be achieved by the summer of 1968.All South Korean localities are organizing self-defense units, which will be equipped with the light weapons from the South Korean Army, given that the South Korean Army will receive the new weaponry from the United States.Signed: N.

      "On January 22, 1968, a Seoul radio station continuously broadcasted special news bulletins on the armed clash that took place on the outskirts of Seoul on January 21 around 10:00 pm between the city police and ‘an armed group of diversionists and spies from North Korea’ (more than 30 people).According to the information provided by the radio station, the clash in question, which is the first attempt on behalf of elements from the North to attack premises in the South Korean capital, resulted in the death and injury of several South Korean civilians and policemen. For the North Korean side, as of now, five people were killed, two were captured alive, and the rest of the group withdrew to the North. The South Koreans continued to pursue them, but they couldn’t find anything more than abandoned weapons and military equipment.The South Koreans declared an emergency situation in Seoul and the surrounding areas, forbidding movement [of citizens] during the night and taking measures to prevent the infiltration of new elements [from North Korea]. According to the testimony of one of the North Koreans who was captured alive, the purpose of the incursion was to attack the presidential palace in Seoul and to shoot President Park Chung Hee. In the DPRK, the 024 Special Unit is currently preparing eight more groups of 300 people each to deploy in guerilla fights against South Korea. The prisoner declared that the military group he was a member of crossed the border on January 17 and was supposed to return [to North Korea] via the same path.In our opinion, although the purported aim of this incursion in Seoul seems unlikely to us, we believe that this action was incredibly daring and narrow-minded. This attempt to attack a location in Seoul represents a seriously alarming sign about the implementation of the hard line [policy] promoted by the DPRK, which seeks to force and hasten a forthcoming great revolutionary event—the unification of the country through the use of force.We believe that this action, which created panic and tension in South Korea (they convened a special parliamentary session on January 30), will only aggravate the situation in Korea and will give rise to new conflicts between the two sides.We believe that the North Koreans will give a different interpretation of this action, denying their involvement in this event and will probably explain this violent act as a manifestation of the increased revolutionary spirit of South Korean masses against the regime of Park Chung Hee.Signed: N.

      "On January 24 at 9:00 pm, Kim Jaebong, the DPRK Deputy Foreign Minister, summoned the chiefs of all diplomatic missions from socialist countries accredited to Pyongyang and the representative of the National Liberation Front (NLF) from South Vietnam to the North Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs to inform them of the capture of the American military ship USS Pueblo weighing 1000 tons by the North Korean coastguard after [the ship] ventured deep into North Korean waters. The Deputy Foreign Minister explained that the ship was observed at a distance of 10 miles away from the coast and was captured after it advanced up to 7.6 miles away from the coast in the waters of the bay formed by the Hodo Peninsula and the Yeodo Island.Kim Jaebong informed the diplomats that the ship was meant exclusively for intelligence gathering (focusing in this case on the military bases on the coast), having, at the same time, a great quantity of arms on board. The crew numbered 83 people, of whom six were officers, 75 were sailors, and two were civilian technicians. One member of the crew died following fire exchanges, which resulted from the crew resisting measures undertaken by the North Korean military; three people were injured, one of whom was gravely injured.Judging this provocative act directed at gathering intelligence as the most outrageous one [committed by the United States] since signing the Armistice [in 1953], the Deputy Foreign Minister asked the chiefs of diplomatic missions to report back to their governments on this new and serious provocative action undertaken by the American imperialists and expressed his conviction that the governments [of socialist countries] would take the appropriate actions and vehemently condemn these pirate-like acts.He laconically added that it was likely for the situation to become worse because the American imperialists had already deployed an important unit from the Seventh Fleet to the seas neighboring the DPRK.Answering the questions of certain ambassadors, Kim Jaebong declared that although the DPRK had not publicly announced the width of its territorial waters, he said, for the personal use of those present, that the DPRK had a territorial waters width of 12 miles.He added that his government was going to release a declaration on this matter.Judging from the sources of the Czechoslovak Embassy, which was promptly informed by its delegation in the Armistice Commission, we know that the USS Pueblo was captured by the North Korean coastguard when it was 16 miles away from the DPRK shore, while press agencies stated that the ship had been 25 miles away from the shore when it was captured.We believe that, owing to the uncertainty around the conditions in which the incident took place, it is not advisable for us to take any particular measures. Nevertheless, we suggest that our press organs publish the news issued by the Korean Central News Agency, quoting the sources it uses, as well as inserting a line about the forthcoming declaration of the North Korean government.Signed: N.

      "1. On January 24, propaganda organizations in the DPRK issued elaborate news bulletins with regard to the actions undertaken by the armed groups who are dealing blows to the American and South Korean units in the ROK.According to the South Koreans, South Korean units and American troops are pursuing the North Korean group which initiated the attack on January 21 in Seoul and which is currently retreating towards the DPRK. Out of the 31 members of the group, 15 people were shot in isolated clashes with the South Koreans and one was taken prisoner.Judging from the way the North Korean press is presenting the situation in the ROK, we realize that they are exaggerating a great deal and they purposely distort the truth so as to create the impression of a truly revolutionary state of mind. Although news reports are also concerned with the twentieth anniversary of the creation of the DPRK Army, the North Korean press is in the midst of an intense campaign against the Americans and the South Koreans. Scenes from the fighting during the war and the liberation of Seoul in 1950 cover the pages of North Korean newspapers almost entirely.2. At the same time, it was announced that on January 22 an American military ship was captured [by the North Koreans] in the waters of Wonsan Harbor (it was not specified whether in the territorial waters of Wonsan—our note).3. The South Korean radio station announced that the ship in question, weighing 906 tons and having a crew of 83 people, was captured from international waters and forced to enter Wonsan Harbor. This action was meant to make the emerging situation [on the peninsula] even more tense; the state of the South Korean army and fleet was changed to ‘fighting’ mode, and the American aircraft carrier Enterprise departed from the Japanese port Sasebo and will be stationed in the waters in front of Wonsan harbor in the DPRK.4. Judging from the things we’ve remarked upon recently, over the last three days the North Koreans have established many military checkpoints; they carry out daytime and nighttime raids; throughout the city there are more and more armed groups of civilians (even 4 to 5 people); the nightshift guards for embassies have doubled; and an increasing number of policemen are posted in front of embassies. This explains the recently enforced prohibition on foreigners traveling outside of Pyongyang.5. We believe that the provocations which have emerged recently are attributable to the North Koreans entirely and in this way they put into practice the motto: ‘let us be ready and take initiative to welcome the forthcoming great revolutionary event of the reunification of the motherland.’Although the North Koreans are currently testing the nerves and feeling out the attitudes of all elements in South Korea, including the US, towards a potential large-scale military confrontation, we believe it is not impossible that the aggravated situation in South Korea will lead to the resumption of hostilities (stopped in 1953).Signed: N.

      "Since the North Koreans refuse to release the American military ship [the USS Pueblo] that they captured on January 22, the US authorities have deployed two other air force fighter units from Okinawa to South Korea, in addition to a part of the Seventh Fleet which is in the Sea of Japan, probably with a view to intimidate [the North Koreans] or even with a view to use them. These two [air force] units will be based next to Munsan and Gunsan in the vicinity of the DMZ.Moreover, all American air force units in Japan have been instructed that they will take action against the DPRK if necessary, as long as the North Koreans do not release the captured American vessel.Signed: N.

      "On January 24, Aurelian Lazar had a discussion with S. Golosov, Second Secretary of the Soviet Embassy in Pyongyang, during which Golosov told Lazar that Soviet diplomats were extremely worried with respect to the unrestrained actions undertaken by the DPRK against the ROK (the January 21 attack in Seoul) and against the USA, manifested in the capturing of the military vessel AGER-2 [the USS Pueblo]. The Soviet diplomat pointed out that if the DPRK continued to undertake such initiatives to speed up the reunification of the country, it would be possible for the Soviets to be presented with a fait accompli in the sense of the resumption of an all-out war.S. Golosov said: ‘the North Koreans know the unfavorable position of the USSR towards the intentions and the tendencies to hasten reunification through the use of force and therefore we are afraid that we will not be consulted; and this situation is caused by the fact that we do not know the dynamics of Sino-Korean relations and the attitude of the People’s Republic of China towards the Korean issue, particularly in its recent form shaped by the DPRK [since the January 21 attack].’ Lastly, the Soviet diplomat added that the North Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been trying, at all levels, to find out the answer to one pressing question: ‘Whether the USSR will help the DPRK and in what form in the case of the resumption of an all-out war on the Korean Peninsula.’ ‘When we try to moderate this warmongering state of mind,’ Golosov added, ‘on many occasions, our position is not taken into account.’The Soviet diplomat pointed out that there is a possibility that the North Koreans, taking advantage of the fact that the USA does not intend to get involved in a new conflict in Korea, are using the tense situation to make clear some aspects of the KWP’s [Korean Workers’ Party’s] internal and external policies, and intentionally caused the incidents on January 21 and January 22.Commenting on the article written by Paul de Groot and published in the Korean press on January 17 and January 18, Golosov described it as being utterly anti-Soviet and that its publication represents a negative answer given to the organizers of the Consultative Meeting in Budapest in February [1968]. The publication of this article, the Soviet diplomat added, ‘strengthens our opinion that Soviet-Korean bilateral relations, except for economic relations, which the North Koreans are keenly interested in, have started to deteriorate. (our note—Golosov hinted at the fact that the Soviet government might have been too optimistic to think that an intensification of economic aid would make the North Koreans accept the political conditions which came with it).On a different topic, the Soviet diplomat showed us that recently elements which the [North Korean] security apparatus could not trust have been removed from the city of Pyongyang. Golosov said that he knew for a fact that Kim Il Sung had left Pyongyang for the countryside a while ago (at least a few weeks).With respect to a question from the Romanian diplomat about the urgent departure to Moscow of the Soviet Ambassador to Pyongyang ten days ago, the Soviet diplomat said that his ambassador was supposed to return to his post rather quickly but, given the recent events in Korea, his return was postponed by another week.In my opinion, the Soviet Ambassador to Pyongyang was invited to go back to Moscow to give an explanation on the recent events in Korea and the likely outcomes [of these events].Also, in my opinion, the Soviet Ambassador to Pyongyang provided misguided information to his government about the situation in Korea, in the sense of an exceedingly optimistic perspective and in total contradiction with the real situation and the intentions of the DPRK leadership with respect to the reunification of the country.Signed: N.

      "On January 26 Aurelian Lazar had a talk with L. Kaoskovcki, Third Secretary of the Polish Embassy, who told our diplomat the following:1. At the meeting of the NNSC [Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission] in Panmunjeom on January 24, attended by Polish representatives, the North Koreans and the Americans, contrary to their usual hardline and rude postures, exchanged their views in an extremely calm atmosphere, but with resoluteness, which denotes the great caution with which they are handling the situation. The North Koreans refused to discuss the January 21 incident, arguing that it cannot be the subject of the Armistice Commission, given that it was an act of South Korean patriots. As for the capture of the American ship, the North Koreans claim that it [the USS Pueblo] violated their territorial waters and it is therefore its prisoner, together with its entire crew.2. The Polish representatives at Panmunjeom were surprised at the promptness of the DPRK’s acceptance of the meeting proposed by the Americans to discuss the incidents on January 21 and January 22. According to the Polish diplomat, this fact denotes that the North Koreans, as the instigators of these incidents, anticipated the request for this meeting and had prepared an answer in advance.3. The Polish diplomat said that he had been informed that from January 10 to January 12 North Korean troops and peasant-worker guards conducted joint military exercises in the south of the DPRK. The senior leadership was satisfied with the outcomes of these exercises. Moreover, he pointed out that during the evenings of January 22 and January 23, several military units and workers’ guards departed from the Pyongyang railway station.4. On January 22 the North Koreans announced to the Polish Embassy that a military facility would be erected in front of the Embassy and, more exactly, they would start working on an underground facility, which, according to the Polish diplomat, would function as either the entrance or the exit for a great underground bunker in Pyongyang.5. The Polish representative told A. Lazar that the Polish Embassy was preparing its staff, especially the female personnel, to receive the news of the outbreak of a large-scale military conflict with as little panic as possible.Signed: N.

      "The Chargé d'affaires of the [Embassy of the] German Democratic Republic in Pyongyang told A. Lazar on January 26 that on that day he had had a meeting with Pak Seongcheol, member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers’ Party, Vice President of the Cabinet and Foreign Minister of the DPRK, to whom he delivered a letter from the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany together with the speech of Walter Ulbricht regarding the need to adopt the new constitution of the GDR.On this occasion, the German diplomat asked Pak Seongcheol for his opinion on the current situation in Korea.Pak Seongcheol did not make any comments regarding the incident in Seoul on January 21, describing it as an act carried out by patriotic South Korean groups. With respect to the capture of the American ship USS Pueblo, the North Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs pointed out the following: ‘The American ship violated the territorial waters and undertook provocative acts against the DPRK. The decision to capture it was based on the principle of self-defense. The North Korean government will take the same form of action in the future, capturing or even sinking any enemy ship which violates North Korea’s territorial sovereignty. If the US undertakes any acts of intimidation or uses force, the DPRK will reply through the same means, including force. The resolution of conflict depends entirely upon the Americans.‘The government of the DPRK is the only authority to decide whether to free the crew or not.‘We are content with the fact that the Soviet Union refused to mediate the matter of the captured vessel. We will regard those who will accept the United States proposal to mediate this matter as friends of the Americans.’Signed: N. Popa\n",

      "On January 26, from our discussion with Esmat Naguib, Chargé d'affaires of the United Arab Republic to Pyongyang, we noted the following issues:1. On January 25, Naguib was summoned to the North Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs and informed about the capture of the American espionage ship [USS Pueblo] by the North Korean coast guard for violating the territorial waters of the DPRK.On this occasion, the Arab diplomat asked the Deputy Foreign Minister, Comrade Heo Dam, whether it was true that the United States had asked the Soviet Union to press the North Korean government to free the American vessel and its crew.The Deputy Foreign Minister replied that the DPRK would never allow a third party, no matter whom, to meddle in this matter, which is under the exclusive authority of the DPRK. The Deputy Foreign Minister concluded that any request of this sort will be considered as interference into the internal affairs of the DPRK.2. The Arab diplomat said that according to the information he had received, the recent actions by the DPRK in Seoul and the capture of the American vessel were carried out with the aim to effectively and directly help the North Vietnamese people and with the consent of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. We believe the statements of the Arab diplomat are unsubstantiated and likely pure speculation.3. Naguib said that he had received information from the Cambodian Chargé d'affaires in Pyongyang that, following the meeting of Prince Sihanouk with the American Ambassador to India and the position Prince Sihanouk adopted toward his [American] interlocutor, the leadership of the DPRK became extremely dissatisfied [with Prince Sihanouk], which will probably lead to a deterioration of the relations between the two countries.4. With respect to the briefing we gave to Naguib about the activities undertaken by our country to celebrate the Day of Solidarity with the Arab people, he conveyed his gratitude and praise for the honest and consistent policy adopted by the government of the Socialist Republic of Romania towards his country, reminding us that other socialist countries, which initially made a lot of noise, changed their initial position on the Middle East bit-by-bit. He was briefed once again on the position of our country on the problems in the region and on the solutions for these problems.5. The Arab diplomat said that his country was dissatisfied with the moral support offered by the DPRK to his country, adding that this support is currently almost nonexistent.Signed: N. Popa\n",

      "On January 27, the DPRK Deputy Foreign Minister Heo Dam summoned the chiefs of diplomatic missions from all socialist countries in Pyongyang to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to whom he presented the declaration of the DPRK government on its position towards ‘the campaign of calumnies and threats launched by American imperialists’ in the aftermath of the capture of the USS Pueblo, as well as the discussion of the issue in the Security Council of the United Nations.A note from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was attached to the document for the diplomatic missions of socialist countries in Pyongyang in which they were asked to present the text of the declaration to their respective governments, hoping that the position outlined in the declaration would resonate well with those governments, which would then undertake the appropriate measures to actively support it. The note did not ask for a reply.After justifying the capture of the USS Pueblo as a self-defense measure and stating that the threats and blackmailing undertaken by the aggressors would not frighten the North Korean people, who are always ready to repel any sort of aggression, the document condemned the fact that the incident was discussed by the United Nations Security Council. The document describes the discussion of this internal matter of the DPRK as illegal and advised the UN not to repeat its shameful history as a tool of aggression against the Korean people.We believe it is advisable to explore the possibilities to insert a paraphrased text of the aforementioned declaration in our press, quoting its source; a reserved position towards the Korean request would upset the Korean leadership, which we should avoid, especially now that our bilateral relations are experiencing a turning point in their development.The title of the declaration was released on January 27 by the Korean Central News Agency ACTC.Signed: N.

      "On January 29, D. Tsvetkov, First Secretary of the Soviet Embassy in Pyongyang, informed comrade A. Lazar about the following:1. On two different occasions, the Soviet Chargé d'affaires visited Pak Seong-cheol, the Foreign Minister of the DPRK, to inform him about the US proposal for the USSR to mediate the USS Pueblo incident and about the Soviet refusal to do so. Pak Seong-cheol appreciated the position of the Soviets, underlining that it proved [the Soviet Union] respected the sovereignty of the DPRK.Our opinion is that, through the two meetings with the Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Soviets probed the position of the North Koreans towards the incident and towards the prospects of resolving the situation.2. Tsvetkov said that on January 27 the Soviet Ambassador to Pyongyang returned to his post, and that he would be ready to take action to moderate the Korean leadership, bringing it back with its feet on the ground, but he would not act until the position of the People’s Republic of China was known (maybe it will be too late—our note). ‘We believe that it is not impossible that behind the Koreans stand the Chinese, and if Soviet advice runs against the Korean line, that may bring about the exact opposite outcome from what we envision,’ said the Soviet diplomat.The fact that the Soviet Ambassador returned to Pyongyang on a special plane makes us think that he did not come back alone, but together with several other Soviet leaders, to discuss the current situation with the Korean leadership.3. The Soviet diplomat showed that the Soviet air fleet in the Pacific was ordered to move close to the military ships deployed by the US from its Seventh Fleet in the Sea of Japan.4. With respect to the internal situation, Tsvetkov said that Soviet diplomats thought that the DPRK had secretly called for general mobilization and that they obtained reliable information that large troop movements were being moved towards the southern and the eastern borders.Signed: N.

      "From our discussions with M. Golub, the Ambassador of Czechoslovakia to Pyongyang, on January 29, we gathered that a dialogue between the representatives of the DPRK and American envoys took place and is expected to continue.With the help of the four neutral generals, Freeman, the Chief of Staff of the Third American Army stationed in South Korea, warned the head of the North Korean delegation at the Armistice Commission that in the event North Korea opened fire on South Korea, the armed forces of the United States would use the most modern means and weapons available, including the nuclear bomb, against the North Korean people. The document released by the United States asks the North Koreans for detailed information about the health of the USS Pueblo crew members.General Pak Jeong-guk answered both verbally and in writing that these threats did not intimidate the Korean people. He then discussed the health of the USS Pueblo crew members, warning that if the US tried to liberate the 83 crew members by force, they would only retrieve their corpses. According to Golub, it is promising that a dialogue on this issue began, even though the parties involved are using very harsh language.Based on the briefings received today from the general in Panmunjeom, the neutral parties believe that the current situation is extremely dangerous. Golub informed us about some of the latest developments, which only make the current situation worse; he told us that the entire South Korean army was carrying out drills and preparations in response to the new and exceptional state of affairs, under the command of General [Charles H.] Bonesteel; six additional mining ships and torpedo boats were moving towards the DPRK waters; and two Soviet ships were stationed in the vicinity of the American carrier USS Enterprise, to monitor its activity.It is foreseeable that, in the future, more ships from the Soviet Pacific fleet will move to this area.Golub remarked that among the latest developments was the fact that members of the North Korean military delegation in Panmunjeom started to describe the USS Pueblo crew members as ‘prisoners of war,’ which means that the North Koreans did not intend to bring them before court.Describing the continuation of diplomatic activity to solve the conflict as a positive development, the Czechoslovakian diplomat mentioned that South Korea had recently invited U Thant to Seoul to show him the ‘revolutionary circumstances’ which the North keeps touting. At the same time, he pointed out the fact that Robert Kennedy advised President Johnson to urgently explore the possibility of signing a bilateral treaty with the Soviets to refrain from intervening in the case of a war in Korea, based on the legal commitments that the two countries have towards North Korea and South Korea, respectively.M. Golub pointed out that only the Soviet Union would have the influence over the DPRK to ameliorate the situation, since it is beyond any doubt that the Chinese would push the events towards a military conflict.Signed: N.

      "In a discussion on July 5th, between A. I. Lazar, our Second Secretary, Nguyen Long, Second Secretary and delegate ad interim of the National Liberation Front (NLF) in Pyongyang, the latter, out of his own initiative, told A. I. Lazar that following an agreement between the Cuban revolutionary government and the NLF, it was established that Cuba appointed a permanent delegate to the NLF. In this respect, the Cuban government appointed the former Cuban press correspondent who had spent his previous two years on the freed territories in South Vietnam.Nguyen Long mentioned that in case other countries were interested to send diplomatic delegates or press correspondents to the freed territories in South Vietnam, the NLF would insure, to the best of its abilities, the necessary conditions in which they can pursue their activities. In reply to a question asked by A. I. Lazar, the Vietnamese diplomat said that the North Koreans were aware of this offer from the NLF but so far it had not manifested its wish to send a permanent delegate to the NLF. Actually, Nguyen Long said, the North Koreans had plenty of people active in South Vietnam. He added that “They are active in those areas where South Korean troops are operating, so as to study their fighting tactics, techniques combat readiness and the morale of the South Korean Army, and to use propaganda against the South Koreans.” Nguyen Long said that the DPRK was planning to send even more people to South Vietnam but they were confronted with language difficulties, as they don’t speak Vietnamese.The activity of these North Koreans operating in South Vietnam is coordinated by a member of the North Korean embassy in Hanoi, who has strong ties with the NLF representatives in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

      "On the occasion of an exchange dinner offered to Van Pen, the charge d’affaires from the Chinese Embassy on July 27th, we discussed several aspects dealing with domestic politics in the DPRK.1. Regarding my comment that at the most recent Plenum of the Workers’ Party of Korea, it became visible that the composition of the Central Committee Politburo Presidium was reduced by half (excluding President Choe Yong-geon [Choe Yong Gon], who, because of his old age and poor health, is less and less present in the policy-making process of the WPK), Van Pen confirmed the definite disappearance of three of the most prominent leaders of the Korean revolution. He was referring to Pak Geum-cheol [Pak Kum Chol], Ri Hyo-sun [Ri Hyo Sun] and Kim Do-man [Kim To Man], Secretary of the Central Committee and Head of the Propaganda Section of the Central Committee, who were joined most recently by Kim Jong-hang [Kim Chong Hang], the Minister of Higher Education, and Rim Chun-chu [Rim Chun Chu], the Secretary of the Presidium of the Supreme People’s Assembly. The Chinese diplomat mentioned that according to the investigations carried out by his embassy, Ri Hyo-sun’s elimination was the result of the exposure of the spy network that he had been coordinating in South Korea and across the border.As for Pak Geum-cheol, the ideologue of the Party, and other cadres in the same department, they were eliminated because of a serious ideological split within the WPK on matters related to the role of some Korean personalities in the revolution and construction of socialism in the DPRK. Pak Geum-cheol and Kim Do-man did not make enough propaganda around Kim Il Sung’s cult of personality. ‘It is perfectly reasonable for Pak Geum-cheol, the only leader from the current structure who during the harshest years of anti-Japanese fighting operated and endured with great heroism inside Korea, not to accept that all the credit for the revolutionary and socialist construction in the DPRK goes to Kim Il Sung, who spent the entire period of the revolution in China and in the Soviet Union, in much milder conditions,’ said Van Pen. He added that by purging the aforementioned officials and those working in the Propaganda Department, the last nationalist personalities who were in favor of friendly relations with the PRC ceased to be make their voices heard in the press and in other propaganda media. Instead, the noisy popularization of those who played a negative role in the evolution of Sino-Korean relations has been increasing at a fast pace. This phenomenon undoubtedly triggers a feeling of sorrow for those who are aware of the human and material sacrifices on behalf of the Chinese people who jumped to the aid of the North Korean people. Van Pen mentioned that during the Korean War, Beijing used half of the credits and aid it received from the USSR in the years following the Revolutionary War, to fund the Korean liberation war (1950-1953) and for the post-war reconstruction of the country. The funds borrowed by China from the Soviet Union were paid back to the last dime.In response to my question whether the North Korean comrades paid back these loans, at least partially, Van Pen said that to this day, China had not seen any money, but it was not asking for it. ‘We don’t even have the gratitude of the current leadership of the DPRK for our sacrifices.’When asked his opinion on the low intensity of North Korea’s mobilization efforts to liberate South Korea, manifested after the most recent party Plenum, Van Pen said that only one thing is certain: that as long as Sino-Korean relations are maintained in their current state, North Korea cannot launch any offensive against the South. As a matter of fact, the US keeps saying that a country having tense relations with China will not wage war against the US. When asked whether China would help the DPRK with armament just like in the previous war, should the North Koreans still proceed to liberate the South, currently under American occupation, Van Pen replied that China would eventually intervene but only if radical changes had taken place in Korea (here, he probably referred to a change in the Korean leadership).Throughout our discussions, Van Pen repeatedly praised the remarkable successes attained by Romania in all areas of activity, as a result of the just policy adopted by the Romanian Communist Party. He stated that the independent policy carried out by the RCP had a positive impact on others, who have not yet managed to become fully independent. Signed: N. Popa\n",

      "In a discussion with A. Lazar on July 29th, the First Secretary of the Czechoslovak Embassy in Pyongyang, I. Horjenevski, pointed out the following issues:1. ‘Although the DPRK did not pay back its old loans in July, it came to us to ask for new credits, amounting to 400 million rubles.[’] The Czech diplomat mentioned that the North Koreans  asked for this five-year credit to modernize and expand the production capacity of five industrial plants, among which he mentioned the underground equipment plant at Hoecheon (built by Czechoslovakia during the war), a military chemical plant and three other plants. Because the request of the Koreans exceeded the current technical capacity of Czechoslovakia and implicitly [they exceeded] the acquisition by the Czechs of modern equipment and machinery from the West, and given that the conditions under which the North Koreans could pay back the loan were disadvantageous [to the Czechs], the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic refused to grant the DPRK the loan.I. Horjenevski underlined that Czechoslovakia has had a very unpleasant experience with giving loans to the DPRK, as North Korea is very bad at paying back its dues: it makes lots of promises up to the moment when it gets the credit and then, it invokes all sorts of pretexts to change the terms of the payments as it sees fit.‘We don’t like to we buy machinery and equipment from the West, paying a very high price in hard currency, for Korea to send us in exchange ceramics, glassware, magnesite and … promises of tinted metals.’On the issue of the cooperation agreement between the academies of Czechoslovakia and North Korea, which was signed recently in Prague, Horjenevski said that in this area the North Koreans had made some very bold requests once again. For instance, the DPRK managed to secure funding from Czechoslovakia for the training of ten specialists and researchers for two and three years each. Also to the advantage of the Koreans, Czechoslovakia will send teams of specialists and technicians to the DPRK, to work in areas like cartography, geology, etc.2. On a different topic, the Czech diplomat informed A.I. Lazar that on July 22nd he had a talk with Kim Gyeong-yeon [Kim Kyong Yon], the Deputy Head of the Foreign Relations Department in the Workers’ Party of Korea Central Committee, who told him that at the Plenum Meeting of the Central Committee of the Workers’ Party of Korea, there had been several divergences on matters related to the political and economic planning arrangements adopted at the Party Conference from last year. Kim Gyeong-yeon said that ‘within the party leadership, there were some elements that did not understand and opposed the economic development and defense strategies devised at the Party Conference, which postulated the parallel development of the two domains. At the Plenum, these elements were fiercely fought against, and some of those who proved hostile to these lines after the October 1966 Party Conference were removed from their party functions.’The diplomat said that the Deputy Head of the Foreign Relations Department in the Workers’ Party of Korea Central Committee avoided giving the names of those removed from their functions, and instead of answering the question that the Czech diplomat asked, underlined that ‘currently, we are emphasizing more than ever on maintaining the monolithic unity of our party around Kim Il Sung and the Central Committee, even if it means putting our lives on the line.’ A. I. Lazar mentioned that this crucial statement from Kim Gyeong-yeon has lately appeared more and more frequently in the North Korean press. I. Horjenevski added that on the occasion of his recent visit to the Workers’ Party of Korea Central Committee, he noticed soldiers armed with automated guns on the hallways of the Central Committee headquarters, in addition to the usual security officers who have been assigned fixed positions.Signed: N.

      "On June 12, the Chinese charge d’affaires offered me a dinner, followed by a movie titled ‘The 17th Anniversary of the People’s Republic of China National Day and the Three Nuclear Tests Performed by the PRC.’ Ionescu Teofil was also invited.From the ensuing conversations, I noted the following matters:1. With respect to Sino-Korean relations, the Chinese counselor said that the Chinese authorities are aware that the North Koreans are lying to their people about the assistance that the PRC is offering to the DPRK. If China did not offer North Korea and if China adopted the attitude that the North Koreans are imputing it, then no ton of steel would exit the gates of the metallurgical plant, and textile factories would close down. (The DPRK uses coke coal supplied by the PRC to cover the demands of its industry – our note).The Chinese diplomat said that the attitude of the North Korean leadership is based on three elements:a. By denying China’s assistance and cooperation, the North Koreans try to justify the lack of a wide variety of foodstuff and consumer goods in front of the North Korean population. The Chinese diplomat said that the masses, however, do not believe what they are told and they are aware of the assistance that China is giving, they have faith in the collaboration and friendship of the Chinese people.b. By adopting a negative attitude towards China and denying Chinese assistance, the North Korean authorities are trying to obtain material advantages from other European socialist countries, especially from the USSR. If North Korea had not undertaken any anti-Chinese activities, the USSR would not have given it anything.From our conversation, I gathered that we are witnessing a new phase of Sino-Korean relations. For instance, at the moment, a Chinese team of specialists working on military and civilian telecommunications and a team working on electronics are in North Korea. A Chinese team of specialists working on oil exploration just returned from North Korea. Chinese specialists are currently building the tower of the new television station.Recently, the Chinese government finished its equipment deliveries to North Korea and from now on it will offer technical assistance to the DPRK for assembling and organizing production at a new factory for transmission-reception portable military radio stations.China keeps giving North Korea military assistance, in other words, nonrefundable aid, in the form of: gasoline and fuel for jet planes.2. In my conversation with the Chinese diplomat, I touched on the topic of the party leadership purge, which I discussed in telegram no. 76.203.The Chinese official said that 80% of the reasons for the removal of these officials were clear. The remaining 20% refers to clarifying the reasons for which Pak Geum-cheol [Pak Kum Chol] was purged. These are very difficult to establish as Pak Geum-cheol was Kim Il Sung’s right hand man.3. The Chinese diplomat repeatedly praised the multilateral political and economic achievements of our country, under the leadership of the Romanian Communist Party. He said that China appreciates its relations with Romania and the fact that they were continuously developing, to the interest of both countries and peoples, of the triumph of the socialist and Marxist-Leninist cause. The Chinese diplomat said that the Chinese comrades had recently returned from Romania saying that the Romanian industry was developing at a fast pace, producing modern and highly technical equipment. The fact that Romania is supplying China with this equipment represents a precious contribution to the development of socialism in China.Signed: N. Popa14.VI./6\n",

      "The Polish First Secretary told Comrade T. Ionescu that the US Ambassador to Seoul informed the Swedish Ambassador in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission about the following matters:At the time of the sinking of the South Korean escort boat No. 56, the US and South Korea decided that their air forces bomb several defense units on the North Korean coast.This plan received the approval of the two governments in Washington and Seoul respectively, but it was postponed at the last minute owing to the evolution of operations in Vietnam.The US Ambassador told the Swedish Ambassador that this decision would be implemented whenever the North Koreans would attempt similar attacks.The Polish diplomat said that they interpreted the statements of the American Ambassador as dishonest, being in fact an attempt to prod the North Koreans to reveal their intentions and to frighten them at the same time. However, the Polish Ambassador continued, it was not unconceivable that the US had actually taken this decision, with the thought of implementing it in the future. [‘]The Americans and the South Koreans are aware of the North Korean military capabilities, especially the situation of the [DPRK] air force, which would not allow the North Koreans to undertake defensive actions against or to counterattack against an air attack from the South or to improve their air defense.[’]The Polish diplomat thought that the North Korean reaction to the incident was interesting, probably after he had heard the point of view of the US Ambassador.If immediately after the incident the Pyongyang authorities prided themselves in sinking the ship, started a vast press campaign, congratulated and decorated the subunit involved in the sinking, all these manifestations ended abruptly and the whole event was forgotten. Additional measures were taken so that in the future nobody can open fire on a target without Kim Il Sung’s approval.According to the Polish diplomat, this reaction indicates that the North Koreans are rather afraid of a potential confrontation and are not prepared to withstand it.Signed: N Popa28.II./5   \n",

      "On March 1, a diplomat from the Hungarian Embassy in Pyongyang, S. Erte, told A. Lazar that during a recent conversation between the Hungarian Ambassador and Kim Changbong, the Minister of Defense of the DPRK, the Korean official asked the Hungarian authorities to approve his visit to Budapest with a Korean military delegation (which was supposed to take place in May—our note) at the beginning of April. The Korean official explained that this date is imposed on him by the situation in Korea and by the fact that after April 20 it would be impossible for him to travel abroad. Kim Changbong’s statement, linked with the fact that only four or five days ago all diplomatic missions in Pyongyang were urged to build anti-air bunkers, leads us to conclude that for a period of at least two months from now, the situation in Korea will not aggravate beyond the current point.On a different topic, the Hungarian diplomat showed that he possessed information according to which two weeks ago Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai had sent a personal message to Kim Il Sung through which he had proposed to jointly normalize Sino-Korean relations and to leave past quarrels behind. In the same message, Zhou Enlai mentioned the traditional friendship between the Chinese and the Korean people and reassured Kim Il Sung of the candor with which the Chinese people would be ready at any given point in time to give its full support to the Korean people.Asked about the source for this information, the Hungarian diplomat said that he had obtained it from the Chinese and that the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs asked its diplomatic mission in Pyongyang to verify it, if possible.Signed: N.

      "On February 2, talks resumed in a very good atmosphere.Judging from our talks with the North Korean comrades, our positions are very similar or even identical.1. I am copying here the entire account of their position on the USS Pueblo incident.‘I would like to talk about the violation of our territorial waters by the armed espionage vessel and the counter-measures we took to defend ourselves.‘We are not trying to inflate this matter but the American imperialists are trying to use this incident to launch a larger-scale military operation against our country and they seek to aggravate the situation even more.‘No matter when and where these American imperialists try [to attack us], our people will deal them a powerful blow. However, we do not believe that the USS Pueblo incident provides a good enough reason to go to war and therefore we are trying to solve the matter peacefully.‘However, if the Americans threaten us, the matter will not be solved.‘In order to solve all problems appropriately, the Americans should put an end to all threats and military blackmail against us, and they should do this not through words but with actions.‘We are not paying attention to empty words and articles written by journalists.‘Moreover, if the American imperialists want to solve this matter peacefully, they would have to turn the circumstances back to how they were before the occurrence of this incident.‘Therefore, the nuclear carrier and all other ships and military troops should be withdrawn to prevent the deterioration of the situation.‘Moreover, the American imperialists demand that we apologize to them for this incident and that we pay damages and return everything unconditionally.‘We will not enter negotiations with them under these conditions and we will not kneel down when confronted with such threats. We are determined to fight if we need to fight.‘Under these circumstances we would like to thank socialist governments for their support.‘You, the Romanians, have also helped us tremendously and we are certain that you will help us with these matters even more in the future.‘In the given circumstances, we need to strengthen our unity with socialist countries, with the Soviet Union, with China, with all communist countries, with all anti-imperialist countries, so as to fight adamantly against imperialists and reactionaries.’2. With respect to the international meeting of communist and workers’ parties, the basic position of the Korean comrades is in essence identical with ours.They mentioned that they made their position known, as clearly as possible, to the Soviets.With respect to the meeting in Budapest, they said:‘We were not informed nor consulted in advance on this matter either and we do not really know how the meeting was convened. We have a tense situation here now, we are faced with lots of complicated problems, so we couldn’t have really extended talks within our leadership circles and we did not take a decision yet, but we hope to discuss this matter later on and decide.‘We understand the position of the Romanian Communist Party, we do not have a different position on this and we do not have any objection on the participation or the non-participation of certain parties to this meeting.’3. The delegation will leave the country on Sunday morning, February 4, and will arrive in Bucharest during the evening.Signed: N. Popa\n",

      "On March 13, in a discussion with A. Lazar, Han Seong-ho [Han Song Ho], the head of the External Relations Section of the ‘Rodong Sinmun’ newspaper made the following remarks with respect to the ‘great revolutionary event,’ which the North Korean press and people in general have been increasingly talking about:‘We understand this event as a multifaceted preparation – political, economic and military, for the liberation of South Korea and the unification of the country.’Han Seong-ho explained that even if the driving force for the unification of the country should be the South Korean people, North Korea assumed responsibility for granting South Korea all the necessary assistance (to achieve this goal).He added that, currently, ‘our main goal is to as secretly as possible organize those forces which would uplift the South Korean people to fight for their liberation.[’]In addition, he emphasized that the existing spontaneous and isolated movements in South Korea, stemming from economic grievances were randomly organized by disgruntled elements and not by revolutionary organizations, which have other objectives and which are supposed to rise to the surface only at the right juncture.‘If between 1950 and 1955 we missed the opportunity to unify our motherland, Han Seong-ho added, that was only the result of our lack of organization and our unawareness of the forces and the revolutionary circumstances in South Korea. This time, however, we will efficiently apply the lessons of the past.[’]When A. Lazar asked about what the North Koreans mean by saying that the task to unify the country was pressing and that it belonged to the young generation, Han Seong-ho replied that the DPRK was ready to help the South Korean people whenever they requested Pyongyang’s help. As for the timing and shape of this event, Han Seong-ho remarked that these aspects were unknown, yet he added that ‘the demarcation line on the 38th parallel will not stop us from supporting the revolutionary struggle in the South, because this is not a border but an artificial line, imposed and guarded by American imperialism with a view to keeping Korea divided.’ Subsequently, Han Seong-ho added that ‘the crossing of the 38th parallel to the South will only be opposed by the enemies of the revolution. Since we will not attach India, Turkey or any other country, nobody has the right to condemn the way in which will solve an internal problem, which belongs to the Korean people.’‘It is self-explanatory, Han Seong-ho added, that our main intention is to achieve unification by peaceful means, but given the present conditions in Asia, there is little hope left for peace and therefore we ought to be prepared  for anything, including war.’Signed N.

      "On March 13, as you requested, I visited Baek Nam-un, the President of the Supreme People’s Assembly of the DPRK, to whom I handed over the letter of president [of the Romanian Great National Assembly] Stefan Voitec, through which [Voitec] invites Baek Nam-un to visit Romania this year with a Korean parliamentary delegation.After thanking me for the letter of invitation, the president [Baek Nam-un] said he would be very glad to visit Romania and to this end he would kindly consider the invitation in the light of the current situation in his country and the responsibilities he would assume in the Supreme People’s Assembly this year.From my conversation with him, I gathered that he had not received such invitations from any other similar bodies in European socialist countries.Talking in general about the situation in his country, Baek Nam-un said that the Korean government was determined to solve the USS Pueblo case from an activist position, keeping the initiative on its side, without allowing itself to become intimidated by the threats and the pressure exerted by the United States.Baek Nam-un’s remark that, ‘if the United States dared to attack us, we look forward to it, because this will mark their defeat and their definitive expulsion from our land,’ seemed particularly noteworthy.All other matters discussed will be included in the minutes of conversation.Signed: N.

      "On March 16, in a conversation with A. Lazar, the Czech Second Secretary M. Hoholushek, the latter said that he had found out from Soviet sources that the DPRK Minister of National Defense, Kim Changbong, asked (on the occasion of his visit to Moscow in February—our note) Leonid Brezhnev for an assurance that, in case of the outbreak of war on the Korean peninsula, the Soviet Union would promptly intervene to the defense of the DPRK.The Czech diplomat added that throughout the three-hour conversation [with Kim Changbong], Brezhnev persisted in trying to persuade the Korean minister against resuming the war in Korea, underlining that just like in the case of Vietnam, this war would be a very tough one to win. The Korean minister pressed for at least a principled agreement from Brezhnev, which, to our mind, would be enough for the outbreak of war.Brezhnev concluded that if the DPRK had ignored his opinion, the USSR would not have replied positively to Korean calls for help.Hoholushek said that Soviet diplomats in Pyongyang believed that if Brezhnev had given some sort of nodding signs or vague assurances, a war in Korea would have definitely broken out.A. Lazar asked for the opinion of the Czech diplomat with respect to the new measures adopted by the Korean authorities regarding the interdiction of driving in the city from midnight until morning, and prohibiting the circulation of all vehicles (including diplomatic vehicles) without free circulation passes stuck to their front windows. In a nutshell, the Czech diplomat described these restrictions, which only continue the series of restrictions adopted earlier, as an undeclared state of emergency.On March 16, Radio Seoul announced during its evening broadcast that starting with that date, the army and the workers-peasants red guards in the DPRK were in a state of emergency. No such official announcement was made in Pyongyang.Signed: N. Popa\n",

      "On March 16, A. Lazar had a conversation with Wang Peng, counselor and Chargé d'affaires of the People’s Republic of China, from which we took note of the following important aspects:Contrary to the harsh language used previously by Chinese diplomats toward the DPRK party and state leadership and DPRK internal and foreign policy, it was noticeable that Wang Peng completely changed his approach, having become an active supporter of the forceful line promoted by the DPRK.The Chinese diplomat has repeatedly underlined that the war preparations of the DPRK are welcome, since it is certain that the United States wants to expand the battlefield in Asia, not only in Vietnam, Thailand, and Cambodia, but definitely in Korea as well. He added that the outbreak of war in Korea is inevitable, a logical consequence given that the country cannot remain separated indefinitely and that for the DPRK, this would be a just liberation war.Wang Peng said that as far as he knew, both parties had made intense war preparations, but the sole difficulty was the poor political training of the masses in South Korea, whose training was comparably inferior to the South Vietnamese masses, to withstand a long-term war and offer substantial help to the liberating forces from the North.A. Lazar said that given the situation in both Koreas, he did not contest the possibility of war reigniting, yet the diplomatic corps commented on the idea that the United States had found itself in a preposterous position in Vietnam and that because of the upcoming elections it would be impossible to open a new front in Vietnam.Wang Peng answered that this idea had the potential to demobilize the Korean people and it did not mirror reality, because it was still possible that the Americans would start a war in less than a week or two. We, the Chinese diplomat added, share the conviction of the Korean comrades that war is drawing near and the People’s Republic of China has repeatedly declared that it would grant its full support to the DPRK.A. Lazar added that it was beyond any doubt that in case the DPRK was attacked, it would receive the full support of socialist countries and especially from the People’s Republic of China and the Soviet Union. In this respect, the Romanian diplomat added, it seems that Premier Zhou Enlai sent a message to comrade Kim Il Sung in which Zhou Enlai had assured Kim Il Sung of the support of the People’s Republic of China in its anti-American struggle.Wang Peng did not deny the existence of a message but with noticeable surprise he said he had not known about such a document, but judging by its essence, it wouldn’t be too different from the Chinese governmental declaration released immediately after the incident with the USS Pueblo spy ship.A. Lazar tried to find out more about the results of the recent Sino-Korean economic negotiations. In this respect Wang Peng, just like in our previous conversations with him, avoided giving any concrete facts, figures, but he said that the amount of commercial exchanges for 1968 had increased compared with 1967; that the Chinese, to the best of their abilities, had almost entirely satisfied the demands of the Koreans, especially in terms of coke, coal (2 million, in terms of last year’s supplies), cotton, tires, salt supplies, etc. Wang Peng avoided giving a full answer to the question referring to the number and branches in which Chinese specialists are working in the DPRK, but he pointed out that Korean demands for technical-scientific assistance have multiplied lately and these demands include matters related to technical-military items. After pointing out that Sino-Korean bilateral relations have been reinvigorated and that the prospects for mitigating past quarrels are good, Wang Peng said that ‘I started to realize that at the basis of Soviet-Korean relations lay no political-ideological principles and the DPRK would have manifested its personality earlier on if it hadn’t been tied to the Soviet economic and military aid.’ He added that the DPRK would have the opportunity to verify that in the upcoming war, the People’s Republic of China would be its most reliable friend.A. Lazar asked whether the Chinese Embassy received the [Romanian] Agerpress bulletin on the consultative meeting in Budapest. Wang Peng thanked us for the respective materials and said that he had been informed about it by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and about the position of the Romanian Communist Party at the meeting.After the Romanian diplomat briefly presented the point of view of the Romanian Communist Party adopted by the Central Committee of the RCP on February 14 and the decision adopted on March 1 with respect to the international consultative meeting, Wang Peng said that personally he held in high regard the efforts and the principled position of the RCP at the consultative meeting. Wang Peng added that through the meeting in Budapest the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union demonstrated yet again its desire to enshrine as urgently as possible the split in the international workers’ and communist movement.Signed: N.

      "In response to your telegram no. 12.390, we can make the following judgments:After a more in-depth study and after surveying other socialist diplomatic missions in Pyongyang, we concluded that the Korean Workers' Party does not practice experience exchanges with other socialist parties. Although we believe that the KWP is interested in knowing the experiences of other parties, owing to the reciprocity involved in exchanging delegations with other parties, the KWP is limiting itself to studying the experiences of other socialist parties without taking on any obligations. This method does not entail any advantages for the KWP, since all other European socialist parties, including the Romanian Communist Party, amply and publicly discuss their deontology, experience, successes and failures, and because through the Korean diplomatic missions in these countries and through various delegations sent to these countries, the North Koreans have the opportunity to study in depth the experiences of all other parties (without offering anything in return). When we make this assertion, we have in mind the fact that in the DPRK the statute of the KWP is an internal document, and all publicity about party activity is mere agitation and propaganda.The fact that there is no publicity around party activity, party methods and work practices, and when experience exchanges are requested the answer is always no, proves that there are serious deficiencies in the internal functioning of the KWP, which the North Koreans are seeking to hide by all means available. Given that the party secretary is also the leader of the military group or party organization, it cannot be expected that work methods, discipline etc. are too different from military methods, which, to our minds, renders experiences exchanges impossible.What is more, one should also consider the fact that the KWP does not want to establish an experience exchange with the Romanian Communist Party as a precedent for exchanges with other socialist parties.Our opinion is that the North Koreans will keep refusing any proposals for experience exchanges in the future, in the area of party work, as well as in the domain of lecturers exchanges, as the KWP is doing its best to prevent the North Korean people from finding out more about the achievements of socialist parties. In this respect, it is notable that the DPRK media is scantily mentioning the achievements of other socialist countries, the only available radio channel is Radio Pyongyang (meant also to counter the South Korean propaganda), the use of transistor radios is prohibited, getting subscriptions to publications from socialist countries is difficult, as most of the time, they can be purchased only by institutions, and, finally, the posting of photos and other visual materials on the poster board of embassies is prohibited, etc.Given that the Romanian Communist Party requested in two consecutive years that experience exchanges take place with the KWP and the North Koreans refused on both occasions, we recommend that this year no such request be made (emphasis in original). Instead, we recommend that in case it becomes absolutely necessary, the group of Romanian party activists who will come to the DPRK on vacation ask their hosts a briefing on their party workings.With respect to the exchange of editors-in-chief of the state press organs, we propose that the head of the Foreign Relations division of the ‘Rodong Sinmun’ newspaper be invited to Romania.We recommend the second half of July and the first half of August as the best time frames for these exchanges of journalists.Signed: N.

      "On May 9th, the Romanian labor union delegation was received by Kim Gwang-hyeop [Kim Kwang Hyop], member of the Politburo Presidium of the Central Committee of the Workers’ Party of Korea. I was also invited to attend this meeting. The following topics covered in the meeting drew my attention:After thanking the Romanian government for having accepted his invitation and for having sent a delegation to Pyongyang to celebrate, together with the North Korean people, May 1st, Kim Gwang-hyeop repeatedly emphasized on the good relations between the Romanian Communist Party and the Workers’ Party of Korea, on the fact that there is a total convergence of viewpoints between these two brother-parties, that there are no divergences which could slow down or cast a shadow on the development of these relations.Henceforth, he praised the impetuous development of Romania’s industry, agriculture, constructions; he appreciated the quality of Romanian products, their technical properties. He repeatedly underlined that in North Korea, the quality of goods and products is lacking and this is happening because of the lack of experience, technical tradition, and because of the need to build a lot and in a very short time, even to the detriment of quality and esthetics. (It is very rare for the Korean party leadership to publicly admit to this).He mentioned that according to the WPK conference of October 1966, the North Korean economy must develop in two directions. The main emphasis, however, is put on the development of the defense industry. Therefore, Kim Gwang-hyeop added, most investments are channeled into the defense industry, which makes the standard of living of the Korean population rather low and incomparable to the standard of living in European socialist countries. ‘Still, our people, Kim Gwang-hyeop added, is able to feed itself, to dress and to live.’He remarked that the standard of living would not rise unless the country is unified. ‘We make tremendous efforts, he added, to elevate the consciousness of the masses, so that they can understand that the current low standard of living is not caused by the socialist regime, but by the general situation of the country, divided as it is, occupied by the Americans in the south, which prevents the reunification of the country and forces North Korea to spend enormous amounts of money to defend itself and to be prepared to liberate the South at any given point in time.’In conclusion, Kim Gwang-hyeop, on behalf of comrade Kim Il Sung, asked the head of the Romanian delegation to send his best wishes for health and happiness to comrades Nicolae Ceausescu, Chivu Stoica and Ion Gheorghe Maurer. The meeting lasted for one hour and took place in a friendly, comradely atmosphere. The Romanian delegation will leave Pyongyang by plane on May 10th. Signed: N. Popa9.V./11\n",

      "Twenty three days after requesting an appointment, on May 13 I was received by Ri Jong-ok [Ri Jong Ok], the vice-president of the Cabinet of Ministers of the DPRK. (emphasis in original)On this occasion, I handed over the letter on behalf of Vice-President Gheorghe Radulescu, referring to economic cooperation proposals with the DPRK.Ri Jong-ok did not make any sort of comment on the substance of the letter, limiting himself to thanking me for the document and telling me that he would get back to us after examining it more carefully.Among other topics discussed in this meeting, my interlocutor underlined the fact that the DPRK was facing a series of difficulties caused by the presence of Americans and Japanese in South Korea, which forced the North Koreans to reanalyze their 7-year plan and direct it towards strengthening their defense capacity. This situation resulted in a decrease of production output growth (from the planned 18% to 14%) and, implicitly, to the extension of the initial terms of the 7-year plan up to 1970.Ri Jong-ok showed that the technical level in North Korean factories was low, the qualification of the work force was lacking and the quality of constructions and especially of consumer goods was well below demand.It is worth mentioning that among the issues raised by Ri Jong-ok is the condemnation of Japanese militarism.In this respect, he stated that Japan was just as dangerous as the US, as it was just as responsible for the war in Vietnam as the US and it represented a threat for Asia and especially for the DPRK, and it was creeping back into South Korea and under the influence of the US and of the South Koreans it was committing all sorts of discriminatory acts against the DPRK (they are repressing the democratic education of Korean residents, they refuse economic exchanges, they reject the participation of North Koreans sports teams in competitions organized in Japan, etc.) Politically, Ri Jong- said, Japan was a school of perversion and therefore an enemy against which the Korean people should fight just as much as it was fighting against American imperialism.Signed: N.

      "On May 17th, I was received as an official guest by Kim Il, the first Vice-President of the Cabinet of Ministers of the DPRK.During our conversation, Kim Il made a brief presentation on the internal situation for me, insisting on the hardship experienced by the North Korean economy, and on the causes for which the deadline set for completing the 7-year plan was extended by three years.Regarding the current state of the economy, Kim Il said that both the DPRK industry and the agriculture were developing normally and that both sectors presented the likelihood to meet the planned standards. Serious difficulties are encountered in the field of transportation, especially railway transportation.Invoking the threat from the South, Kim Il showed that a great share of North Korea’s material, physical, and human efforts were aimed at strengthening its defense capacity. My interlocutor mentioned that the budget allocated to the military sector was much greater than the 31.2% envisaged in the financial planning for this year, and it was impossible for this situation to not to have a negative impact on the overall economy and the population’s standard of living.Without making any references to the domestic or foreign policies of our country, Kim Il asked about the health of our party and state leaders.More details about this conversation which lasted for one hour and a half are to be found in the minutes of conversation.Signed: N.

      "The Embassy of the Hungarian People's Republic.Top Secret.Pyongyang, 20 May 1960.Subject. Conversation with Deputy Foreign Minister Yu Chang-sik on some questions concerning Korea's foreign and domestic policies.Upon my request, on the nineteenth of this month I was received by Comrade Yu Chang-sik, Deputy Foreign Minister, whom I asked for information concerning the DPRK's relations with Africa. In his answer, Comrade Yu told me that on the occasion of the Republic of Guinea's declaration of independence, an exchange of telegrams occurred between the two countries by which they mutually recognized each other, but did not realize any further relations in the fields of diplomacy and the economy. Except for this, they have no connection to Black Africa; in the recent past, there was only one military delegation visiting Conakry. Of course, they support to the utmost the struggle of the African peoples against imperialism and colonialism and are making efforts to unmask American imperialism and its Syngman Rhee-like satellites—especially in the Afro-Asian countries—in front of the greatest possible public and to isolate them. Concerning the Afro-Asian countries, the comrade deputy foreign minister mentioned that they have a trade representation in Cairo, and based on an agreement last year, they will open a trade representation endowed with the rights of a consulate in Baghdad. As is known, they have trade representations in India, Indonesia and Burma.In answer to my question, Comrade Yu briefly described the visit of the Algerian government delegation to Korea. The delegation, headed by Krim Belkassem, arrived for a friendly visit and showed great interest concerning military questions. They spent a lot of time in the Museum of the Patriotic War, where they asked for detailed information, and then they also visited the Military Academy. Members of the delegation stated that the Korean people's fight against American imperialism inspires them too, and they gained a lot of experience during their visit. Concerning the latter, Comrade Yu mentioned that this opinion is shared by the Koreans as well. He told me that the Algerians declared that “after driving out the French colonizers, the people of Algeria will act the same way the Koreans did.”Moving on to South Korea, the comrade deputy foreign minister expressed his view that the situation is unfolding, and this is setting new tasks for the DPRK. The possibility of unification is getting nearer; at the moment, their aim is to establish correspondence and transportation connections. There are several parties being formed in South Korea, which is progress compared to the past situation and offers a possibility for uniting the progressive forces. The South Korean movement is deepening and intensifying, and it is increasingly acquiring the character of a class struggle. The task of the DPRK is to accelerate the building of socialism, so the Party is now devoting great attention to further developing the national economy. The most important task now is the intensification of mechanization, especially in agriculture (they need approx. 20,000 tractors), and to raise the workers' living standards. In the DPRK, for example, the average production is 17 meters of textile per person per year, but the army and industry use a significant share of this amount. They want to raise the average amount to 30 meters per person. Therefore, the government has recently passed a resolution concerning the development of the vynalon production. At the moment, they are having difficulties concerning machines.At the end, the comrade deputy foreign minister expressed his thanks for the technical support provided by the Hungarian foreign ministry (cde. Bozi and Balogh), which he highly appreciated. Then he mentioned that recently the Hungarian periodical “Ország-Világ,” in one of its Korean reports, evaluated the “Chollima” movement in a different way than the Korean position. “We do not have any objection to this, our embassy raised the issue. It is possible that a foreign visitor might not understand this [movement] a hundred percent as a Korean might,” said the comrade foreign minister. In my response, I promised to look into the issue.signatureAmbassador Károly Práth\n",

M. PUZANOVfor the period 16 through 30 August 1957PyongyangSECRET[…]19 August.I visited Kim Il Sung and orally passed him CPSU CC information about the 1-2 August meeting in Romania between CPSU CC and Soviet government delegations and SKYu and FNRYu [Yugoslav] government delegations.Kim Il Sung thanked the CPSU CC for the information and expressed his opinion in the following words: the meeting went well; it is a new step in the path of strengthening the countries of the socialist camp and meeting our common interests, the interests of the socialist countries. In accordance with a USSR MFA instruction I informed Kim Il Sung that the Association of Korean Citizens Living in Japan had addressed a request for assistance in sending Korean citizens on Soviet steamships through the USSR to study at DPRK higher educational institutions. When doing so they referred to an alleged agreement that the Association has with corresponding DPRK authorities. It is planned to send 60 people to study in the DPRK this year.I asked Kim Il Sung's opinion on this issue.Kim Il Sung said that we can accept and help Korean citizens living in Japan study at DPRK higher educational institutions. But how do the Japanese see this, will they give exit visas? We have given agreement to give aid and assistance to those Koreans living in Japan who want to study at DPRK higher educational institutions. We base this on the fact that the Association of Korean Citizens Living in Japan do not have a bad attitude toward the DPRK.Kim Il Sung then said that if there is an opportunity then assistance ought to be given to send Korean citizens living in Japan on Soviet steamships through the USSR to study at DPRK higher educational institutions.In the conversation which took place Kim Il Sung stated his point of view on the comments by Gosplan and the State Committee for Economic Aid about the draft of the first DPRK five-year plan and provided information about the progress of the investigation of the case of the group of Choe Chang-ik, Pak Chang-ok, and others, and about measures being taken by the KWP CC to strengthen vigilance against intrigues by domestic and foreign enemies in connection with elections to the DPRK Supreme People's Assembly.Concerning comments and suggestions about the draft of the five-year planKim Il Sung reported that at a meeting in the CC he had heard a preliminary report from the delegation leader, Kim Il. Kim Il Sung said that the comments, advice, and suggestions were very good and correct and I completely agree with them. The Soviet comrades studied the draft of our five-year plan very closely, comprehensively, and deeply and gave valuable, skillful comments and suggestions. In all the work which was done there was felt the wish and a desire of the Soviet comrades and leaders to help the DPRK in every possible way to develop the economy and improve the population's standard of living.Kim Il Sung said that I gave instructions to Gosplan to make changes and amendments to the draft of the five-year plan in accordance with the recommendations. Today I gathered ministers and department managers, where I talked about the main comments concerning the draft of our five-year plan for the development of the economy for 1958.Kim Il Sung then said that the KWP CC Presidium did not give the delegation instructions to raise with the Soviet government the issue of an extension of the 240 million ruble credit which we have to pay in 1960-1961, and also about keeping the prices for monazite and zinc concentrate. At this point Kim Il Sung repeated three times and stressed that Kim Il raised these issues at his own initiative. He personally considers it correct and necessary to pay the credits. One hundred and sixty million rubles were already reserved for this purpose in the draft of our five-year plan. As regards the prices for monazite and zinc concentrate they need to be set at world princes as envisioned by the Soviet government. In reply to Kim Il's query about this issue I sent a telegram in this spirit which I thought over carefully and dictated myself. I suggested that Kim Il, inasmuch as they raised these issues at their own initiative without having instructions from the CC Presidium, not include these issues in the aide-memoire to the CC about the results of the trip to the USSR with the draft of the five-year plan. Kim Il's report about the results of the trip with the draft of the five-year plan will be heard at the next KWP CC Presidium meeting.Kim Il Sung warmly recalled the great attention, concern, and work done by Counsellor Makarov (Chairman of the State Committee for Economic Relations) and Adviser to DPRK Gosplan Lukovnikov.Concerning the group of Choe Chang-ik, Pak Chang-ok, and others. Kim Il Sung reported that the criminal activity of the group of Choe Chang-ik, Pak Chang-ok, and others directed at overthrowing the KWP CC leadership and DPRK government is being increasingly revealed in the course of the investigation and at Party meetings. He said that at a Party meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers' Directorate of Affairs former Administrator Yang Gye reported at his own initiative about a secret meeting of the group of Choe Chang-ik, Pak Chang-ok, and others at which they stipulated who will occupy what posts in the Party and government and planned the measures which ought to be taken to overthrow the leadership. For example, the post of Chairman of the Cabinet of Ministers was designated for Choe Chang-ik; Chairman of the KWP CC, for Kim Du-bong; Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ri Sang-jo; and Minister of Internal Affairs, Ri Pil-gyu. A new composition of the KWP CC Presidium was also planned.Kim Il Sung said that the group intended to prepare a group of workers who, while participating in a workers' demonstration passing by the reviewing stand on liberation day, 15 August, would stop at it and demand the overthrow of the leadership, and Seo Hwi (former Chairman of the CC of the Trade Unions) would arrest the leadership right there on the reviewing stand.According to Kim Il Sung's report, there was also an alternative plan for a terrorist act against him and at Choe Chang-ik's order Pang Hak-se, was given three blank passes for free passage to the Cabinet of Ministers. All these facts are being carefully verified right now.Kim Il Sung said with great indignation that as it is now increasingly being revealed business was consciously neglected in those ministries which were led by participants of the anti-Party group and everything was being done to provoke the workers' indignation. For example, the Ministry of Trade, a large quantity of goods were written off under the pretext of poor quality and spoilage and buried; a large quantity of textiles received from the Soviet Union was handed over to speculators. We will deal very harshly with the people who hid the goods and profiteered with them, we will judge and execute them. The Ministry of Construction deceived the government, reporting false information about the progress of construction. Some days ago the CC removed the managers of two Pyongyang construction trusts who were in particular building the Soviet Embassy and thus were dragging out the construction.Concerning preparations for elections to the DPRK Supreme People's Assembly.Kim Il Sung said that enemies are stepping up their activity in connection with elections to the Supreme People's Assembly. The South Koreans are dropping enormous quantities of leaflets from balloons (according to information available in the Embassy from 7 to 9 August local residents and KNA servicemen collected up to 29000 enemy leaflets in the provinces of North and South Hwanghae, Kangwon, and Chagang. MVD organizations arrested one Choe Chang [Sik], who had infiltrated from the South and testified that he was infiltrated with the purpose of organizing a rebellion in the area of Nampo. At the beginning of August a large quantity of leaflets produced on a mimeograph machine were found and collected in Hamheung and Sinpo. Kim Il Sung said that in the past 11 years no such quantity \"of local manufacture\" had been found (the Embassy knew that 800 leaflets had been found and collected). These leaflets contain reactionary propaganda directed against the policy of the DPRK and the Soviet Union. In one of the conversations with Nam Il I cautiously directed attention to an increase of vigilance and suspiciousness, and it was recommended that Cde. Ivanov, MVD specialist and consultant, talk about this in suitable form with Pang Hak-se, the Minister of Internal Affairs]).Although the overall situation here in the country is good, all these and other facts put us on guard and right now we are taking a whole series of steps to increase vigilance through CC and government channels. I spoke about this today at a meeting of ministers, and leaders of provincial committees and leaders of provincial MVD's [SIC] will be gathered about these issues.I noted for my part that the measures being taken by the CC are politically important and advisable since in a situation of political and labor enthusiasm in the country there are also many leaders who are complacent and do not exhibit vigilance toward enemy intrigues, and enemies striving to damage the cause of socialist construction usually take advantage of this.Nam Il was present at the conversation, which lasted two hours.[…]SOVIET AMBASSADOR IN THE DPRK[signature] (A.

N. S.

PUZANOVfrom 19 November through 28 December 1960 […]14 December 1960I paid a return visit to Romanian Ambassador Emil Stanciu.The Ambassador told of his reception by Kim Il Sung and Choe Yong-geon. During the reception Kim Il Sung talked in general terms about the situation in the DPRK and also provided information that a KWP CC Plenum had been convened on 20 December of this year which examined the results of the fulfillment of the economic plan for 1960 and the plan for the development of the DPRK economy for 1961; it also especially examined the issue of further measures concerning the development of agriculture.In reply to my question whether Kim Il Sung said that the report of the KWP delegation about the results of the Moscow Conference of Representatives of Communist and Worker's Parties would be heard, as Kim Il talked about this in a conversation with me, E. Stanciu replied that Kim Il Sung said nothing to him about this. During the conversation with Choe Yong-geon, the Ambassador said that the latter told about responses in South Korea to the decision of the 7th session of the Supreme People's Assembly. Then Emil Stanciu said that during protocol visits all the ambassadors, with the exception of the Albanian, Vietnamese, and Chinese [ambassadors], made critical comments without any questions from him about the fact that in their reports the Korean leaders are not telling the people about the great aid which the Soviet Union and the other socialist countries are giving the DPRK in the recovery and development of its economy. The Ambassador asked how correct this is.I replied to the Ambassador that in the last report at the 7th session of the Supreme People's Assembly Deputy Premier Ri Jeong-ok said nothing at all about the aid of the socialist countries to the DPRK in the recovery and development of its economy. Other reports made previously also spoke about this, but little. It could be said that on this issue the Korean comrades are exhibiting duplicity and inconsistency. On the one hand, for example, when they start up a particular enterprise built with the aid of the socialist countries, they speak quite broadly about this in the press; or, when preparing to meet Cde. N. S. Khrushchev rallies and meetings of blue- and white-collar workers are held at all enterprises and agricultural cooperatives. The Embassy has received over 37,000 complimentary letters and telegrams. In these telegrams and also, as we know, at the rallies and meetings of workers much was said about the enormous aid of the Soviet Union to the DPRK. On the other hand, very little is said in official reports about the aid of the Soviet Union and socialist countries or, as in the last report of Ri Jeong-ok, nothing is said at all.[…]SOVIET AMBASSADOR IN THE DPRK [signature] (A.

      "…26 February 1958I visited Nam Il and passed him the US government Statement about the issue of returning two American citizens to South Korea who were among the passengers of the aircraft which had flown into the DPRK on 16 February and the Aide Memoire of the FRG Embassy in Moscow about the return to Seoul of two FRG citizens who were among the passengers of this aircraft. Then I told Nam Il of the considerations described in the 25 February USSR MFA instructions.In the conversation which took place Nam Il said that the Germans and Americans will be returned in the next few days. As regards the South Koreans the government will decide the issue about them after an appeal by the appropriate South Korean authorities.Nam Il characterized the statement of the US government as rude, insolent, and distorting the actual state of the circumstances of the aircraft's flight into North Korea. Then he said that the MFA will make a Statement about the US government Statement and announce the return of the two Americans to South Korea.For my part I expressed the idea that it would have been more advisable for the Statement to have been made to the DPRK government. Report in this Statement about the transfer of the two citizens to the FRG, refute the US government Statement, then say that you are returning the two American citizens to South Korea, and in this same Statement talk about the return of the South Koreans. Such a Statement would once again show world public opinion the DPRK government's good will and readiness to solve such incidents in the spirit of benevolence and humanity.Nam Il agreed in principle with the suggestions [I] expressed and said that they will think over these issues when preparing a Statement.Nam Il reported that that KWP Party conference will open on Monday, 3 March and last four days. Up to two and a half days will be devoted to the discussion of the first issue, the plan of the first DPRK five-year plan, and a day and a half for discussion of the second, the intra-Party issue.xxxI visited Kim Il Sung and at the instruction of the CPSU CC passed him information about the 11 February conversation of the Soviet Ambassador in Washington and the nature of the assignment given the Soviet Ambassador in connection with this conversation.Kim Il Sung thanked the CPSU CC for the information. He then said that evidently the efforts of the Soviet government to convene a conference at a high level with the participation of the heads of government are being crowned with success. This will be good.I noted for my part that the peace policy consistently pursued by the Soviet Union and the proposals directed at lessening international tension are being met with enormous interest and attention in all strata of the world's population except, naturally, those who are devising aggressive plans to attack the Soviet Union and the countries of people's democracy. World public opinion has well received the proposals of the Soviet government to convene a high-level conference with the participation of heads of government and is demanding that the leaders of the US, Britain, and France agree to such a meeting. Our CPSU CC is doing everything necessary for such a conference to take place. There actually is confidence that such a conference will take place.In accordance with USSR MFA instructions of 25 February I told Kim Il Sung that the press and radio of the US and other Western countries are trying to use the case of the overflight of the DPRK by the South Korean aircraft and the delay in the return of the aircraft's passengers to South Korea to unleash a propaganda campaign. Their goal is to distract the attention of world public opinion from the proposals of the DPRK and PRC governments about the issue of the withdrawal of foreign troops from  Southern and the Northern part[s] of Korea and a peaceful settlement of the Korean question. I then said what a delay in the solution of the problem of the South Korean aircraft and the return of the foreign passengers to South Korea could lead to, and that in Moscow they hold to the opinion in connection with this that it would be advisable not to drag out the resolution of this incident and, if there are no special reasons or obstacles, to take steps to release the foreign citizens. I also passed on the other views described in the USSR MFA telegram.Kim Il Sung said that the issue of the return of the foreigners has already been decided. Good living and housing conditions have been created here for all passengers of the aircraft at the present time. They are getting to know Pyongyang. For example, they were at a textile mill. The South Korean citizens have stated that they are seeing such a large mill for the first time and were also very surprised at the large club this mill has.Kim Il Sung asked [me] to pass to the Soviet government that the foreign passengers will be returned to South Korea in the next few days. Today, said Kim Il Sung, I am inviting the Minister of Internal Affairs and the Minister of Foreign Affairs to my place and will consult with them about the place and procedure for handing over the foreign passengers. Kim Il Sung then said that evidently it is better to hand them over at Panmunjom. However, said Kim Il Sung, the question arises of how to deal with the South Koreans? Hand them over with the Germans and Americans, or leave [them] [ostavit']?I said for my part that this would be advisable and, it seems to me, it would be well-received by the public if the handover were done without delay and simultaneously. The corresponding statements of the governments of the US and FRG about the handover of the Americans and Germans are available. As Nam Il informed me, there is an appeal from the South Korean Red Cross to the Red Cross organization in Geneva for assistance in returning the South Koreans. Accordingly it could be said in the Statement of the DPRK government that the South Koreans are being returned without delay as soon as the appropriate representatives of the South Korean authorities or the South Korean Red Cross are at Panmunjom to receive their citizens.Kim Il Sung completely agreed with the stated suggestions. He then said that the MFA will be charged with preparing a Statement in which we refute the incorrect and absurd assertions of the US government that the government or any DPRK organization allegedly had something to do with the flight of the South Korean aircraft into North Korea; we will also talk in the Statement about the return of the foreign citizens.The prepared Statement will be examined by the CC on 27-28 February and after approval we will send it to the government of the Soviet Union.\n",

Kim Il said that according to the conclusion of the Soviet comrades the draft five-year was drawn up correctly, and there are comments a number of issues. Kim Il Sung said, I told Kim Il that you went to the Soviet Union with the draft of the plan to get comments and suggestions inasmuch as the Soviet comrades have rich experience in drawing up five-year plans.Nam Il, who was present at the conversation, familiarized me with a telegram received from Kim Il where it says that he had asked the Soviet Government to examine the issue of extending the payment deadlines for credits on military debts to 1959-1960 and to keep the prices for monazite at the 1957 level. Nam Il said at this point that Kim Il Sung gave instructions to Kim Il not to make such proposals. However, as is obvious, he had acted in spite of the instructions he had received.Kim Il Sung confirmed what Kim Il Said and added that audibility was poor during the telephone discussion and he told Kim Il to raise such issues as he considered advisable. Evidently, guided by this, Kim Il had also made this proposal. However, said Kim Il Sung, the debts really need to be paid , but to set the prices for monazite as the Soviet government wants based on current world prices for this raw material.Kim Il Sung then provided information that the draft of the first five-year plan will be published in the press for nationwide discussion and also examined at a conference of representatives of all levels of workers, at a KWP plenum, at the KWP Party conference (probably in January 1958), (and at a Supreme People's Assembly session, probably in February 1958).For my part I directed attention to the very great importance of the draft five-year plan for winning the sympathies of the workers of South Korea and for the peaceful unification of the country, in connection with which much agitprop work has to be done by skillfully organizing the explanation of the five-year plan both inside the country as well to South Korea.Kim Il Sung agreed completely.With the correct use of corn crops. Kim Il Sung was interested in my impressions of the prospects for the rice and corn harvests.I managed to see many crops and as a result formed the impression that the rice seems good and the corn crop situation is especially pleasing. In spite of the drought when there was no rain for 60-70 days (Pak Jeong-ae, who was present, corrected [me], saying there was no rain for more than 90 days), the corn survived and evidently produced a harvest greater than last year (the 1956 harvest got an average of 12.8 centners per jeongbo). In two years the KWP CC and DPRK government have done much work to expand the planting of corn at the expense of low-yielding cereal crops (barley and others). An indicator that corn is being taken by peasants as highest-yielding and profitable is the fact that individual sectors near farmhouses have as a rule been planted with corn.Kim Il Sung noted that in the current year corn actually saved the situation and, in spite of the drought, the gross grain crop is expected to be no less than 3-3.1 million tons (in 1956 it was 2.87 million tons). Here Kim Il Sung said that a big role in the sharp increase of the corn crops (corn crops doubled in the past two years and as of this July 1st corn was planted on 194,000 hectares more than on this date in 1956) was played by the Soviet experience of a massive introduction of corn crops and Krzhizhanovsky's letter to V. I. Lenin, a copy of which was passed to him by Ambassador Ivanov in 1955.I again directed Kim Il Sung's attention to the need to use considerable areas of corn for silage in milk-wax ripeness even in the current year since when this is done two or three thousand feed units more will be collected per jeongbo, which will provide an opportunity to get a considerable amount of pork and milk.Kim Il Sung agreed with the views [I] expressed and said that next winter they are organizing special training of managerial personnel to get higher corn harvests and a harvest of considerable areas in milk-wax ripeness.I also shared the Soviet experience in cultivating hybrid corn seeds and about the value of such seeds for getting high harvest yields.Kim Il Sung noted that they will need to get higher-yielding varieties of corn from the USSR and Bulgaria and organize the development of hybrid seeds of corn on the fields of each province's state farms.Concerning timber harvests in the USSR for the DPRK. Kim Il Sung was very grateful for the Soviet government's decision to permit the harvesting of timber in the USSR for the DPRK using Korean workers and the Soviet side's furnishing machinery, specialists, and living space, noting that the harvesting conditions are not only acceptable but advantageous to the DPRK.The most stressful thing for us in the draft five-year plan, said Kim Il Sung, is the shortage of timber, and therefore without the aid of the Soviet Union we would not have overcome these difficulties.Concerning the situation in South Korea. We exchanged opinions about the economic and political situation in South Korea, about the Americans' desire for an actual occupation of South Korea for an indefinite time, and about the lopsided colonial development of the South Korean economy. Kim Il Sung reported that on 31 July of this year he will interrupt his vacation for several days and go to Pyongyang to meet with voters on 2 August and then consider a number of pressing matters about the CC and DPRK government.x x xIn conversations which were held Nam Il reported that Kim Il Sung had to interrupt the vacation not just to meet with voters but also to consider a number of pressing matters associated with the statements of several people who had been arrested who were closely connected with the leadership of the anti-Party group. However, Nam Il did not report any information about the nature of the statements.Speaking of the composition of the future Cabinet of Ministers, Nam Il said that this issue has not yet been officially discussed in the Presidium. They are unofficially thinking about the most suitable and advisable alternatives in order to preclude the promotion of Choe Yong-geon [Choe Yong Gon] to the post of premier, as was intended last year. At this point Nam Il asked me if I am thinking of talking with Kim Il Sung on this subject.I said that I do not consider it necessary at the present time to raise these issues with Kim Il Sung at my own initiative.Nam Il noted that evidently Kim Il Sung will inform you about this issue.[…]SOVIET AMBASSADOR IN THE DPRK[signature] (A.

Khr. 85?7]JOURNAL of Soviet Ambassador in the DPRK A. M. PUZANOV for the period13 through 28 June 1960Pyongyang[…]16 June 1960After familiarization with the information of Cde. P. F. Yudin about the conversation with Mao Zedong (the conversation was held on 30 November 1956), Cde. F. R. Kozlov presented it to me and instructed [me] to familiarize Kim Il Sung alone with it personally.I visited Kim Il Sung at a guest house and said that I have instructions to familiarize him with a single document, adding that this could be done after Kim Il Sung inspected the exhibit of the wreckage of the downed American aircraft to which he planned to go; Kim Il Sung expressed a desire that I immediately familiarize him with this document.I read Kim Il Sung Cde. P. F. Yudin's information about Mao Zedong's conversation with him concerning the question of Kim Il Sung (the conversation was held on 30 November 1956).Kim Il Sung was extremely indignant at Mao Zedong's statements. In the course of reading the information he said several times, \"This is a lie. This didn't happen. How could Mao Zedong not only say but even think such a thing about me\", etc. Kim Il Sung was very disturbed and at first was even taken aback and sat silent for some time, and smoked unusually much. It was the first time I have had occasion to observe Kim Il Sung in such a condition. Usually it is hard to upset his equilibrium. Outwardly, he always remains calm. Then, Kim Il Sung repeated to me in detail the history of the formation of the anti-Party factional group of Choe Chang-ik and the others in the KWP in the summer of 1956, of the comradely advice given the delegation while in Moscow in June 1956, of the CPSU CC telegram about the anti-Party group (Kim Il Sung said that this CPSU CC telegram supported him), about the visit to Pyongyang by Peng Dehuai and A. I. Mikoyan in September 1956, about the apologies and all sorts of statements by Mao Zedong in Moscow in the autumn of 1957, about Peng Dehuai's visit to him at the same time, etc. Kim Il Sung declared that he has always taken and will firmly take Marxist-Leninist positions. During the Hungarian events, he noted, the KWP stirred the entire Korean people to the support of the measures of the Soviet Union and declared that it has always supported and will continue to support all the measures of the CPSU and the Soviet Government. Kim Il Sung exclaimed, how could Mao Zedong not only say, but even think that I could be a traitor, that I could be in collusion with Syngman Rhee? This is an outright lie and slander! The Chinese leaders are behaving hypocritically: they say one thing to your face and another behind your back. The CPSU and Soviet Government leaders act entirely differently. Cde. N. S. Khrushchev speaks frankly to us about our shortcomings and mistakes in a Party-like, comradely manner. He vigorously and consistently supports the correct policy of the KWP CC and DPRK government.Kim Il Sung then asked if yesterday he had presented his position sufficiently clearly after Cde. F. R. Kozlov's information about the incorrect actions and factional activity of the Chinese leaders.I told Kim Il Sung because I always speak frankly and openly with him, in a Party-like manner, I will say that yesterday in the conversation with Cde. F. R. Kozlov, A. N. Kosygin, and A. I. Mikoyan he did not present his position clearly about this issue, saying only that the CPC and CPSU representatives ought to meet and examine contentious issues.Kim Il Sung exclaimed, but in fact the KWP CC has always supported and does support the CPSU CC line on all of the most important issues. We have acted that way in the past as we are acting now, as we will act in the future!I told Kim Il Sung that we know that the KWP CC has always supported the position of the CPSU on the most important issues, but inasmuch at the present time the subject is about the incorrect factional actions of the Chinese leaders and their mistaken views about a number of important issues, it is obvious that it is advisable to speak clearly about one's own position, the KWP position on these issues.Kim Il Sung said that he will speak about this frankly and vigorously tomorrow during the meeting with Cde. N. S. Khrushchev.In the evening I informed Kim Il Sung that Cde. N. S. Khrushchev will receive him tomorrow at 1100.[...]USSR AMBASSADOR IN THE DPRK\t\t\t\t\t[signature]\t(A.

I dwelt on the most important issues raised in the report of Cde. N. S. Khrushchev and also about the prospects for the harvest and the successful operation of industry in the USSR.Kim Il Sung thanked [me] for the information.Further in the conversation opinions were exchanges about foreign policy issues: the convening of a conference at a high level, the state of affairs in France, the events in Lebanon, concerning Yugoslavia, etc. Kim Il Sung reported that by decision of the CC Presidium he would go on vacation and rest at the dacha in the area of the Suphung Hydroelectric Station beginning 28 June. Kim Il Sung said that if there are any questions for me please come to the dacha at any time that I am vacationing.I informed Kim Il Sung that the USSR MFA offered me leave in July. Evidently I will be leaving for Moscow on 7 July.Kim Il Sung reported that Pak Geum-cheol will chair the CC Presidium during his absence and Kim Il [will chair] meetings in the Cabinet of Ministers. Pak Jeong-ae will go to the SED congress with a delegation on 4 July. Kim Chang-man still has not returned from Czechoslovakia.I thanked Kim Il Sung for the information.I passed along a request of Cde.

M. PUZANOVfor the period 6 through 29 May 1957Pyongyang[…]28 May 1957I visited Nam Il and told him that in connection with statements of American official circles and press for reinforcement and rearmament of the American and South Korea troops in South Korea which have recently taken place and, in particular, for the delivery of new models of weapons to South Korea, in Moscow they think that it would be advisable for the DPRK MFA to make an appropriate statement.Nam Il expressed his complete agreement with the substance of the suggestions described in the USSR MFA telegram and stated that the DPRK MFA is preparing an appropriate statement which will be published in two or three days. Nam Il also reported that on 27 May a similar desire was expressed to him by the Chinese Ambassador, who referred to the corresponding exchange of opinions between the USSR and PRC on this issue and that this desire was met with approval by the DPRK leadership.In the conversation which took place Nam Il said that the Americans are making insistent attempts and evidently in the near future the issue will be raised in the Military Armistice Commission about changing Article 13 of the Armistice Agreement. This change, in his opinion, should be that the delivery of new weapons is permitted.Nam Il said in this regard that there are two points of view on this issue.One of them, which Jeong Gwang-rok, the DPRK representative to the Military [Armistice] Commission expressed, is to try to come to agreement with the Americans and other Commission members about some change in this article. This was motivated by the fact that, inasmuch as there are armies in South Korea and South Korea, these armies should also be armed with modern weapons.Another point of view, Nam Il's, is to object to the American proposal about a change to Article 13 of the Armistice Agreement because permission for the delivery of new weapons will lead to a further aggravation of the situation and complicate turning the armistice into a lasting peace, and complicate work to unify North and South Korea on a democratic basis. Nam Il then said that in the opinion of General Jeong Gwang-rok the representatives of Poland and Czechoslovakia in the Neutral Commission reportedly are of such a point of view. He, Nam Il, suggested that General Jeong Gwang-rok think over his point of view again and has not yet submitted the issue to the MFA collegium for discussion. This issue has also not been discussed in the KWP CC Presidium.In return, I told Nam Il that the American proposal about a change to Article 13 of the [Armistice] Agreement pursues the goals of legalizing what they are doing contrary to the Armistice Agreement, illegally delivering weapons to South Korea and promoting the growth of the South Korean army. The real goals of the Americans are directed at undermining the armistice in Korea, at creating a tense situation like they are doing in other parts of the world, and that they want to prolong an actual occupation of South Korea by the American armed forces. Therefore the task of the DPRK and PRC in the Military [Armistice] Commission and also the Polish and Czechoslovak representatives in the Neutral Commission is to expose and categorically reject such and similar American proposals. Nam Il completely agreed with this.Nam Il asks to pass to the CPSU CC and Soviet government a KWP CC and DPRK government request to agree to an unofficial visit to Moscow in the middle of June by Kim Il, KWP CC Presidium member and Deputy Chairman of the Cabinet of Ministers, and Gosplan chairman Ri Jeong-ok with a group of officials for consultation and economic coordination of the DPRK's draft first five-year plan for 1957-1961. If agreed the Korean friends would like to travel to Moscow on 15 June. Nam Il then reported that on 6 May Kim Il Sung asked the Chinese ambassador in the DPRK to pass to the PRC government a request to receive a group of Korean officials for consultation and economic coordination of the DPRK's draft five-year plan. Today the Chinese ambassador reported to the Korean friends that the PRC government approves the proposals about consultation and economic coordination of the DPRK's draft five-year plan; however, it will not be able to receive the Korean comrades in June since a session of the National Congress of People's Representatives will be held in the PRC during this time. The Chinese friends agreed to hold these consultations in July.I said that this request will be sent on immediately.x x xI received PNR Ambassador Cde. Siedlecki.Siedlecki reported that he had received the following telegram from the PNR MFA:\"In a conversation with our envoy in Berne the Swedish ambassador noted that the Americans complain in connection with one of the points (note: the translation is not accurate; evidently one should read not \"of the points\" but \"with an article\") of the Armistice [Agreement] which hinders them from modernizing equipment [snaryazhenie] for South Korea and repairing old equipment. Special spare parts factories for equipment located there built by the Americans in South Korea cost a great deal and are uneconomical. As is apparent from the discussion and also from other signals, the Americans are putting pressure on the Swedes and Swiss with the goal of achieving a further weakening of the Armistice rules\" (rewritten from a text passed me by the Ambassador).In addition, Siedlecki reported that he had received this telegram from Brzestowski, the Polish representative in the Neutral Commission.\"Wan Li, the Chinese representative in the Neutral Commission, said that according to unconfirmed information a conference of member countries of the UN command is taking place in Washington and that the issue of the introduction of new weapons will be placed for discussion at Panmunjeom on 1 July of this year\" (written down from text handed [me]).In reply to my question whether the Ambassador knew what point of view Polish representative Brzestowski has on the issue of the delivery of new weapons to South Korea and accordingly on the issue of a change to Article 13 of the Armistice Agreement, Siedlecki noted that Brzestowski is not subordinate to him in his work as Ambassador but that the Polish MFA and Brzestowski himself sometimes inform him about the most important issues. But he does not know Brzestowski's point of view on the issues under discussion. However, he added that Brzestowski reported that the point of view of General Jeong Gwang-rok, the DPRK representative, is negative, that is, he is against a change of Article 13 of the Armistice Agreement (as is known from the information of Nam Il, General Jeong Gwang-rok has expressed another point of view. See the record of the 27 May conversation about this issue).Siedlecki then said that he was at the DPRK MFA on this issue at Deputy Foreign Minister Ri Dong-yong's and at Chinese Ambassador Qiao Xiaoguang's. Ri Dong-yong told him that they exchanged opinions in connection with the statements which have occurred in favor of delivering new weapons to South Korea and came to the conclusion that a number of articles and materials ought to be published in the Korean press on this issue exposing the real goals of the Americans. Such materials are already being published. Then, an appropriate statement ought to be issued.I informed Siedlecki that today I was at Nam Il's about issues associated with the arrival of a Soviet parliamentary delegation and that in the conversation that was held Nam Il reported the intention to publish a DPRK MFA statement in the next few days in connection with the statements the Americans have made about the delivery of new weapons.Informing me about his conversation with the Chinese ambassador, Siedlecki said that the Chinese ambassador said that it was difficult for DPRK representatives to object to the Americans' proposal about delivering new weapons inasmuch as jet aircraft have been delivered to North Korea and his, Siedlecki's, opinion is the same.In reply to my question why they see difficulty in this when jet aircraft from American forces and Korean-Chinese forces participated during the war and consequently about what delivery of jet aircraft could the Americans raise a question, I somewhat puzzled the Ambassador and he said that this was actually so and then all these fears are not understandable.Siedlecki also reported that they had received a message about the impending replacement of the Polish representative in the Neutral Commission and his deputy connection with the expiration of their two-year term, and that during the replacement the need for these representatives to have corresponding military ranks will be taken into consideration.At the end of the conversation Siedlecki said that his two daughters are studying in our Soviet school at the Embassy and that the older daughter is friends with the daughter of GUEhS [Main Directorate for Economic Relations] representative Karev. They are inviting Siedlecki's daughter to Moscow in connection with school holidays and the departure on leave of the Karevs. The Ambassador said that under the influence of the daughter's and wife's request he agreed and asked that there be no remarks [zamechaniya] from me. I said that there cannot be any comments and that I have none. It is very good that the Karevs invited his daughter to spend some time with them in Moscow, all the more so as I know the older daughter of the Ambassador was born in Moscow during the war.Siedlecki expressed gratitude…[…]SOVIET AMBASSADOR IN THE DPRK[signature]   (A.

Tor[benkov]30 December][illegible signature;30 December 1957]Pyongyang26 November 1957I received GDR Ambassador Fischer at his request and had a conversation with him.At the beginning of the conversation Cde. Fischer asked my opinion about a meeting of ambassadors concerning the issue of contacts not only among ambassadors but also among other embassy officials.Supporting the need to expand contacts among other embassy officials I expressed doubt about convening of a special meeting of ambassadors to discuss this issue. I suggested exchanging opinions with the ambassadors without calling a special meeting on this issue.Cde. Fischer completely agreed with the opinion I expressed.At Cde. Fischer's request I told about the Soviet Union's fulfillment of its obligations to give free economic aid to the DPRK as of 1 October 1957.Responding to Cde. Fischer's question, I told about the terms of the Soviet-Korean agreement about the Korean side's purchase of wood in the area of Komsomol'sk.Then Cde. Fischer asked if there is any agreement about the Soviet Union giving aid to the DPRK in the organization of catching fish in the winter with the aid of Soviet ships.I replied that no such agreement had been concluded between the two countries.At the end of the conversation Cde. Fischer said that during the visit to Cde. N. S. Khrushchev Cde. Kim Il Sung had declared the intention of the Korean Worker's Party and the Korean government to bring the production of cotton and silk fiber to 17 meters per capita by the end of the five-year plan. Special importance is being attached to increasing the production of rayon fabric. I asked Cde. Fischer in passing if he knew anything about the results of the visit to the GDR by the Korean specialist in the area of rayon production equipment.Cde. Fischer replied that he did not yet know of any results from this trip  and that he only knows that three such specialists were in the GDR, including two this year and one as part of a Korean government delegation. Cde. Fischer promised to clear up this question with his trade representative and report at the next meeting. At the same time Cde. Fischer reported that at the present time talks are being held between the leader of a group of GDR specialists in the city of Hamhung and the Korean side about further construction plans of the city of Hamhung. The ambassador promised to inform me of the results of the talks.The conversation was translated by GDR Embassy interpreter Richard [Binert].Embassy Attaché M. Kurbatsky was present at the conversation.[…]I participated in a reception at the Czechoslovak Embassy on the occasion of the visit of a parliamentary delegation and a delegation of the city of Prague.Nam Il reported that today he received a Japanese delegation of representatives of the Japanese-Korean Friendship Society. Then Nam Il reported that he had received a collection of articles, \"The October Revolution and the National Liberation Movement in the Countries of Asia and the Orient\", published for the 40th anniversary of Great October by the CPSU CC Academy of Social Sciences. An article by Kim Seung-hwa, \"The October Revolution and the National Liberation Movement in Korea\" was published in this collection. Nam Il said, we do not understand why the article of Kim Seung-hwa was published inasmuch as he is a participant of the anti-Party group which acted [vystupivshaya] last year on the eve of the August CC Plenum.I told Nam Il that I knew nothing about the collection and that I am hearing about the collection from him for the first time. However, it is not completely clear, why does the appearance of an article by Kim Seung-hwa surprise you? Kim Seung-hwa was sent to study at the Academy of Social Sciences by the KWP CC, he is a member of the KWP CC, and no KWP CC decisions about his anti-Party activity are yet known.Nam Il replied to this question that, as far as he knows, the secretary of the Embassy Party organization in Moscow was at the secretary of the Party organization of the Academy and told about the undesirability of the appearance of an article by Kim Seung-hwa in this collection.Inasmuch this was about Kim Seung-hwa I asked Nam Il, what are the facts of the traitorous activity of Kim Seung-hwa in construction inasmuch as he was given such a characterization in the report by Pak Geum-cheol, but no facts and evidence were cited?Nam Il limited himself to a general argument, but also cited no facts.I noted that I did not at all understand that on the one hand Kim Il Sung expresses an opinion that Kim Seung-hwa stay in the Soviet Union and not return to the DPRK, and on the other that both in the press and at the Plenum he is described as a vile traitor to the revolution.Nam Il replied that evidently the issue of Kim Seung-hwa's not returning to the DPRK is being dropped.Nam Il asked my opinion about the advisability of convening the ambassadors for information about the results of the KWP CC Plenum inasmuch as a report by Pak Geum-cheol about an improvement in capital construction was published in the newspapers.I replied to Nam Il that only one report was published in the press but the decision about an improvement in capital construction has not been published. The Plenum's decision about organizational issues was also not published. In my opinion convening the ambassadors to [provide] information is advisable.Nam Il agreed.26 November 1957I visited Nam Il at his invitation. Nam Il informed [me] that the KWP CC Presidium had heard Kim Il Sung's report about the trip of the Party-government delegation to Moscow for the celebration of the 40th anniversary of Great October and had approved the work done by the delegation. All Presidium members were completely satisfied and very content with the results of the meetings of the delegation leadership, especially the meetings with Cdes. N. S. Khrushchev and Mao Zedong. The Presidium decided to convene a KWP CC Plenum on 5 December at which Kim Il Sung's report about the results of the trip, the results of the conferences held in Moscow, and the Declaration and the Peace Manifesto which were adopted will be heard. [The following] are being invited to the Plenum: ministers and other senior officials of national agencies, the chairmen of provincial and district Party committees and people's committees, and also all our ambassadors abroad. An expanded meeting of the YeDOF and a session of the Supreme People's Assembly will be held after the Plenum.The issue of the time of arrival in the DPRK of a Chinese government delegation headed by Zhou Enlai is being tentatively examined. The Presidium came to the conclusion that the most convenient time will be April-May.The Party conference will evidently be held in February of next year.In reply to my question of when Kim Il Sung plans to visit China and North Vietnam, Nam Il said that it will apparently be in October-November 1958.On behalf of Kim Il Sung Nam Il delivered a lunch invitation for 29 November to me, Counsellors Kryukov, and Shesterikov, Military Attaché D'yakonov, and MFA official Torbenkov in connection with the return of the Party-government delegation from Moscow. He then asked who else ought to be invited.I advised inviting Deputy GKEhS Representative Botsin, and Nam Il agreed.In the conversation with me Nam Il reported in strict confidence that during two meetings in Moscow between Kim Il Sung and Mao Zedong at which Kim Chang-man and he, Nam Il, were also present, much attention was devoted to Peng Dehuai's trip to the DPRK in September of last year (see my telegram Nº 655 of 27 November 1957).During the second conversation with Mao Zedong Kim Il Sung said that Peng Dehuai had come to his dacha and had a long conversation. Mao Zedong replied: it is good that Peng Dehuai went to you. He has not yet managed to report to me about the conversation with you. But I have to tell you that Peng Dehuai does not always speak the truth, and therefore not everything that Peng Dehuai says is the opinion of the CC. What he, Mao Zedong, says is the opinion of the CPC CC.Nam Il also reported that at the present time the MFA is preparing a letter about an invitation to a Soviet Party-government delegation to visit the DPRK in 1958. A letter is being prepared to the USSR Council of Ministers about the establishment of VCh communications. With regard to the annual delivery of 5,000 tons of cotton from the Soviet Union our delegation which is presently in Moscow has been charged with officially raising this issue in talks at the conclusion of the trade agreement. In accordance with the advice which was given in a conversation [by] Cde. N. S. Khrushchev I recommended that Nam Il also prepare an official letter from the DPRK Council of Ministers to the USSR Council of Ministers. Nam Il agreed.USSR AMBASSADOR IN THE DPRK\t\t\t[signature]\t(A. PUZANOV)Five copies printed1 - Gromyko2 - Fedorenko3 - Kurdyukov4 - Solodovnik5 - to fileNº 72828 November 1957gk\n",

PUZANOVfor the period 1 through 25 October 19571 October 1957I visited Kim Il Sung in accordance with MFA instruction Nº 1886/Ts dated 29 September, a telegram received on the night of 30 September-1 October.Having heard out the report I gave, Kim Il Sung said that the CPSU CC had decided well and correctly. The enemies ought not to be given an excuse to use this event in their propaganda.In the conversation which took place Kim Il Sung reported that the KWP CC Presidium and DPRK government have approved the composition of the Party-government delegation to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Great October in Moscow. The personnel composition of the delegation is as follows: Kim Il Sung (head of the delegation), Kim Chang-man, Nam Il, Pak Mun-gyu (Minister of State Control), and Ri Sin-pal (DPRK Ambassador in Moscow).Kim Il Sung said that they are going to Moscow with great eagerness and impatiently await the meetings with CPSU and Soviet government leaders. They very much want and hope for a meeting with CPSU CC First Secretary Cde. N. S. Khrushchev, Deputy USSR Council of Ministers Chairman Cde. A. I. Mikoyan, and USSR Minister of Defense Cde. G. K. Zhukov. Kim Il Sung said that we have not been in Moscow since July of 1956 and have not met with the Communist Party leaders in more than a year. Many questions have accumulated since that time. We would like to talk and consult with the CPSU leadership about issues of socialist development in the DPRK, about intra-Party issues, about issues of the country's defense in the event of attack, and about the reunification of North and South Korea.Kim Il Sung reported that the CC Presidium had decided to convene a KWP CC Plenum on 17 October at which the issue of construction would be heard. Pak Geum-cheol [Pak Kum Chol] was approved as the speaker.In reply to my question, would there be other issues at the Plenum, Kim Il Sung replied that no other issues are being submitted to the Plenum.Kim Du-bong spoke at the last CC Presidium meeting, as Kim Il Sung said. In Kim Il Sung's words, he asked that he be given an opportunity to speak self-critically about his position with regard to the factionalists before the August 1956 CC Plenum at the Presidium or at the KWP CC plenum. The Presidium decided to hear Kim Du-bong at its meeting before the KWP CC Plenum.I asked Kim Il Sung, how Kim Du-bong reacted to the CC Presidium not recommending him for re-election as Chairman of the VNS [Supreme People's Assembly] Presidium?Kim Il Sung replied that in a personal conversation with him Kim Du-bong admitted his guilt before the Party in connection with the actions of the factionalists before the August CC Plenum last year. In Kim Il Sung's words, Kim Du-bong said that after the he could not remain in such a high post and that he was ready to speak self-critically and will take any work that the CC determines.in a conversation with Kim Il Sung also at the last Presidium [meeting] Kim Du-bong asked that he be given a person to help him write what he plans to say at the CC Presidium. Kim Il Sung said, I said that Kim Du-bong can speak without notes; his speech at the Presidium will be recorded by a  stenographer and sent to him for correction. But inasmuch as Kim Du-bong insisted on his request, the Presidium assigned him a CC department chief.I informed Kim Il Sung that by a 14 September 1957 instruction the USSR Council of Ministers had granted the DPRK government's request for technical assistance in the repair of the Nampho seaport.Kim Il Sung thanked the Soviet government for the assistance given.Speaking of the progress of the investigation of the case of the anti-Party group of Choe Chang-ik, Pak Chang-ok, and others, Kim Il Sung declared that there would be no more arrests. Concerning the Party members who joined this anti-Party group, Party organizations are considering and taking steps through Party channels right now. We are not hurrying to finish the investigation in order to sort it out in detail and substance.At this point I tactfully noted that, considering the situation in the country, there are no reasons and circumstances producing a need to quickly finish this case, but as regards the foreign situation, then obviously the KWP CC considers it advisable to pursue the matter so as not to give the Americans and South Koreans any basis for propaganda toward their malicious ends.Kim Il Sung agreed with this comment.Kim Il Sung then reported that Kim Il is in the PRC and is concluding the talks associated with the draft of the DPRK five-year plan. The largest difficulties are being caused by the issue of deliveries of coke and cotton from the PRC. In this connection we decided to keep up to 60,000 hectares for cotton in 1958 and to plant cotton in feeding blocks since this year's experience shows that a high yield is obtained with such a means of planting. Then Kim Il Sung invited me to visit and see the cotton harvest in agricultural cooperatives for myself. I thanked [him] and said that I would avail myself of this invitation.Speaking of the production of textiles, Kim Il Sung said that they are also putting great pressure on the production of synthetic fiber. There is an agreement with the GDR about the delivery of part of the equipment for a factory to produce synthetic fiber from calcium carbide. At the present time our professor, who will visit the USSR on the way back to familiarize himself with the production of synthetic fiber at Soviet enterprises, is in the GDR about the issue of the production technology and the equipment.Kim Il Sung also reported that they have manufactured and successfully put into operation a small rolling mill by themselves.At the end of the conversation Kim Il Sung informed [me] that beginning on 2 October he will leave for the dacha in the area of the Suphung Hydroelectric Power Plant to continue the vacation interrupted in connection with the elections to the VNS.Nam Il was present at the conversation.The conversation lasted one hour…\n",

A. M. PUZANOVfrom 8 [SIC] through 14 October 1960 Pyongyang[…]5 October 1960I met with Pak Seong-cheol [Pak Song Chol] at his request.At the beginning of the conversation Pak Seong-cheol said that the public movement in South Korea advocating a peaceful reunification of Korea is expanding. As an example Pak Seong-cheol pointed to a meeting which was held recently by students of Korea University in Seoul. Many of those who spoke at this meeting favored the withdrawal of foreign troops from South Korea, the establishment of contact between the North and South of the country, the creation of a Committee of representatives of North and South Korea, and the holding of national elections in both parts of Korea under the supervision of observers from neutral countries. A National Committee to speed up the peaceful reunification of Korea was created at the meeting of students.Another example, Pak Seong-cheol continued, is the statement of representatives of the so-called \"Institute for the Study of the Korean Question\" in New York that after reunification Korea should become a neutral country not connected with either of the camps.In addition, said Pak Seong-cheol, at the present time there exist many other opinions and rumors in South Korea about the issue of peaceful reunification. Accordingly, we think that there is a need to again make a statement in our legislative body, the Supreme People's Assembly, about the peaceful reunification of the motherland. This statement will not contain anything new, it will only give concrete expression to Cde. Kim Il Sung's proposals about the creation of a confederation of the North and South and other steps concerning peaceful reunification.Then Pak Seong-cheol said that when drawing up the program for Cde. N. S. Khrushchev's visit to the DPRK a provision was made for his speech at a session of the Supreme People's Assembly on this issue. He continued, in connection with the situation developing in South Korea we plan to convene the session on 15 October but, not knowing when Cde. Khrushchev will be able to come to the DPRK, I would like to consult with you about this issue.I replied that the facts indicative of the public movement in South Korea for peaceful reunification about which Pak Seong-cheol spoke deserve attention. They say that the consistent and persistent policy of the KWP CC and the government of the republic directed at a peaceful solution of the Korean question are producing positive results. The new proposals of Cde. Kim Il Sung presented in his report devoted to the 15th anniversary of the liberation of Korea are attracting great attention from the population of South Korea and world public opinion. The Soviet government has a very high opinion of these proposals. Speaking at the 15th UN General Assembly session Cde. N. S. Khrushchev supported them completely as reasonable and meeting the national aspirations of the Korean people.I said that in connection with the sentiments in South Korea mentioned above there is also a clear need to discuss this issue in the DPRK legislative body in order to adopt the corresponding documents which would give concrete expression to Cde. Kim Il Sung's proposals about the peaceful reunification of the country. The question of when to convene the session of the Supreme People's Assembly should in my opinion be decided by the Korean friends themselves. Regarding the date of arrival in the DPRK of Cde. N. S. Khrushchev I still do not have any information concerning this matter. As everyone knows, at the present time Cde. N. S. Khrushchev and the other heads of state of the socialist camp are doing great and important work in the UN for peace throughout the entire world.I expressed my view that inasmuch as the suggestion for a speech by Cde. N. S. Khrushchev at a session of the Supreme People's Assembly was made by the KWP CC, then in the situation specifically unfolding right now [you] probably should act as the KWP CC considers necessary.After the views I stated above, Pak Seong-cheol said the following:\"The KWP CC intends to convene a session of the Supreme People's Assembly on 15 October. But we do not know whether Cde. N. S. Khrushchev will be able to take part in the session at this time and would like to consult with the CPSU CC: if Cde. N. S. Khrushchev will not be able to be in the DPRK at this time then should we not postpone the convening of the session until his arrival. The KWP CC will take the views expressed by the CPSU CC into consideration\".I replied that I will immediately send the above request to Moscow.Then, taking advantage of the occasion, I informed Pak Seong-cheol about the number and content of the welcoming letters and telegrams coming to the Embassy addressed to Cde. N. S. Khrushchev.Pak Seong-cheol noted that all these letters and telegrams are an expression of the feelings of eternal friendship and love for the Soviet people which the Korean people constantly carry in their hearts.Deputy Foreign Minister Kim Tae-hui took part in the conversation from the Korean side. Embassy Third Secretary D. A. Priyemsky was present at the conversation and interpreted.xxxI gave a return dinner for Chinese Ambassador Qiao Xiaoguang. The Ambassador and his wife, interpreter Li Wendai, and Embassy officials Counsellor V. I. Pelishenko and interpreter B. M. Morozov attended. It was notable that the Ambassador avoided holding a discussion on any political themes, which had not been previously observed. In particular, he did not react at all to the recent speech by N. S. Khrushchev at the 15th UN General Assembly session on the issue of the legal rights of the PRC at the UN.[…]SOVIET AMBASSADOR IN THE DPRK [signature]\t\t(A. Puzanov)Five copies sent re1 - Cde. A. A.

PUZANOVfrom 8 [SIC] through 14 October 1960 Pyongyang[…]8 October 1960I received GDR Ambassador Kurt Schneidewind at his request.The Ambassador provided information about the incorrect expressions of Albanian Ambassador Petro Gedeshi about the issue of the recall of the Soviet specialists from China which he made in a discussion on 7 October at the DPRK MFA (before the ambassadors' briefing). The Albanian Ambassador said that recently an official of the Albanian Embassy in Peking had come to them and told about the recall by the Soviet government of all its specialists in China. In Kurt Schneidewind's words, the Albanian Ambassador said the following on his own: the Soviet government is acting incorrectly: it helps India and Indonesia and at the same time recalls Soviet specialists from a fraternal socialist country, China. In reply to the comment of Kurt Schneidewind that evidently there are grounds for the recall of the Soviet specialists from China expressed in the incorrect behavior of the Chinese comrades themselves, Gedeshi replied that only the Soviet leaders had behaved incorrectly in this case.For his part Kurt Schneidewind express sharp dissatisfaction with the incorrect statements of the Albanian Ambassador.I thanked Kurt Schneidewind for the information.xxxI visited Kim Il Sung and passed him a CPSU CC Presidium letter on the issue of the visit to the DPRK by Cde. N. S. Khrushchev.I read the text of the letter and said on my own: Cde. N. S. Khrushchev wants very much to visit the DPRK. He always spoke to me about this when I was with him at receptions. Nikita Sergeyevich spoke about this to you during the last meeting on 17 June. The CPSU CC Presidium knows that the KWP leadership and DPRK government and the entire Korean people are awaiting the arrival of Cde. N. S. Khrushchev with great desire. More than 37,000 welcoming letters and telegrams have come to the Embassy suffused with warmth and great friendship for the Soviet people.Only circumstances which have developed with time caused the necessity of consulting with you about postponing the visit of Cde. N. S. Khrushchev.Kim Il Sung listened to the CPSU CC Presidium letter with great attention. It could be noted that the warmth and cordiality of the letter made a deep impression. After familiarization with the content of the letter Kim Il Sung said with some emotion: \"We well understand that Cde. N. S. Khrushchev is going enormous work in New York right now. This work has great importance and it cannot be interrupted. After return Cde. Khrushchev will have to deal with preparations for the Conference. So we fully understand all these circumstances which force the postponement of the time of the visit.We awaited the arrival of Cde. N. S. Khrushchev and carried out preparatory work. But this work will not be lost. This is necessary work. It was directed at strengthening the friendship and unity with the Soviet Union.It is advisable to publish a report in the press simultaneously about the postponement of the visit.It ought not to be consider awkward that it happed this way, the time of the visit is being postponed. We completely agree with the views of the CPSU CC. The most important thing is to make a contribution to a reduction of international tension. Right now it is more important than to visit Korea.A new time for the visit of Cde. N. S. Khrushchev to the DPRK can be arranged with him personally when meeting in November\".Then Kim Il Sung added in the form of question:This visit will hardly take place this year since it's cold here in winter. After visiting Korea Cde. N. S. Khrushchev wanted to go to Sakhalin and there, as we know, there is very much snow in winter. Therefore possibly the visit will take place in spring of next year?As regards the time of publication Kim Il Sung said 12 October. This time was named in connection with the fact that a festive meeting will take place on 10 October in connection with the 15th anniversary of the creation of the Korean Worker's Party and a report will be published on 11 October.With respect to the text of the report for the press Kim Il Sung said that after translation into Korean it will be considered and an appropriate opinion will be reported to the Embassy. (No changes to the text came. Only a title was suggested. The report was published in the Korean press on 12 October 1960).I thanked Kim Il Sung for the correct understanding and complete agreement with the ideas expressed in the CPSU CC Presidium letter.Minister Pak Seong-cheol was present at the conversation.The conversation was interpreted by Embassy Third Secretary D.

      " TOP SECRETSOVIET EMBASSY IN THE DPRKNº 163   Copy Nº 319 September 1960JOURNALof Soviet Ambassador in the DPRK A. M. Puzanov for the period24 August through 9 September 1960Pyongyang[…]7 September 1960I visited Kim Il Sung in the KWP CC at the instructions of Moscow. Present at the meeting were: Deputy Chairman of the KWP CC Kim Chang-man, Minister of Foreign Affairs Pak Seong-cheol, and Chief of the KWP CC International Department Pak Yong-guk. The conversation was interpreted by Embassy Third Secretary D. A. Priyemsky and DPRK MFA official Choe Won-sik (I was not informed of the issues of the meeting in advance).First. I told Kim Il sung that in Moscow they have closely examined the ideas of the Korean friends about the discussion of the Korean issue at the 15th UN General Assembly session described in the 9 July 1960 DPRK MFA Aide Memoire. The Soviet government expresses its complete agreement with the assessment given by the Korean friends that the current international situation and events in South Korea create a favorable situation for a vigorous denunciation of the aggressive policy of American imperialist with respect to Korea. Our government notes that the great economic and political successes of the DPRK considerably strengthen the position of the countries of the socialist camp on this issue.I reported that the Soviet delegation at the session will be given instructions to consider the DPRK MFA ideas described in the Aide Memoire during a discussion of the Korean issue in every possible way.The suggestion of the DPRK government about the creation of a Confederation of South and North Korea which was advanced in Cde. Kim Il Sung's 14 August report will occupy central place in the statement of the Soviet delegation about the Korean issue.The Soviet delegation will be charged with making a statement at the session about the inclusion in the session's agenda of a special point about the withdrawal of American troops from South Korea and the introduction of a corresponding draft resolution. However, I reported that if it turns out that the situation in the United Nations is not favorable for the introduction of such an issue or resolution and a rejection of our resolution might be used as an excuse to justify the further presence of American troops in Korea then the Soviet government expresses the idea that it would be advisable to refrain from this at this session.The Soviet delegation will also be charged with introducing a draft resolution about the immediate disbandment of the \"UN commission\" at a proper moment in accordance with the wishes of the Korean friends if the situation is such that this proposal might get considerable support from UN member countries. I provided information that the USSR MFA had given instructions to Soviet embassies in neutral countries to sound out and exert corresponding influence on the governments of these countries in order to try and enlist their support for our position on the Korean issue.As in past session the Soviet delegation will insist on the participation of DPRK representatives in the consideration of the Korean issue.I then familiarized Kim Il Sung with the basic positions of the Soviet delegation's statement at the 15th UN General Assembly session on the Korean issue and passed him the text of the basic positions with a request to express his ideas about it.Kim Il Sung and those present listened to the report and the basic positions very closely and with great interest and, as was evident from their reaction, greeted the report with satisfaction and agreement. Kim Il Sung said the following: \"We are deeply thankful to the Soviet government for the active support of our proposals. We completely agree with the basic positions of the Soviet delegation's statement for the 15th UN General Assembly session on the Korean issue. These are very good positions. We have no other thoughts, but we will carefully examine them again.Second. At the instructions of Moscow I told Kim Il Sung that the CPSU CC would consider it advisable to coordinate the issue of a single policy of the socialist countries with the KWP CC regarding the non-extension to West Berlin of the effect of the trade and economic agreement with the FRG and to describe to it those ideas which were made in Moscow's 5 September instructions.Kim Il Sung said: \"We completely agree with the CPSU CC idea which were expressed. Foreign trade officials will be given instructions to take these ideas into consideration\".Third. I informed Kim Il Sung that a stream of letters and telegrams has been coming to the Soviet Embassy in which DPRK workers welcome the upcoming visit of Cde. N. S. Khrushchev to the DPRK, express gratitude and invite him to visit their enterprises, agricultural cooperatives, and organizations. As of 6 September 1,629 such letters and telegrams have arrived, including 125 from collectives of industrial and transportation enterprises and construction organizations; 105 from agricultural collectives and state farms; 24 from leaders of provinces, cities, and districts; 42 from cultural, educational, artistic, scientific, and health organizations; 31 from other collectives, and 1,302 from individuals.Kim Il Sung said that the population heartily welcomes the upcoming visit of Cde. N. S. Khrushchev to the DPRK and jokingly added that \"the possibility is not excluded that there will be hostile telegrams in connection with the fact that spies, saboteurs, and wreckers are being sent to our country\".I told Kim Il Sung that such a possibility is not excluded, but none have been noted among the letters and telegrams. If there are such, we will inform you about this.Fourth. I told Kim Il sung that yesterday, as acting dean of the diplomatic corps by agreement with the DPRK MFA I had to organize and hold an inspection of the newly-built stadium, the bridge over the Taedong, and the Okryugwan Restaurant by officials of the diplomatic corps. The officials of the diplomatic corps were happy at the great successes of the builders, who have mastered modern methods of construction, and are exultant at the successes of the fraternal Korean people.Fifth. I told Kim Il Sung that Embassy officials were familiarized with his speech in the province of South Hamgyong with great attention. I noted that the ideas expressed by him about the work of the Hungnam people's committee provoked great interest.For his part Kim Il Sung provided detailed information about the situation with the construction of a Vinalon production plant, a vinyl chloride production plant, and the state of affairs in agriculture in the province of South Hamgyong. At this point he said the following:\"Ri Jeong-ok and I, the chiefs of KWP CC departments, of Heavy Industry and Construction, and Gosplan Chairman Rim Gi-cheol[sic] spent about a week in the province of South Hamgyong. The mood of the workers and at the construction of the Vinalon and vinyl chloride plants is good. Right now we have enlisted one division of the People's Army in the construction of the Vinalon plant. The work is being done in three shifts. Three thousand people work in each shift. If the supply of the builders is well-organized then the construction will go well. The first phase of the construction will be done by May of next year. Ten thousand tons of Vinalon a year can be produced after the conclusion of the construction of the first stage. This yarn can be mixed with other synthetic fiber obtained from wood and good textiles produced. Right now Doctor of Technical Sciences Ri Seung-gi, the inventor of the means of producing vinyl chloride, is at the construction of the plant. The construction of the vinyl chloride production plant is being done there. After the end of construction the capacity of the plant will be 6,000 tons of vinyl chloride a year. The builders have taken a commitment to finish the construction of the plant by 15 October, by the 15th anniversary of the creation of the Korean Worker's Party. Construction is in full swing right now but obviously the shortage of housing will be felt by the workers in the winter. Therefore orders have been given to build 1,000 temporary apartments. In the future permanent comfortable dwellings will be built.Much work has been done in the province of South Hamgyong in the past year and a half to build irrigation structures. The new chairmen of the Party and people's committees of the province (they have been working a year and a half) gave orders that the first priority is to organize the construction of irrigation systems. At the present time 190 reservoirs and 400 other irrigation structures have been built. If these structures had not been built the province would have suffered badly from flooding since very heavy rain fell this year. According to an analysis by our scientists such rain falls once every 1000 years. However, there was no great damage in the province from floods or a typhoon. The peasants are expressing great joy that during the year and a half the KWP created structures allowing not only steadily high harvests to be obtained but also reliably protected against floods and typhoons. Then Kim Il Sung said that last year he recommended that the peasants in the village of [Khynsan] build an irrigation system. They listened to the advice and built an irrigation system by the beginning of this year's field work. If this system had not existed all the chibi would have been flooded and washed away by the water and all the crops in an area of more than 1,000 jeongbo. Such structures were created not just in one district but in many others. Kim Il Sung said that a meeting of Party activists had been held. He noted, at the party activists' meeting we extolled the leadership for the good organization of the work and especially the Chairman of the provincial Party committee, Hyeon Mu-kwan [sic], who previously graduated from the Higher Party School in the Soviet Union. Industrial methods of construction are widely employed in the province. Much work is being done to cultivate vegetables for the population. The situation in agriculture is good. Last year it was an average of two and a half tons of grain better per labor day per household. This year prospects for the harvest in the province are better than last year. The population of the province is gripped with high political enthusiasm. Now the difference between the poor leadership in the past and the good leadership at the present time is very evident. In the past Chairman of the provincial Party committee Ri Yu-min, a factionalist from the Choe Chang-ik group, did not actually supervise agriculture. In the whole time he only went to the countryside once. Before, for example, the majority of the rice fields in the district of [Chanpkhyon] had uneven irrigation and the harvest was low, in the range of 1-1.5 tons. Now 85% of the rice fields are supplied with steady irrigation. Ten reservoirs have been built. Last year the harvest per jeongbo was 2.5 tons of rice. This year 3.5 tons is expected. When tractors and other machines are introduced the harvest will be still better.Kim Il Sung said that he had been at the [Chzhoyan] cooperative, which Cde. N. S. Khrushchev is to visit. The cooperative is large, it combines 1,050 farms. It is planned to gather 20 tons of apples per jeongbo in the cooperative. This year they expect to distribute 2.7 tons of grain and up to 500 won of money per household. Kim Il Sung said, next is another cooperative where the chairman is a woman, a deputy of the Supreme People's Assembly, and Hero of Labor. This cooperative is still richer. This woman's husband participated in the revolutionary movement and died. She herself actively works as chairman. This year it is proposed to distribute an average of 3.2 tons of grain per household.Kim Il Sung said, throughout the entire country the peasants have built many irrigation structures with the aid of state money. A total of up to 130,000,000 won of state credits have been released for these purposes. The KWP CC Presidium adopted a decision to release peasants from all debts for irrigation construction and credits received for cotton production. Kim Il Sung noted, we have an opportunity to do this since the Soviet Union released us from the payment of a large debt.Kim Il Sung then especially stressed that this year the Party is strictly holding to a policy of unconditional observation of the socialist principle of distributing income among the peasants. Right now an article is being prepared for publication in the press on the issue of the socialist principles of distribution. As this was stressed in a general Party meeting in [Chkhonsanri] this year early crops have already distributed on the basis of these principles: vegetables, wheat, and others, which has promoted an increase of the peasants' enthusiasm. Kim Il Sung stressed that not a single one of the aspects of the principle of material interest can be ignored, and also to combine this with conducting political educational work.On the whole, said Kim Il Sung, the results in the field of agriculture are good. The prospects for the harvest of rice, corn, and other crops is better than last year, although much more precipitation fell. By spring of next year 2,600 \"Chollima\" brand tractors should be produced at the [Kiyan] tractor plant and 1,000 low-power tractors.Sixth Kim Il Sung raised the issue of the upcoming visit to the DPRK by Cde. N. S. Khrushchev at his own initiative.Our people welcome the upcoming visit to the DPRK by Cde. N. S. Khrushchev with great enthusiasm, said Kim Il Sung. This visit will be new inspirational force for the Korean people in the construction of socialism and the struggle for the peaceful reunification of the motherland. In order to prepare to greet Cde. Khrushchev great explanatory work is being done in all provinces, for which a large number of propagandists have been sent. We expect a great political and industrial upsurge In connection with the visit to our country by Cde. N. S. Khrushchev. Kim Il Sung asked it be passed on that they will be very glad if Cde. Khrushchev can come to the DPRK together with [his] wife and other family members.Kim Il Sung said, the DPRK MFA has sent the plan for Cde. N. S. Khrushchev's visit to our country to the Embassy. But if Cde. N. S. Khrushchev cannot be in the DPRK for the time we desire then in this event we have given instructions to Minister Pak Seong-cheol to draw up a draft program calculated for a shorter timeframe.For my part I told Kim Il Sung that I sent the program for N. S. Khrushchev's visit to the DPRK received on 6 September, which was estimated for 9-10 days, to Moscow. We reported that you had specified a visit to the most important enterprises of various industrial sectors, two agricultural cooperatives, some structures of the largest [Anchzhun] irrigation system, and Pyongyang University. Of course, in Moscow the question might arise that Cde. N. S. Khrushchev cannot spend 9-10 days in the DPRK. Naturally, in this event the need will arise about drawing up a program calculate for a fewer number of days of the stay.Kim Il Sung said, the main attention of the session of the Supreme People's Assembly which it is proposed to convene during Cde. N. S. Khrushchev's stay in our country will be devoted to the peaceful reunification of Korea. At this time the 15th UN General Assembly will be occurring in New York which will discuss the Korean issue, and the recently-elected new government will be operating in South Korea. Having considered and discussed these circumstances and the international situation we are thinking of adopting at the session and officially sending a letter to the National Assembly of South Korea with a proposal about the creation of a Confederation of South and North Korea. In my report about the 15th anniversary of the liberation of Korea this proposal was described in general form, but specific proposals will be given in the planned letter. They will probably reject our proposals but it will their duty to us.In conclusion Kim Il Sung asked, if any questions connected with preparations for the arrival of Cde. N. S. Khrushchev arise, that I get in touch with Minister Pak Seong-cheol, who is charged by the KWP CC with carrying out all the preparatory work.The meeting and conversation lasted two hours.xxxI visited Jeong Il-yong, Deputy Chairman of the DPRK Cabinet of Ministers, at his request. At the beginning of the conversation Jeong Il-yong asked about the impression of the officials of the diplomatic corps from the inspection of the stadium, the restaurant, and the bridge and expressed gratitude for the attention displayed.I replied that these structure make a good impression and the officials of the diplomatic corps were happy at the successes of the workers of the capital.Jeong Il-yong expressed great satisfaction with the operation of the Soviet exhibition in Pyongyang which 713,000 people had visited in 20 days of operation. He said the exhibition is a remarkable school for the study of the experience of socialist development in the USSR.At the instructions of the KWP CC and DPRK government Jeong Il-yong asked that a wish and request be passed to the Soviet government to extend the time of operation of the Soviet exhibition in Pyongyang by 20-30 days, that is to 5-15 October of this year. During this time, said Jeong Il-yong, we would to like for specialists of industrial enterprises and senior industrial officials, transportation, and agriculture to engage in the study of the exhibits and expositions of the exhibition more deeply.I replied to Jeong Il-yong that I would report to Moscow about the wish and request he had expressed.Jeong Il-yong asked whether the Embassy had any comments about the work of the Korean comrades at the exhibition.I replied to Jeong Il-yong that I had been at the exhibition several times in recent days. I have no comments about the work of the Korean comrades. They all work conscientiously and carefully.I also said that recently a helicopter had been assembled at the exhibition and had flown over the city with visitors to the exhibition who wished to see their capital from above.I invited Jeong Il-yong and officials of the city people's committee to use the helicopter to inspect the city from above if they find it possible.Jeong Il-yong expressed gratitude for the invitation.Present at the conversation were: Pak Yong-geun [sic], Deputy Chairman of the Korean-Soviet Friendship Society (director of the Korean administration at the exhibition) and Embassy Third Secretary D. A. Priyemsky.[…]SOVIET AMBASSADOR IN THE DPRK [signature] (A. Puzanov)Five copies printed1 - Cde. A. A. Gromyko2 - Cde. Yu. V. Andropov3 - Cde. V. I.

      "Received by diplomatic pouch from Cde. Razuvayev, the Soviet Ambassador to the DPRK, 2 October 1951Top Secret[handwritten:] 10 September 1951[Handwritten:] f.45 op.7 d.347POLITICAL ATTITUDES AND KOREAN-CHINESE RELATIONS IN CONNECTION WITH THE ARMISTICE TALKSPolitical AttitudesThe proposal about armistice negotiations was greeted with some caution by the Korean leaders, without straightforward or outspoken statements.Although the majority of them understood the situation which has developed and agreed on the need for an armistice nevertheless the conclusion can be drawn from personal observation that the Korean leaders were depressed by the realization that the war which has ruined the country has not led to the unification of Korea and that now they have been forced to reconcile themselves to the restoration of the prewar status quo in considerably worse conditions.The statement of Cde. Malin was viewed by the Koreans as an expression of the evident desire of China to seek an armistice and free itself from the burden of aiding Korea. This desire was noted by Kim Il Sung with great disappointment as a result of a trip to [Beijing] in July. At the same time Kim Il Sung objectively evaluated China's strength, capabilities, and interests along with Korea's role in the overall struggle of the democratic camp. Warning of the desire of some comrades to ask for aid from the Soviet Union Kim Il Sung repeatedly spoke in the tone that the Soviet Union represents the main reserve of the democratic camp for which it is premature to enter the fight.The same ambivalence has also been observed in the attitudes of the broad circles of the Korean public. On the one hand, a general war fatigue and a desire to avoid further ordeals have been sensed. On the other, feelings of disappointment have become widespread that the armistice proposal was taken as a crushing of the hopes for final victory.The spread of similar attitudes has been promoted to a considerable degree by the fact that for several days after Cde. Malin's statement the North Korean press and other propaganda organs did not explain the significance of his proposal and did not comment on it at all. Only after the address of Ridgway and Kim Il Sung about the start of negotiations did the Korean press devote a number of articles to Cde. Malin's proposal, welcoming it, and until recently systematically covered the negotiations and the issues associated with it in the spirit of the above proposal.The Koreans have done much propaganda work around the negotiations, exposing the aggressive position of the Americans through the press and radio, inciting public opinion against them, and providing substantial support to the Chinese-Korean delegation at Kaesong. (We have not cited the response of the Korean press to the armistice negotiations inasmuch as they have been widely reproduced by the Soviet press).It ought to be pointed out that the attitudes against an armistice noted above turned out to be fluctuating and quickly changed in favor of ending the war. This was facilitated by many circumstances: the calamities endured by the population, general war fatigue, the wrecking of the economy, and an increase of American air raids, the prolonged lack of success at the front, the influence of democratic propaganda, etc. During the negotiations at Kaesong the Koreans have become accustomed to thinking of a possible end to the war and breakdowns in the negotiations are received by the Koreans with alarm and disappointment every time.In South Korea Malin's proposal was greeted with open hostility by the Syngman Rhee regime, which had cherished hopes that it would spread its authority to all Korea with help from the interventionists. The South Koreans organized protest demonstrations against the armistice negotiations. At the end of June the National Assembly of South Korea opposed ending the war at the 38th parallel.Although a representative of the South Korean army was included in the delegation to conduct negotiations at the instructions of the Americans the Syngman Rhee government did not stop opposing an armistice. On 31 July it organized a mass demonstration under the slogan, \"Unification or death!\". At the same time it undertook a number of diplomatic demarches in the same direction. For example, at a press conference on 10 August [Li An Muk], the South Korean envoy to London, spoke of his appeal to the British government:\"I request that the British government not try to establish a false peace in Korea. The real situation needs to be studied for this. A fierce war is unfolding in Korea right now and there cannot be talk of peace at this time\". [Li An Muk] declared that his government considers the disarmament of the Communists of North Korea necessary and for such a situation to be ensured through the UN in which third countries cannot give North Korea military, economic, or other aid.The hostile attitude of the South Koreans to the armistice negotiations is evidently explained not only by the fact that in an armistice they see the collapse of their plans to seize North Korea but also that their position completely suits the Americans. The latter, [to put] pressure on the Chinese-Korean side during the negotiations, second, to put pressure on their satellites who are insisting on an armistice and, third, to raise the [political] prestige of the South Koreans in the event of a collapse of the negotiations.Chinese-Korean RelationsDuring the entire history of the negotiations a difference can be observed in the approach to them by the Chinese and the Koreans.Recognizing the military and political necessity of concluding an armistice, Kim Il Sung and other Korean leaders considered it mandatory to hold negotiations in order not to damage the honor and undermine the prestige of the DPRK. The Chinese were inclined to make concessions to the Americans just to obtain an armistice agreement.When doing so the Chinese have not always strived to coordinate their position with the Koreans in a timely or tactful fashion, which has often caused the latter obvious irritation. For example, the Koreans sent to [Beijing] their draft reply to Ridgway's first speech, which was essentially little different than [Beijing]'s draft. The Chinese did not reply to the Korean draft but on the evening of 1 August they simply reported that the text of a reply from Kim Il Sung and Peng Dehaui cited in a telegram would be transmitted over [Beijing] Radio at a certain time and which should be simultaneously transmitted over Pyongyang Radio. Inasmuch as the telegram was sent late Pyongyang Radio broadcast [it] an hour later than [Beijing] [Radio], which was immediately noticed by American propaganda. Naturally, Kim Il Sung was upset about such a method of cooperation.[Beijing] sent to Kaesong a large group of diplomatic and military officials headed by [Li Kuo Nyn]*, a Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs and head of the CPC CC Department of Information. This group also included Chao, deputy chairman of a government commission on foreign affairs (Zhou Enlai is the chairman). The Chinese warned the Koreans that, besides instructions from above, their representatives should also be guided the decisions of the joint working meetings of the Chinese and Korean representatives which would be held daily under the chairmanship of [Li Kuo Nyn]. Later, Nam Il complained that he differed on a number of issues with Li, who displayed excessive amenability and compliancy with regard to the Americans.* The writing of the Chinese names is possibly inaccurate.Li drew up draft replies to both Joy's speeches as well as Ridgway's statements. However, not all of his drafts were approved by Mao Zedong, especially recently. At the end of August Mao Zedong rebuked Li in connection with the fact that in his formulation of a position he was making the Chinese interest in ending the war too obvious to the Americans and as a consequence this reduced the hope of success in the negotiations.In connection with the 12 July incident (the issue of not allowing foreign correspondents into Kaesong and the reconsideration of the agreement about the neutral zone) Kim Il Sung prepared his own reply to Ridgway in which he simultaneously exposed the baselessness of the accusations raised by the Americans, while meeting Ridgway's insistence halfway. However, the Chinese, without asking the opinion of Kim Il Sung, simply informed him of the text of Ridgway's reply [SIC, otvet Ridzhuehya; should be otvet Ridzhuehyu, \"to Ridgway\"] for transmission via Pyongyang Radio at a certain time. The Chinese reply did not satisfy Kim Il Sung inasmuch as it lacked criticism of Ridgway's purely propagandistic statement. The incident essentially was explained not as a violation of the agreement between liaison officers by the Americans, but simply as lack of agreement and Ridgway's demands were accepted as justified and well-founded. However, Kim Il Sung was deprived of an opportunity to express his opinion.On 27 May Mao Zedong informed Kim Il Sung that if the Americans insist on recognizing the current front line as the demarcation line the Chinese consider it possible to make the concession to the Americans. Mao Zedong asked Kim Il Sung to report his opinion about this question. Kim Il Sung replied to Mao Zedong immediately that he considers such a tactic impossible because it would mean a serious political blow to the DPRK and also because the regions of North Korea occupied by the Americans have great economic and strategic value.After Kim Il Sung's reply to Mao Zedong, frustrated, he declared in a conversation with Pak Heonyeong, \"I would sooner agree to continue the war without Chinese aid than to make such a concession. It makes no difference, we don't need such a Korea\". Evidently, this reply was not casual. It was an expression not only of national sentiments but also of certain political calculations. Kim Il Sung is not inclined to seek an armistice through concessions which undermine the prestige of the DPRK, hoping that in the final account China and the Soviet Union will not allow the DPRK to be defeated.After the American representatives made an excessive demand about the establishment of a demarcation line in the rear of the people's forces [narodnye voyska], on 28 July Mao Zedong sent Kim Il Sung a telegram in which he recommended the American proposal be categorically rejected, to word it strongly, and to remind them that their supremacy at sea and in the air did not prevent the KNA troops from being in the area of Taegu and twice south of Seoul. Mao Zedong's telegram was greeted by Kim Il Sung with great enthusiasm.The decisive position of the Chinese with respect to recent American provocations in the region of the negotiations also lifted the Koreans' mood.Nevertheless, it needs to be noted that recent months have brought a cooling in relations between the Koreans and the Chinese and a further strengthening of the Koreans' orientation toward the Soviet Union. The retreat from Suwon to the 38th parallel at a moment when the Americans were already preparing for an evacuation from Korea, the abandonment of large offensive operations, the constant references to the unpreparedness of the troops for an offensive, the clear desire to end the war at the 38th parallel, all this seriously undermined the authority of the Chinese in the eyes of the Korean leaders, although the latter realize what difficulties China encounters.The failure in negotiations only strengthens these attitudes. The Korean leaders think, first, that thanks to the Chinese the intentions of the Chinese-Korean side and its interest in peace were too fully identified during the negotiations. All the proposals were described in final form at the very start of the negotiations, which deprived [them] of an opportunity for further bargaining and mutual concessions. Second, Kim Il Sung and Pak Heonyeong are cautiously expressing the opinion that [Beijing] is pursuing an inconsistent policy. All this, in the opinion of the Koreans, explains the uncompromising position of the Americans and their desire to impose the shameful conditions of an armistice.At the present time a desire is being observed among the Korean friends to possibly achieve an armistice more rapidly.USSR AMBASSADOR in KOREA10 September 1951 V.

TO COMRADE FYN SI [STALIN]Having familiarized myself with the predicament of the KPA, I report:The situation of the People's Army troops on the Western (Seoul) and South-eastern (Busan [Pusan]) fronts is severe.Seeking to encircle and destroy the main forces of the People's Army, it is in the general direction of Chungju that the U.S. troops have concentrated the major efforts of the assault group which had landed in the area of Chemulpo [Incheon], as well as of the troops that had launched an offensive from the area to the North and Northwest of Daegu [Taegu].Using the support of the air force which has dominated the air space without hindrance and caused aircraft-fright [aviaboiazn'] both among the ranks within the People's Army and in the rear areas, the U.S. troops have managed to move from Suwon eastward and southeastward for 25 to 30 kilometers and some of their troops took over Sangju and Andong to the north and northwest of Daegu.According to the information which still needs to be verified, some tank units of the enemy's Seoul group continue to advance toward Chungju, which creates the danger of encirclement of the First Army Group of the KPA.The People's Army troops, suffering heavy losses, mainly from the enemy's airforce, having lost almost all their tanks and much artillery, are engaged in difficult battles to hold their positions. The troops lack ammunition and fuel the delivery of which has been virtually halted. The accounting for the available weapons and ammunition is organized unsatisfactorily. The top-down command and control system is set up poorly. The wire and radio communications work intermittently because of the interruptions inflicted by the enemy's air raids and due to the lack of qualified radio operators and the lack of fuel for radio station generators correspondingly. Courier mail is almost nonexistent. The predicament of the KPA troops, in particular on the Southeastern front, remains unclear.Upon our recommendation, on the night of 26.9.50 [26 September 1950], some Korean communications officers were dispatched to the Front Command and the Seoul group in order to collect information on the troops' situation.On 25.9.50, at 19:00 pm, local time, Kim Il Sung's order was forwarded to the troops, according to which the Seoul grouping and the Second Army Group operating in the northern part of the southeastern front were told to go on the defensive and hold up the enemy by any means.The troops of the Second Army Group operating in the central and southern parts of the southeastern front were ordered to begin general retreat northwestward with the aim of getting to the area of Chuncheon [Chunchon], Jecheon [Chechon], Wonju for further leveling off the front line approximately following the line Seoul, Yeosu [Yosu], Chungju, Naju, Uljin.On 26.9.50, KIM IL SUNG received our group.The meeting was also attended by Foreign Minister PAK HEON-YEONG [Pak Hon Yong] and Comrade SHTYKOV.As a result of our conversation, KIM IL SUNG decided to combine the duties of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief and Defense Minister in his hands, to set up a Staff Office for the Supreme Commander-in-Chief for the command and control over troops, and to pay serious attention to the work of the rear.At present, they have begun to form only six infantry divisions in the northern part of Korea, whereas the current military situation has made impossible the formation of nine infantry divisions manned with the Southerners.KIM IL SUNG issued a directive to take immediate steps aimed at withdrawing the remaining KPA troops from South Korea so that to use it to form new divisions in North Korea and deny this opportunity to the South.In connection with the fact that the Chinese railroads are overloaded transporting supplies to Korea, it is desirable that the armaments designated for use by the six divisions which are being newly formed be shipped first, and only then should the ammunition be delivered.After our conversation with KIM IL SUNG we got down to work in order to assist in:- organizing good command and control over troops;- rearranging the system of troop supplies, shipments, and transport services;- preparing defensive fortifications.The People's Army is experiencing a dire shortage of drivers. The 3,400 trucks which are to arrive soon have no drivers at all. It may be expedient to propose to Kim Il Sung that he ask the Chinese friends to dispatch not less than 1,500 drivers to Korea, may it not?

The Chinese delegation attending the Congress was led by Li Xiannian, the CPC (Communist Party of China) Central Committee’s Vice Chairman. The colleagues of the local Korean embassy expressed their satisfaction during conversations about the rank of the Chinese delegation. (The Chinese press mentioned the other delegations only as a sum of their numbers, it did not talk about their ranks.) Hua Guofeng, the Chairman of the CPC Central Committee greeted Kim Il Sung in a lengthy, warm telegram on the occasion of the 35th anniversary of the foundation of the KWP, and its 6th Congress. The communication organizations published and broadcasted a number of materials on Korea as an introduction to the congress, already before its actual opening, and the congress materials themselves were discussed in detail.From the Chinese point of view about the congress, they clearly expressed their support to Kim Il Sung in the published materials, as the leader of the party and the state, and commended him for his merits in detail. If we take into account the personnel changes that are currently occurring and recently occurred in China, and the arguments for them, it is highly plausible that the articles in the Chinese press published before the congress that stood up against, condemned, and judged the succession of power as a vestige of feudalism were not only directed at internal affairs. But they wanted to countervail the previously widely known rumors or possible concrete notions about Kim Il Sung’s transfer of power. It was apparent from the Chinese side’s clear approval of reelecting Kim Il Sung, and the detailed coverage about it in the press, that the appointment of a new leader with possible new concepts would have been highly undesirable by Chinese leadership in the current circumstances. It is also a sensitive issue for the Chinese leadership, because the dispute about the transfer of power is still unresolved in China. They still see a guarantee in Kim Il Sung’s person for maintaining the status quo on the Korean Peninsula.In Hua’s greeting to Kim Il Sung, they described the KWP as a party that excellently applies the teachings of Marxism–Leninism to the circumstances of Korea. On the other hand, Chinese materials have not mentioned anywhere the officially proclaimed ideology of the KWP, the “juche”. Its appreciation was left to the Korean materials that were published anyway. The Chinese leadership was not willing to go as far as putting the Korean ideology on a pedestal too.Druing his speech in Korea, Li Xiannian – as all other published Chinese materials – also assured the Korean leadership of China’s full support for the new, ten-point reunification plan that the Korean leadership announced during the congress.Li Xiannian labelled the ideas for the unification of the country as the “most realistic” plans so far. In order to emphasize the support of the Chinese side, Li Xiannian demanded the withdrawal of the American forces using the adjectives of “immediate and unconditional”, which are rarely used by the Chinese press nowadays. According to the local diplomats of the American embassy by the way, this should not be taken too seriously, as the Chinese standpoint in this issue has not changed, and this is absolutely clear for them, i.e., that the Communist Party of China wishes to maintain the status quo of the Korean Peninsula, and forces the DPRK to do accordingly as well. In this, China is even willing to make gestures, like its benign contribution to the July DPRK visit of the American congress member Solarz. The fact that the Chinese press tactfully stayed silent in all of its articles about the 1961 friendship treaty between China and the DPRK cannot be interpreted otherwise than not wanting to put Kim Il Sung into an embarrassing situation, who recently declared that he is willing to terminate the treaties that the DPRK signed with both China and the Soviet Union, if the American party accepts settling relations with the DPRK according to the Korean conditions. The silence around the treaty also indicates that the Chinese leadership is carefully trying to avoid all statements that would possibly encourage the Korean leadership to take serious actions. China is obviously reckoning that a taking a step like this – which currently seems to be improbable – anyway would mainly distance the DPRK from the Soviet Union. In this light, it is worth to note that from the version of Kim Il Sung’s speech published in the Jenmin Jibao (People’s Daily), the part that described the relations between the DPRK and the socialist countries was simply omitted. It is also noteworthy to point out the other slight alteration of the Chinese press: from the part of Kim Il Sung’s speech demanding the dissolution of the imperialist blocs, the ‘imperialist’ adjective was left out.The Chinese press tried to reduce the weight and sharpness of Kim Il Sung’s sharp anti-imperialist statements as much as possible from its published materials.Ribánszki RóbertAmbassador\n",

      "Translation from Koreanto Cde. KIM IL SUNG!I want to remind you that such a situation has been created in the country as a result of the gross violation of intra-Party democracy and the persecution of honest Communists which makes a return to my homeland impossible for me, although I have fought with other comrades for the liberation of the motherland and people's power for 25 years.Consequently, I consider it necessary to write you an open letter in which I will try to lay out my views.As regards the intra-Party question, I ask you to seriously consider my written statement addressed to the CC of the Worker's Party and which was sent to Pyongyang.First, I want to say that in the necessary conditions I will try to make my statement, removing all materials from there strictly regarded as secret, [or] the property of other Parties. Such a step will be dictated by the fact that fraternal Parties have been informed about the situation in the Korean Workers Party.Of course I do not desire this, but in the interests of the Party I want to solve all the burning issues from positions of Communist principles.In a situation when power is concentrated in the hands of a few people and when it manifests its properties in all spheres of government and Party life, it actually becomes impossible to eliminate serious shortcomings in Party work through intra-Party struggle. I think that you will not deny this fact.The Party leadership is using the Party press organs and its organizations of all levels for the sake of the achievement of unjust ends, and subjects honest Communists to persecution. I remind you of this to soberly assess the situation which has been created inside the Party. If you take a principled position in the solution of Party problems then it is not too late to eliminate the serious mistakes in our Party and government work.Please consider the comradely comments made by the CPSU and CCP representatives before the September CC Plenum in Pyongyang again more deeply and comprehensively. It is true that you are trying to conceal this fact from the Party masses. But, as you know, almost everyone in Pyongyang knows about this.You should be aware that your unjust actions are forcing many comrades from our Party and fraternal Parties to think about the situation which has been created in Korea. We should all recognize with sorrow the fact that the international authority of the Worker's Party has been undermined as a result of the violation of Communist principles.You also should be aware that in reports about Korea published in the pages of the press of fraternal Parties everyone increasingly tries not to connect the achievements of our country with the name of Kim Il Sung. Why are they acting this way? Yes, because several words of praise said to our Party are immediately used as a weapon to suppress the critical comments of individual comrades and as political capital to smother a voice against the cult of personality.With the aid of the power which has been concentrated in the hands of sycophants and Cde. Kim Il Sung an atmosphere of fear and naked subjection has been created in the country in the conditions of which Communists and all the people now live. You yourself well know what all this has cost. At the present time in Pyongyang even cadre avoid meeting one another since they are afraid.Cde. Kim Il Sung! It is necessary to understand that it is extremely unjust when they try to preserve caprice and lawlessness with the method of pressure. If you think so, then this is a big mistake. The method of pressure and violence in Party work is incompatible with the Communist principles expressed in the international workers movement. You also know that history develops in accordance with the objective laws of social development. As historical experience shows, with the aid of a government injustice, including lawlessness, can take on the coloration of justice for a certain time. But some time will pass and history will submit all these injustices for the condemnation of public opinion. Some comrades who fought against Japanese domination in Korea itself are now occupied with the investigation of the matter of the murder of one comrade who was Chairman of the Kangwon Province Party committee immediately after the liberation of Korea. His body was discovered near Pyongyang under the snow in spring of the next year. It is known that he opposed a reassessment of the revolutionary activity of Cde. Kim Il Sung at one meeting, and was killed after the meeting. The organizer and murderer of this comrade needs to be finally exposed. We also know that right now they are looking for those comrades who went missing at one time.The exploiting classes punish with the method of terror. How many people who opposed Kim Il Sung at one time were left alive? They also wanted to get Cde. Pak Il out of the way, but fortunately he was saved with the aid of foreign friends. This fact is not a secret to anyone. Impermissible, unscrupulous methods of fighting have also been used in the course of the current intra-Party struggle and all possible slanders have been created against those who criticized the cult of personality. We all know that the family members of Cde. Yun Kong Hum, S[o] Hwi, and Ri Pil-gyu, who are now in China, are being persecuted. It is time to put an end to this shameful fact. I am personally demanding this. Cde. Kim [Chang Hym], who is being treated in Moscow, was immediately summoned to Pyongyang only because he had the courage to hurl several critical comradely comments directed to Cde. Kim Il Sung. Before his arrival in Pyongyang, they had already managed to take away the car reserved for him and the telephone from his apartment. After the August Plenum Cdes. Choe Chang-ik and Pak Chang-ok were evicted from [their] apartments at the order of Cde. Pak Geum-cheol himself.All these facts demonstrate how groundless are the accusations made against Cdes. Choe Chang-ik, Yun Kong Hum, S[o] Hwi, Pak Chang-ok, and Ri Pil-gyu. These accusations concern their personal lives, their biographical data, etc. I demand that an end be put to this shameful fact.I know from personal experience that your accusations are false. You well know that similar accusations are being made against me, too. This can be judged from the telegram I have received from Pyongyang.During our troops' retreat I was in Northeast China at the order of the Government where I was performing an important assignment of the Party and Government with the aid of the Chinese comrades. When I returned to Pyongyang you, the Commander-in-Chief of the People's Army, and Cde. Nam Il, suggested that I work as Chief of the Intelligence Directorate. At first I intended to decline this work, but I agreed to work in this position at your insistence. After three months they sent me to Kaesong for the negotiations on an armistice in Korea as a member of the delegation. When I left for Kaesong I asked you and the Minister of National Defense to organize a review of my activity, especially with regard to finances, in order to avoid any gossip and discussions on this score in the future. As a result of the review it was revealed that I had committed no infractions, which you then confirmed yourself.After I was released from the responsibilities of chief delegate in the Military Armistice Commission I also asked you and the Chief of the General Staff of the KNA [Korean People's Army] to conduct a corresponding review of my activity. It was established as a result of the review that there were no shortages of material assets. You know all these facts very well. And, in spite of all these evident facts, how is one to explain the content of the enciphered telegram in which it is suggested that I go to Pyongyang in order to clear up questions concerning my past activity in the field of finances[?] I explain this as nothing other than an attempt to take revenge on me for directly expressing my attitude toward the issue of the cult of personality of Kim Il Sung in our Party at the 3rd congress. I have developed a certain suspicion that you have been working out a plan of political and physical destruction against me since am one of those who know more than others of the violation of the norms of Party life, secret information in the relations of our Party and Government with fraternal parties and Governments, and the weak points of the sycophants who have wormed themselves into power.It is true, I do not know under whose supervision such a malicious plan is being hatched with respect to me but one thing is clear, that such a plan cannot be assessed as anything other than the act of a coward and unprincipled politician.Is it really acceptable to you to organize all sorts of sycophants and careerists around yourself who even yesterday spoke only Japanese and shouted at every intersection, \"Long live the Emperor of Japan!\". You are pushing really honest revolutionaries away from yourself with this.Is it possible for us to work together in current conditions, when the slightest critical statement against sycophants is assessed as an attempt to \"overthrow\" the leadership of the Party and Government? Can one place dependence in the Party leadership in such a situation?Cde. Kim Il Sung! We have embarked upon the path of a revolutionary struggle not for those sycophants who have gathered around to persecute and insult us, and not for this did we fight foreign colonizers while risking our lives. You ought to think about this. Further, we did not take part in a revolution under the banner of the KKP [Korean Communist Party] and fight in the underground in order to occupy high posts and ensure [our] personal welfare.When we fought on the front lines and in the enemy's rear, we did not know that whether we would see our homeland liberated in our lifetimes. But we firmly knew that we stood on the right path illuminated by the Communist idea, and therefore we had no fear of death.I well know why Cde. Kim Chang-man, whom you love very much in your own way, now occupies the post of Deputy Chairman of the CC. In his activity he tries in every way to belittle the role of those comrades who fought in China and returned from Yanan. Their revolutionary past has been trampled on. Cde. Kim Chang-man has stubbornly preached the theory that only the partisan struggle of Kim Il Sung and the activity of the \"Society for the Rebirth of the Fatherland\" constitute the history of the anti-Japanese struggle of the Korean people. We do not regard such as political figures, if [I] may say so. We want to say with pride that, without sparing our own lives, we fought the enemies of our homeland at a time when you were in Khabarovsk.I know that you won't like this letter. At the same time I realize that this letter will force you to think up all sorts of false accusations against me and my relatives.However, no difficulties and obstacles will force me to reject revolutionary truth and I am ready to continue my struggle for the sake of the triumph of justice. If the government in Korea were anti-popular then I would organize an underground struggle without hesitation.However, we firmly know that, in spite of the gross mistakes and shortcomings in Party life, our country is going along the path of building socialism under the leadership of the Party. That is why for my part I will help you in this struggle in every possible way.I think that the Party feeling of a Communist is not determined by his unquestioning subordination to a incorrect one-sided decision of the leadership. But, on the contrary, the genuine Party feeling of a Communist assumes his uncompromising struggle with shortcomings in the interests of truth and the proletarian class. In other words, a Communist armed with a Marxist-Leninist world view, dialectical materialism, is obliged to persistently fight for the elimination of shortcomings and mistakes which are at odds with the truth in order to strengthen the Party ranks and raise the Party's authority. It is precisely a Communist, acting this way, who can consider himself a real Party member in whom Party feeling is strong.Nowhere is it said in the classic works of Marxism-Leninism that a Communist unquestioningly subordinates himself to those leaders whose actions violate the principles of Marxism-Leninist truth. In not a single fraternal Party do they demand that a Communist unconditionally bow his head before those leaders whose policy clearly violates Marxism-Leninist principles.I well know with what purpose you are recalling me from Moscow. You want to force me to write a \"self-denunciatory\" letter in which I would slander myself and my comrades for belonging to a group you have invented. You want to subject me to house arrest and then you want to knock me off-balance by threats and intimidation. And when life itself is nothing for me you will fabricate all sorts of materials against me. I well know that you and your subordinates are experienced people in this matter.Right now you are demanding such materials from [Ko Bon Gi], who was subjected to house arrest. I know that you also want to use me as one witness confirming the correctness of your invented materials.I will never become such a perjurer. For such an action of mine you will class me as a Communist who does not obey Party CC decisions and a violator of Party discipline. And you will punish me on the basis of this. Formally, I am not actually obeying that Party discipline forcibly established by you by force but in fact you are committing illegal acts, unjustly classing honest Communists as anti-Party elements and punishing them undeservedly.In such a situation it is better to be stigmatized than to be a scoundrel against what is true and right.I have children and relatives on whose heads are also coming down persecutions only because they are children and relatives of an \"anti-Party factionalist\". I personally will not put up with this.As a revolutionary I chose a path of difficulties and obstacles in the interests of the triumph of truth. As a revolutionary my conscience does not allow me to embark upon the path of sycophancy and servility. But I firmly know that history will describe the current intra-Party struggle in our Party from correct positions. For my part, if possible, I will exert efforts to write a truthful book about the struggle of the Korean revolutionaries.I will also try to publish a book or article in which I will try to truthfully tell the story of the anti-Japanese movement of the Korean people. I understand that such articles are hard to print but I firmly believe that the time will come and these articles will see the light.I have lived and fought for truth to triumph. I will live the same way. By virtue of these reasons I cannot be a devoted \"revolutionary\" to you and therefore do not have an opportunity to return home right now. My native land, in whose name I have fought, risking my life, is very dear. My old parents, brothers and comrades, live in this land, I was born and grew up in this land, and it is endlessly dear to me.But in conditions when truth and right not allowed in life I am forced to temporarily refuse to return home. I consider it necessary to say that all these negative events in our life are a typical manifestation of the cult of personality in our Party.On the basis of the above I request the Central Committee of the Party to consider the following request of mine:1. Take care that I could live on Soviet or Chinese territory and transfer my Party affiliation to the CPSU or CCP. The number of my Party card is 00010. As you know I joined the ranks of the Communist Party of Korea before the liberation of Korea. Documents of my Party membership are in the Party records department of the CC.2. Please accept my assurances that henceforth I will fight for the interests of the people and Party on the whole. However, this does not mean that I will not fight against individuals who are now in senior positions and with whom I have different views on principled questions of Party life.If you have not changed the previously adopted decision with respect to me please send me to the CPSU CC Higher Party School for study, releasing me from the post of Ambassador beforehand.I hope that you will at least grant one of these requests in an organized manner.If you refuse to grant my request in an organized manner I will be forced to decide all these questions myself through my own efforts. Firstly, I will write appropriate statements to Cde. K. E. Voroshilov and N. S. Khrushchev. In addition, I will try to enter into talks with representatives of fraternal Parties.The solution to the problems depends entirely on the principled position you will take. I do not preclude the possibility that you will officially ask the Soviet Government to escort me to the border, or you will try and create a difficulty or other obstacles for me. But I will say in advance that it won't turn out your way. You will not be able to destroy me physically.Personally, I would not like for misunderstandings to arise between our countries because of me. But if you continue your persecutions against me then I will try to place your unjust actions which fly in the face of the truth before the court of public opinion. I imagine that all this will cause a temporary commotion in our Party, but in the long term we will be able to eliminate the dictatorship in the Party, ensure intra-Party democracy and collective leadership, and save many honest comrades from systematic persecution.Again, I repeat that I would like for all these issues to be decided through an intra-Party procedure. Recently Cde. Go Hui-man, the Chief of the CC Industry and Transportation Department, who was in Moscow in a Parliamentary delegation, gathered Embassy officials to tell of the results of the August CC Plenum. In his statement the said that Yun Kong-hum had misappropriated an enormous number of pigs and cows while Minister of Trade. He then said that beef and pork had not become tasty for Yun Kong-hum, and therefore he switched to chickens. One could detect flagrant contradictions in his very statement. How is it that a person who ate predominantly chicken meat suddenly misappropriated hundreds of head of cows for the purpose of consumption as food.For my part, I can say the following: when I was at the 3rd Party congress Yun Kong-hum twice invited me to lunch. And it needs to be noted that he treated me, a guest, to only fish. Nowhere did I see beef or pork.Right now a group of sycophants are fabricating all sorts of stories if only to slander honest people. Right now they are bringing his past activity out of the woodwork. We all know very well, but he himself did not conceal that Yun Kong-hum studied in a civil aviation school in Japan when he was 20. They present this fact as service to Japanese imperialism. But meanwhile we know with what goal he entered this school. His goal was to drop a bomb on the building of the Japanese Governor General on a Japanese plane and throw out propaganda leaflets. When his plot was discovered they threw him in prison, where he spent several years. After he got out of prison he went to China, where he joined the rank of the KKP.They are also fabricating imaginary cases with respect to Ri Pil-gyu, S[o] Hwi, and others for the purposes of slander and personal insult.If you tell the truth then why are you silent about yourself[?] For until recently there were ZIS-110 cars, an armored ZIS, a ZIM, a Pobeda, the best American comfortable automobile, and two Willys at your disposal without any need. In addition, you have spent unlimited state money as Prime Minister, while by law you have a firm set salary.You built an enormous European house for your relatives in your home village, [Mangyungbong], with state money. Moreover, you made a grave to your mother like an imperial one. An enormous amount of state money was spent for all this.You ought to listen to the voice of the people, which says that one could build a school, hospital, and other institutions of social amenities with this money.I am personally demanding the reinstatement in the Party of those comrades expelled from the Party after the August CC Plenum for opposing the cult of personality. I also demand that they be reinstated in those posts they had before expulsion. It is time to halt any propaganda of slander and insults against comrades who have been expelled from the Party.And, finally, I insistently demand the removal from the Party leadership of all the ardent sycophants and bootlickers, Pak Geum-cheol, Kim Chang-man, Pak Jeong-ae, Nam Il, Han Sung-do, and others. And, finally, I demand that Pang Hak-se, who illegally arrested thousands of people and thereby violated the sacred duty of a Communist, be put on trial.I await a rapid response to my letter.RI SANG-JO\tThe orthography and punctuation are as in the original.Authenticated: [signed] B.

      "Date: 21.03.1973Sender: Direction II RelationsTo: Pyongyang 02/01810Comrade Chief of Mission,We are hereby presenting a synthesis of the opinions formulated by the bureau in Pyongyang concerning the second session of the SNCC [South-North Coordinating Committee], which took place in Pyongyang between 14-16 March 1973:The session took place on the background of pronounced antagonisms between the two sides and concluded without clear solutions to issues discussed, due to fundamental differences of opinions.Throughout discussions, Northern representatives, abandoning the issues opened towards consideration during the last session, proposed new ideas which surprised the Southern delegation and were not retained by the latter for further reflection.The Northern co-president launched thereupon the idea of matching the number of 5 SNCC members from each side with the chiefs of staff from both militaries, or of creating a subcommittee made up of representatives of the two armies.Showing that this new proposal goes beyond its mandate and putting it into practice is premature given the existing conditions, the Southern side suggested the creation during the present session of two subcommittees—economic and social-cultural. Northern representatives refused to take in consideration the creation of only two committees, insisting on the simultaneous creation of all 5 committees planned during the co-presidents’ meeting in November 1972 (political, military, diplomatic, economic and cultural).Due to the cautious attitude of the South and the “all or nothing” strategy of the north, the session ended without any notable success.Visible change in the position of the DPRK (the rejection of Southern proposals which, though did not exhaust all available possibilities, offered nevertheless the framework for economic, cultural, sports, etc. types of exchanges and contacts) has a lot to do with the country’s first victories resulting from synchronizing the inter-Korean dialogue with international developments (the opening of Sino-American dialogue regarding withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea).It is obvious that the DPRK is attempting, with the help of the People’s Republic of China or by itself, to gain the time necessary for obtaining the disengagement of the U.S. from the peninsula, which in turn would ensure a position of superiority for Pyongyang in inter-Korean negotiations. Conversely, the DPRK is expecting practical results from its comprehensive international campaign of building contacts.The new DPRK tactics aims at achieving immediate objectives of unification without South Korea, or even against it.The continuation of inter-Korean dialogue will therefore retain a formal character, depending mostly on indirect actions and various contingencies.\n",

      "일자: 21.03.1973발신: 제2관계국수신: 평양02/01810대사동지 귀하,우리는 3월 14일에서 16일 사이 평양에서 열린 남북조절위원회 2차 회담과 관련된 평양 부서의 의견을 취합하여 이와 같이 전달합니다.이 회담은 양측이 서로에 대한 적대심을 표출하는 가운데, 논의된 문제에 대한 명확한 해결책을 도출하지 못한 채로 종료되었다. 이는 의견의 기본적인 입장 차이 때문이었다. 회담 과정 동안 북측 대표단은 지난 회담에서 논의가 시작된 주제들을 포기한 채, 새로운 사안을 제안하여 남측 대표단을 당황하게 하였으며, 계속적인 논의를 위해 후자를 유지하지도 않았다.북측의 공동위원장은 각각 참모총장을 포함하여 5인의 남북조절위원회 인사를 구성하거나 또는 양 군의 대표단으로 이루어진 부위원회 구성을 제안하였다.현재의 조건을 감안할 때 새로운 제안이 [위원회의] 권한 밖이며 이의 실행 또한 시기상조임을 밝히며, 남측은 동 회담에서 두 개의 부위원회 – 경제와 사회문화 – 개설을 제안하였다. 북측의 대표단은 두 개에 불과한 부위원회의 일부 개설 검토를 거부하였으며, 1972년 11월 열릴 공동위원장 회담에서 계획된 총 5개 위원회(정치, 군사, 외교, 경제 및 문화)의 동시적인 개설을 고집하였다. 북측의 “전부이거나 전무이거나” 전략에 남측은 조심스러운 태도를 보였으며, 따라서 이 회담은 눈에 보이는 성공 없이 종료되었다.조선민주주의인민공화국의 입장에서 눈에 띄는 변화(모든 가능성을 닫아버린 것은 아니나 경제, 문화, 스포츠 등에 대한 교류와 접촉 프레임워크를 마련하고자 한 남측의 제안을 거절)는 국제개발과 남북대화의 수준을 맞추고자 한 시도에 첫 승리와 관련이 깊다(남측에서의 미군철수에 대한 미-소 대화의 시작).조선민주주의인민공화국이 중화인민공화국 또는 그들 스스로 미국을 반도에서 몰아내는 데에 필요한 시간을 벌고자 함은 분명한 사실이며, 이를 통해 평양은 남북대화에서 유리한 입지에 설 수 있을 것이다.역으로, 조선민주주의인민공화국은 그들의 총괄적인 대외 홍보 활동으로 인한 실질적인 성과를 기대하고 있다. 새로운 조선민주주의인민공화국 전략은 남조선과 무관하게, 또는 남조선을 물리치고라도 즉각적으로 통일을 이루고자 하는 목적을 가진다.따라서 남북대화의 지속은 형식적인 성격을 띠게 될 것이며, 간접적인 행동과 다양한 변수에 크게 의지할 것이다.\n",

Mao Zedong then pointed out that he had informed the Korean comrades of the possibility of concluding a treaty of friendship, alliance, and mutual aid (after unification) on the model of the Chinese-Soviet treaty but that the Chinese government would make a final decision on the conclusion of such a treaty only after consulting with Cde.

      "CIPHERED TELEGRAM NO. 25348SECOND CHIEF DIRECTORATE OF THE GENERAL STAFF OF THE SOVIEV ARMYTop Secret. 7 October 1950 Copies to:  1 - cde. Stalin2 - cde. Stalin3 - cde. Molotov4 - cde. Malenkov5. - cde. Beria6. - cde Mikoyan7. - cde. Kaganovich8 .- cde. BulganinReceived from Beijing on 11: 55 on October 7, 1950.URGENT [vne ocherednaia]To FILIPPOV [STALIN]In response to your no. 4676On 6 October, at 22:30 of Beijing time I visited MAO ZEDONG and passed to him your reply.After listening to me, MAO ZEDONG declared that:1. He is in full agreement with your assessment of the current international situation and the prospects of its possible evolution.2. He is very glad that your answer speaks about a joint struggle of China and the USSR against the Americans. He emphasized that, if one goes to war, then, unquestionably, one should go to war now. He added that he has just expressed the analogous idea at the session of the Politburo CC CCP.3. As to the dispatch of Chinese troops to Korea, MAO ZEDONG believes that it makes sense to send not five-six divisions, but at least nine divisions. However, he pointed out the extremely low level of technical equipment of these divisions, as they have only 108 artillery pieces and do not have tanks at all.MAO ZEDONG also remarked, referring to the materials received from the Korean friends that the US corps (three divisions) include around 1,500 artillery pieces of different caliber, including tanks.MAO ZEDONG believes that in order to defeat one US corps, Chinese should have four-to-one superiority in human force and three-to-one superiority in technical equipment.MAO ZEDONG underlined that he can easily resolve the issue of infantry, thanks to available reserves, but as to technological equipment of Chinese troops they totally count on the assistance of the Soviet Union.He also said that currently they do not have the trained cadres to man artillery unites, tanks and other technical means.Concerning the issue about the timing of entry of Chinese troops into Korea, MAO ZEDONG noted that they are ready to start moving their divisions in the next few days, but he believes it is not appropriate to make haste with this; it would be better to let Americans a chance to advance deeper to the North, since this would lead to their dispersal and would facilitate for the Chinese to defeat it in parts.4. MAO ZEDONG paid special attention to the issue of aviation. He pointed out that, according to the data of the Korean friends, Americans have about 1000 aircraft in the Korean theater, while the Chinese still have no aviation. It is necessary to have aviation, in the opinion of MAO ZEDONG, for:a) the cover of the Chinese ground troops that will be sent to Korea;b) for combat operations on the front;c) for the cover of the largest industrial centers: Shanghai, Tianjin, Beijing, Mukden (Anshan, Fushun).MAO ZEDONG believes that the Americans can, first of all, destroy from the air the Chinese industrial base, disorganize economic life and mess up communications. Such a situation, said MAO ZEDONG, might create serious discontent in the country, particularly on the part of national bourgeoisie, and put the people’s government in an extremely difficult position. MAO ZEDONG declared that the Chinese government cannot ensure itself the air cover of the troops and industrial centers, and the equipment from the Soviet Union is essential.5. MAO ZEDONG drew attention to the fact that in Korea the roads and communications are destroyed and this gravely complicates the task of supplying the army. In this case, he said, the Chinese could rely only on Soviet assistance in providing transportation means.6. MAO ZEDONG declared that the Chinese government does not possess sufficient funds for purchasing the required armaments for aviation and the ammunition. The entire 1951 budget is two billion two hundred million American dollars, of which only two hundred million could be directed for the armament.7. Having said all the above, MAO ZEDONG said it is necessary to send immediately ZHOU ENLAI and LIN BIAO to report to you on the developments and all the considerations of the Chinese friends. ZHOU ENLAI and LIN BIAO may depart by plane on 8 October. They could be flown from Beijing until Irkutsk. Our special plane is required in Irkutsk.MAO ZEDONG expressed a wish, that ZHOU ENLAI and LIN BIAO were accompanied by SHI ZHE and FEDORENKO. Present at the conversation were: ZHOU ENLAI, U SU XIAN and FEDORENKO. The conversation lasted for 1 hour and 45 minutes.  I am waiting for your instructions,ROSHCHINNo. 2318 7.10.50[...]\n",

The withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea.2. The withdrawal of American troops from the Taiwan strait and from the territory of Taiwan.3. The Korean question must be resolved by the Korean people themselves.4.

      "SECOND MAIN ADMINISTRATION OF THE GENERAL STAFF OF THE SOVIET SOVIET ARMYCIPHERED TELEGRAM No. 25199Copies: Stalin (2), Molotov, Malenkov, Beria, Mikoyan, Kaganovich, BulganinFrom BEIJING Received 12:153.10.1950TOP PRIORITY TTO FILIPPOV [STALIN]I report the answer of MAO ZEDONG to your [telegram] No. 4581:“I received your telegram of 1.10.50 [1 October 1950]. We originally planned to move several volunteer divisions to North Korea to render assistance to the Korean comrades when the enemy advanced north of the 38th parallel.However, having thought this over thoroughly, we now consider that such actions may entail extremely serious consequences.In the first place, it is very difficult to resolve the Korean question with a few divisions (our troops are extremely poorly equipped, there is no confidence in the success of military operations against American troops), the enemy can force us to retreat.In the second place, it is most likely that this will provoke an open conflict between the USA and China, as a consequence of which the Soviet Union can also be dragged into war, and the question would thus become extremely large [kraine bol'shim].Many comrades in the CC CPC [Central Committee of the Communist Party of China] judge that it is necessary to show caution here.Of course, not to send out troops to render assistance is very bad for the Korean comrades, who are presently in such difficulty, and we ourselves feel this keenly; but if we advance several divisions and the enemy forces us to retreat; and this moreover provokes an open conflict between the USA and China, then our entire plan for peaceful construction will be completely ruined, and many people in the country will be dissatisfied (the wounds inflicted on the people by the war have not yet healed, we need peace).Therefore it is better to show patience now, refrain from advancing troops, [and] actively prepare our forces, which will be more advantageous at the time of war with the enemy.Korea, while temporarily suffering defeat, will change the form of the struggle to partisan war.We will convene a meeting of the CC, at which will be present the main comrades of various bureaus of the CC. A final decision has not been taken on this question. This is our preliminary telegram, we wish to consult with you. If you agree, then we are ready immediately to send by plane Comrades ZHOU ENLAI and LIN BIAO to your vacation place, to talk over this matter with you and to report the situation in China and Korea.We await your reply.MAO ZEDONG 2.10.50”1. In our view MAO ZEDONG's answer is indicative of a change in the original position of the Chinese leadership on the Korean question. It contradicts the earlier appraisal, which was repeatedly expressed in conversations of MAO ZEDONG with YUDIN, KOTOV and KONNOV; [and] LIU SHAOQI with me, which were reported at the time. In these conversations, it was noted by them that the people and the PLA [People's Liberation Army] are ready to help the Korean people, the fighting spirit of the PLA is high and it is able, if necessary, to defeat the American troops, regarding them as weaker than the Japanese.2. The Chinese government undoubtedly could send to Korea not only five-six battle ready divisions, but even more. It goes without saying that these Chinese troops are in need of some technical equipping in antitank weapons and to some extent in artillery.The reasons for the changes in the position of the Chinese are not yet clear to us. It is possible to suppose that it has been influenced by the international situation, the worsening of the position in Korea, [and] the intrigues of the Anglo-American bloc through [Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal] NEHRU, who has urged the Chinese toward patience and abstention [from intervention] in order to avoid catastrophe.ROSHCHINNo. 2270 3.10_______________________Dec[iphered by] Araushkin 12.50 3.10 [12.50 p.m. 3 October]Typ[ed by] Doronchenkova 13.20 3.10[1.20 p.m. 3 October]Typ[ed in] 10 copies [copies no.] 9-10 -(to file)\n",

At present, all these questions have been clarified.Mao Zedong pointed out that now it is advantageous for them to dispatch the Chinese troops into Korea. The Chinese have the absolute obligation to send troops to Korea.At this point, they are sending the first echelon composed of nine divisions. Although it is poorly armed, it will be able to fight against the troops of Syngman Rhee. In the meantime, the Chinese comrades will have to prepare the second echelon.The main thing that we need, says Mao Zedong, is air power which shall provide us with air cover. We hope to see its arrival as soon as possible, but not later than in two months.Furthermore, Comrade Mao Zedong noted that at present the government of the People's Republic of China cannot pay in cash for the armaments delivered. They hope to receive arms on credit.Thus, the 1951 budget will not be affected, and it will be easier for them to explain it to the democrats.In conclusion, Mao Zedong stated that the leading comrades in the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party believe that the Chinese must come to the assistance of the Korean comrades in their difficult struggle. To discuss this matter, Zhou Enlai will have to meet comrade Filippov again.Zhou Enlai is being sent new instructions.R O S H C H I NNo. 240813.10 [13 October]\n",

Algeria and indicated that the UAR wished to decide on measures after the situation had become clear.2. Premier Zhou discussed recent developments in the Vietnam situation.Premier: I first would like to convey to Your Excellency the greetings of China’s leaders. Your Excellency’s last visit to China made a profound impression on them.Sabry: How is Chairman Mao?Premier: He is quite fine. He is now traveling outside Beijing. Several days ago I saw him in Hangzhou. I recall that when Your Excellency visited China, you saw him in Shanghai.Sabry: That is right.Premier: For a time recently, our press did not publish news about him. The outside world then started many rumors. The source of these rumors was Moscow’s foreign press agency [note: likely the Novosti Press Agency].Sabry: Doesn’t the Premier feel tired, travelling around this way?Premier: I am used to it.When we had dinner just now, we received a statement of the Algerian Council of the Revolution. I assume that Your Excellency has already seen it. Does Your Excellency also have some new information?Sabry: Most of it is speculation from various sources -- Spanish, French, and British -- and various interpretations. We have still not received any new telegram from our embassy, as decryption takes time. Regarding the conversation between Bouteflika and our ambassador, I must add that [Abdelaziz] Bouteflika said that he had arrested [Ahmed] Ben Bella and would put him on trial.(Sabry’s son then entered the room and shook hands with the Premier, who in passing welcomed Madam Sabry’s October visit to China.)Premier: The Council of the Revolution’s statement spoke of eliminating Ben Bella’s influence.Sabry: Bouteflika told our ambassador that he would put him on trial and that, if found guilty, would certainly receive a felony conviction. Our Presidency Secretary-General [Abdel Magid] Farid is now in Algiers, participating in the preparatory work of the Asian-African Conference. On the basis of information obtained from a close assistant to Ben Bella, they all believe that the coup d’état sold out Ben Bella. They say that Boumedienne the day before was among those who went to the airport to welcome Ben Bella on his return from an inspection of Oran, and then early the next morning launched the coup d’état, which shows that these people's course of action is very treacherous. They believe that the coup d’état will not easily succeed and that there will certainly be a reaction. Farid observed that the masses on the street were quiet and without reaction, with only a universal feeling of surprise and astonishment regarding the coup. As the situation is difficult to judge, having still not decided on a course of action or how to respond to Bouteflika’s two requests, our approach is to wait for the situation to become a bit clearer before speaking.Premier: What has been the reaction of other countries?Sabry: No government has yet given an official response. The Indian Express has reported a sentiment of doubt in regard to the Second Asian-African Conference, saying that it probably would be impossible to convene it as scheduled. According to our embassy’s reporting, all members of the government and of the National Liberation Front (FLN) Central Committee, except for Ben Bella and [Mohamed Seghir] Nekkache, will continue to hold their original posts. In addition, I have also learned that an Algerian labor organization in France has issued a statement condemning the coup and calling on the Algerian people to remain vigilant and calm in regard to the future of Algeria and the coup d’état against Ben Bella. This was from Radio Paris.Premier: Is this labor organization related to the government?Sabry: It has a relationship with the Party.Premier: So far no country’s government has issued an official response?Sabry: Not one.Premier: Are the conference-place projects for the Asian-African Conference completed yet?Sabry: According to our information, all the conference-place projects, including the meeting hall and residences, will be completed on schedule. We have sent many workers, technical personnel, and hotel administrators. Following the incident, we have instructed them to stay there, continue working, and await new instruction from the government. We have also sent a telegram to the Presidency Secretary-General for him to stay and not return for the time being.Premier: Has the foreign minister arrived there yet?Sabry: Not yet.Premier: Will Subandrio be passing through here?Sabry: Yes. Yesterday he went to Addis Ababa. He will later go to Kenya and Morocco before arriving in Algiers. The situation is very complicated.Premier: In the last two months, relations between Algeria and Morocco seem to have improved. Ben Bella and [King] Hassan met twice.Sabry: Bouteflika indicated that one of the reasons for their opposition to Ben Bella was in his having conceded too much to Morocco and Tunisia in Algeria’s border disputes with Morocco and Tunisia. Bouteflika also was critical of Ben Bella for wishing to go see [Charles] De Gaulle before the Asian-African Conference, knowing well that De Gaulle was against the Asian-African Conference and against Algeria. He believes that Ben Bella’s actions were tantamount to treason. As we see it, however, in the current situation, Algeria has no choice but to have good relations with its neighbors and with France.Premier: We hear that the negotiations between Algeria and France over oil have reached a preliminary agreement.Sabry: According to our experts, this agreement is the best agreement reached between an oil-prospecting country and an oil-producing country. The reason is that in such oil-producing countries as Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Iraq, the benefit that foreign-capital enterprises of such countries as the United States, Britain, and France provide the producing country is the extraction of an oil export duty of 50 percent, but administration of this oil is entirely in the hands of the foreign-capital enterprises, which will make the calculations as they please. There is no way of knowing whether their calculated 50 percent is truly 50 percent. Secondly, the oil price is determined by the foreign-capital enterprises; moreover, after the oil is loaded onto the ship and exported, how its price will be set is unknown. In short, the price for crude oil is low; prices for shipping, refining, and exporting to international markets are high. The extracting companies make a great deal of money through these four procedures, with profits coming from the three processes of transport, refining, and sales on international markets. However, with Algeria’s reaching an agreement with France this time, it can benefit from each procedure, particularly through Algeria's oil pipelines, with 100 percent of the transportation paid to the Algerian government. The signing of this agreement will greatly change the relationship between the eastern Arab countries and other countries receiving oil exploitation and the oil-prospecting countries. De Gaulle accepted this agreement in order to oppose the United States, giving the United States more trouble, because this way other oil-producing countries also would put forward the same conditions. France’s sole condition for accepting this agreement is that Algeria not withdraw from the franc zone. No new government can obtain better conditions.Premier: There is information on Ben Bella going to Paris and signing an oil agreement before the Asian-African Conference.Sabry: Yes. Agreement has been reached on the main projects. All that remains are some technical difficulties.Premier: At present can you still not see some foreign country behind the scenes?Sabry: It is hard to say. All I know is that recently the United States has been terribly active in this area, with the Central Intelligence Agency, in particular, intensifying its activities not only in Algeria but in the UAR and Iraq as well. It is hard to say whether this coup d’état is something that the United States prepared or something domestic. But the first reaction of the US ambassador in Cairo was a happy one. I do not know whether this simply is his own point of view or whether it represents Washington’s viewpoint but he, at least, was happy. The United States is quite satisfied in regard to this coup d’état, if for no other reason than, at a minimum, the very good relations between Ben Bella and [Gamel Abdel] Nasser.Premier: How have negotiations for the United States to provide food aid to you been proceeding?Sabry: Several days ago, the Congress of the United States decided to stop providing aid to the UAR and Indonesia as long as those two countries continued to adopt policies opposing the United States. This was passed last week by the Congress.Premier: This is a deliberate stance of the United States government to have Congress come and apply pressure.Sabry: They easily say that this is an issue for the Congress. In fact, of course, it represents the government’s attitude. If not, how could the senators propose it and a majority pass it? The United States is also closely watching the situation of our food purchases in other countries. For example, we sent a team to purchase food in Argentina. At first the negotiation were going smoothly when, suddenly, the other party announced a halt to negotiations. This is the result of US pressure. Argentina proposed to us a condition difficult for us to accept, that we pay in advance with cash. It goes without saying that our negotiations with Argentina are beneficial. We are willing to sign with Argentina a long-term agreement for five years. For the UAR, this would be the first long-term agreement for the purchase of food signed with a foreign country. For Argentina, there is a surplus of food and no way to store it, which requires a way out.Premier: Does Argentina also export corn?Sabry: We previously imported corn from the United States. In addition to the United States, we also imported from Sudan and Mexico. We now also import from Indonesia. Subandrio has indicated that Indonesia can sell corn to us. If we had an agreement with China, this year's corn problem would be solved. Our difficult period is from now until the end of October.Premier: When I passed through Cairo at the beginning of April, Your Excellency said that the food difficulties were mainly after the October harvest.Sabry: We are short of food mainly in summer. In August there is a small harvest. In October, there is a large one. After the two harvests, there was still not enough, and there was tension in the summer of the second year. We hope that this year the technical measures adopted increase production, but at this point we cannot be sure. If there can be an increase in production, this year's food shortage problem will not be too serious. This year we can import food from China and solve the problem. Our main difficulty at present is that August's first harvest will be small. One should begin planting the crops in May and harvest them in early August, but now the wheat and beans from May have still not been harvested, so it was not possible in May to plant corn over a large area. This year we received wheat and beans in advance and used tractors to speed up the planting, so this August's harvest is expected to be 40 percent greater than that of previous years. The problem now is that cultivating wheat is not economical, requires irrigation, has a high cost of production, and cannot be harvested in two seasons. In addition, if one grows wheat, one cannot grow much cotton, and cotton production is low in cost and high in volume. We have to use laws to force farmers to grow wheat.Premier: Growing wheat will also resolve the water issue. After the great reservoir is built, canals need to be built and water used.Sabry: We are already well prepared before the building of the great reservoir, with both carried out at the same time. Despite our adopting these technical measures, we will still have to import wheat for a while.Premier: When can you start using the high dam’s irrigation equipment?Sabry: This year we started using some of the water of the high dam, 5 billion cubic meters in all, first of all in a large area of the south. In the past this area was cultivated by river floodwaters, with only one growing season per year. This year, we can irrigate 700,000 mu [sic; 1 mu = 1/6 acre]. Next year, with a little better irrigation measures, we will be able to grow rice. The problem is that May and June, when rice is planted, is just the time when water is at its scarcest, because this is before the river flooding, the time when the Aswan and other reservoirs are at their lowest. Then it is necessary to rely on water from Lake Victoria, but the level of water in Lake Victoria often rises and falls with the amount of rainfall. There is thus no way to calculate in advance the area of land to cultivate, because the area of land to cultivate can only be determined by the amount of rainfall in the area of Lake Victoria.Premier: How about the water flowing from the Blue Nile?Sabry: The floodwaters of the Blue Nile, whose origin is Ethiopia, come in July and August, so the water for planting rice must come from Lake Victoria. Once the high dam’s water is stored, we can confirm the amount of land for growing rice.Premier: Are such Commonwealth countries as Canada and Australia not providing food to you?Sabry: We bought 100,000 tons from Australia.Premier: You have not bought any from Canada?Sabry: We still have no diplomatic relations with them and their prices are higher. The volume of our trade with Canada is very small.What is the situation in Vietnam?Premier: South Vietnam has had another coup d’état. That is a place in need of a coup. When passing through Cairo last time, I mentioned to the President and Your Excellency that [Maxwell] Taylor, due to fear of a coup taking place, was delayed in returning to the United States. Now, following his return, a coup d’état has indeed taken place and, rather than produce a civilian government to maintain order in accord with the United States’ way of thinking, they have chosen a military man to be president. Recently, the United States also increased its number of troops, the rainy season is coming, and the National Front for the Liberation of Southern Vietnam is going to expand the war. Taylor, with no way to deal with this, a real headache, went back and requested more troops, which is an escalation, with around 10,000 provided each time. I discussed with Your Excellency the last time that by the end of the year the United States could increase its number of troops to 70,000. At present this remains a possibility. The problem is that these US troops are only stationed to guard bases and ports, sending out the puppet army to fight. But the puppet army does not want to go out and fight, fearing the loss of its bases and the loss of its military strength, which would leave it without capital. Young officers in the puppet regime also demanded that they be given command power. They do not approve of joint military command with the United States. Although more than a few among them have received US military training, there are also many who have received French military training. These men are all self-contradictory. Each time they fight, their self-contradiction will erupt. This is Johnson’s greatest headache.Sabry: Now there is also a great deal of opposition within the United States.Premier: The first time since the war.Sabry: [J. William] Fulbright is also opposed to it.Premier: There are so many people within the Democratic Party who oppose it. The press is also critical of it. The United States faces a dilemma at home and abroad. De Gaulle recently made a public criticism of the United States.Sabry: I hear that the United States has used in Vietnam the B-52 bomber, but there has not been a single person killed by the bombing.Premier: Their own aircraft suffered a mid-air collision.In the Korean War, there were many senior and junior military men who had also participated in the Second World War. Now, in Vietnam, not only the junior military men but the senior ones as well did not participate in the Second World War. Most of the Pentagon’s commanders are staff officers who have not participate in actual combat. Frontline soldiers complain that the commanding officers do not know how to command and ask to return after completing their mission. Bombing, too, starts from the viewpoint of completing missions without regard to objectives. Therefore, a large bomber can be knocked out by a small aircraft. In fact, one cannot blame the military staff if the war is not going well. One has to blame [Lyndon B.] Johnson for being personally unsuited to command. The United States’ press says that Johnson is both a president and a sergeant, busy dealing with issues from morning until night. Only after issuing orders could he go to bed, but then he was awakened at 3:30 in the morning by a telephone call reporting the collision of a bomber with a Chinese aircraft. So each time the telephone rings it is something good or bad, giving him an acute sense of trepidation. This is what his wife herself told reporters. Your Excellency, too, is a military man. Tell me, how can someone fight well like this?This is all I have to discuss today. I may have to stay here with you a few days longer and trouble you some more.Sabry: Your Excellency is welcome to stay here a few days longer.[…] \n",

      "[SED Central CommitteeDepartment of International RelationsSAPMO-BA, archival signature missing]GDR Embassy in DPRKPyongyang, 21 December 1961Noteabout a Conversation with Comrade Kohousek, Ambassador of Czechoslovakia,on 19 December 1961Comrade Kohousek invited me to this conversation to hear more about results of our [SED] Central Committee Plenum, as well as about some questions concerning developments towards a peace treaty [for Germany] and the conversion of West Berlin into a demilitarized Free City. I informed Comrade Kohousek briefly about our policy, the measures we implemented, and some new aspects and developments in the relationship between both [German] states. (Policy of peaceful coexistence etc.).From his perspective, Comrade Kohousek told how the Czechoslovak Embassy attempts to influence opinions of DPRK comrades by showing movies about Berlin and German militarism and revanchism, as well through publishing the [embassy's] bulletin. Regarding attitudes of the KWP about the XXII [CPSU] Party Congress, Comrade Kohousek stated Comrade Kim Il Sung had to maneuver in light of influences and pressures from the Chinese Communist Party. Like Comrade Puzanov, the ambassador of the USSR, Kohousek thinks that, together with Pak Seong-cheol [Pak Song Chol], Kim Il Sung still plays the most positive role in the KWP politburo.I stated my opinion that the following stands in contradiction [to that assessment]: The quite open support for positions of the Albanian leadership through the telegrams to Enver Hoxha, the complete publication of the speech made by the Albanian ambassador at the occasion of the Albanian national holiday, the publishing of Enver Hoxha's provocative reply telegram on the 1st page of the KWP newspaper, the generous arrangement for the Albanian reception – all that although Comrade Kim Il Sung was aware of positions and reactions from the ambassadors of most of the socialist countries. Comrade Kohousek also thought that apparently the influence of the Chinese party is strongest within the Korean army.

With socialist greetings[signed] [Sepp] SchwabAttachmentTranscriptTelegram No. 215 from 19 May 1961Sender: Ambassador SchneidewindTo: Comrade Stude/ Comrade Colonel SchützThere still exists no clear assessment by the North Korean comrades on current developments in South Korea.The statement published on 18 May by ZTAK [“Central Telegraph Agency of Korea;” KCNA] about the situation in South Korea does still contain significant contradictions. On the one hand it does welcome the overthrow of the Chang Myeon Clique, while at the same time it condemns initiators and leading politicians behind the military coup as reactionary. Nevertheless the statement still has lines like the following: “ […] The soldiers, privates, officers, and generals of the South Korean defense forces, who were rising up to stage a military coup, have to reject maneuvers by those who violate their [the defense forces'] demands and attempt to sell out the national interests. They immediately must begin patriotic actions and stand side by side with the people […].”Furthermore: “ […] Since the treasonous Chang Myeon Clique has been finished, it is imperative today to decisively strike against interference and cabals, if one wants to move the currently existing situation in South Korea towards a path of preserving the interests of the fatherland and the nation […].”In light of the openly anti-communist demonstrations held yesterday in Seoul this statement by ZTAK is unsatisfactory. It is still lacking a clear assessment of this reactionary military coup.The diplomatic representatives of socialist countries [in Pyongyang] think the Korean comrades allowed themselves to get confused through the initial statement from American representatives; and also through the fact that students and other circles initially welcomed this military coup out of excitement about the overthrow of Chang Myeon. For the Korean comrades, the military coup came as surprising as the April events last year [1960]. Although this [ZTAK] statement comes out against the reactionary and counterrevolutionary leaders of the coup, in our opinion it is falling short of providing a correct assessment. It fails to point at the enormous danger created by this military coup.Full text of the statement will be sent with next courier.Schneidewind \n",

      "On December 16, the Soviet ambassador informed me that on [December] 11 Kim Il Sung had received the USSR Supreme Soviet delegation headed by [Sharaf] Rashidov. […] the Ambassador summarized the essence of what Kim Il Sung had said in the following words:[…] The current international situation is unfavorable for imperialism, the bankruptcy of American imperialism is becoming more and more manifest. This manifests itself in the following: internally, the USA is facing the prospect of a grave crisis, above all a financial crisis; the USA is suffering military defeats in various parts of the world, primarily in Indochina; the USA is losing its prestige, no one is bowing to it, even its most loyal allies—Jiang Jieshi, Park Chung Hee and [President of South Vietnam] Thieu—are losing their faith in it. […]According to our evaluation, Kim Il Sung said, now no one in the world, not even the USA, wants war. The Japanese people do not want war, Japan is currently unable to wage a war. Neither China nor we want war. Nor do the Soviet Union and the other socialist countries. In our view, under such circumstances it is possible to launch a peaceful attack. This was what we discussed at the [11th Central Committee] plenum [which was held on November 15-23].[…] At the plenum, the situation on the Korean Peninsula was discussed in detail. It was found that here it was also possible to launch a peaceful attack. The introduction of emergency measures revealed the weakness of the South Korean regime. The emergency measures are aimed at suppressing the South Korean [opposition] forces. The progressive forces are still weak in South Korea. There is no revolutionary situation in South Korea, that people [the South Korean population] is weak, the progressive forces need support to gain strength. For this purpose, one must first isolate the regime of Park Chung Hee, then make it go bankrupt. The means to achieve this aim is the peaceful attack. Following the peaceful attack, the South Korean people will see that the DPRK wants peaceful unification and the puppet clique does not want it. We did not, and will not, take any measure in response to the introduction of the emergency measures, Kim Il Sung said. We think we will come forward with new proposals. We wanted to take steps earlier, but now we are waiting a bit because of the introduction of the emergency measures. We want to make a proposal about the exchange of arts collectives and athletes between South and North. We leave an escape hatch for Park Chung Hee by [expressing] our willingness to negotiate with the rightist parties as well, Kim Il Sung said. He can use it if he wants to survive. If he does not [use it], he will perish.  […] In our view, there is nothing special in Nixon’s visit in the Soviet Union. In Stalin’s time, the Soviet Union had talks and signed agreements with Germany and Japan, [but these agreements] did not change [the socialist character of] the Soviet Union. While at that time the Soviet Union was weaker, now it is stronger, militarily stronger than the USA. Thus the Soviet Union is able to adopt a tough position during its talks with the USA. We know that the Soviet Union will not negotiate with Nixon at the expense of the interests of the socialist countries or the DPRK.[…] We will not participate in any kind of anti-Soviet affair. As an example I would like to mention that the Albanians invited us to their [6th] party congress [which was held on 1-7 November 1971]. We knew that they invited splittist [Maoist] groups as well. We were not present at the congress. We also told the Albanians not to send us anti-Soviet documents. Despite this [protest], they keep sending them; we do not publish the anti-Soviet parts [of these documents]. The Albanians are trying to provoke us into adopting an anti-Soviet stance, but we are not going to adopt such a stance. We also warned the Albanian delegate present at the congress of our Youth League not to make an anti-Soviet speech. Despite this [warning], he made such a speech. However, we did not translate the anti-Soviet parts of his speech. […] We will be always on friendly terms with you and we will not adopt an anti-Soviet stance. We think that you will not receive Nixon in the same way as the Romanians received him. […]– 155 – [Jenő] S[ebestyén] –\n",

      "[…]On October 8th, the Soviet ambassador unexpectedly traveled to Moscow, from which place he returned on October 26th. On October 30th, he visited me, and informed me about the following:A [North Korean] delegation headed by Pak Seong-cheol [Pak Song Chol] had traveled to Moscow. Deputy Foreign Minister Ri Man-seok [Ri Man Sok] and Kim Yun-seon [Kim Yun Son], the deputy head of the International Liaisons Office of the [Korean Workers’ Party] CC, were also members of the delegation. There were also experts traveling with the delegation. They spent two days in Moscow. On the request of the Koreans, Comrade Brezhnev had talks with the delegation. The essence of what was said by Pak Seong-cheol is the following:I) According to the Korean leadership’s evaluation, the influence of the rightist parties is considerably decreasing in South Korea, [whereas] the strength of the opposition parties has substantially increased. This is clearly shown by the electoral results, the growth of the movement of progressive forces, and the actions of the student movement. Park Chung Hee is becoming more and more isolated.II) The DPRK must take advantage of this situation so as to compel the South Korean [political] forces to accept the peaceful unification of the motherland. The DPRK has worked out a number of measures with regard to that.     1) In the international sphere, they take advantage of every opportunity and occasion to recruit as many supporters for their policy of peaceful national unification as possible. As far as possible, they intend to make use of the UN and other international organizations, too.    Through political and diplomatic means, they want to bring great international pressure to bear on the USA in order to achieve the withdrawal of its troops and the abrogation of the U.S.-South Korean military treaty.     2) They want to make Japan understand that the U.S. presence in South Korea and Japan as well as the South Korean-[Japanese] treaty hinders the unification of the motherland. They want to achieve the abrogation of the treaty.    3) They turned to the Soviet Union with the direct request that [the USSR] should try to achieve the aforesaid results [in the course of its negotiations] with the USA and Japan.      – 124 – S[ebestyén] –\n",

Kim Il Sung to decide the issue of the citizenship of Soviet Koreans who left the USSR at various times for permanent work in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, in November 1955 by decision of the Presidium of the USSR Supreme Soviet these Koreans were permitted to convert to DPRK citizenship or to accept dual citizenship. On the basis of this the Soviet Embassy in the DPRK [was given] instructions to pursue appropriate work with the Soviet Koreans serving in the DPRK.As Cde. Ivanov, the Soviet Ambassador in the DPRK reported, in the course of the explanatory work for various reasons some of the above Soviet Koreans expressed a desire to return to the USSR. P. T. Kim, A. Ya. Ligay, and L. Yu. Kim addressed such a request. The Koreans friends do not object to their return to the USSR.At the same time as this Cde. Ivanov raises the question, ought he turn to Moscow in each individual case about questions of the return to the USSR of Soviet citizens in Korean service or send them independently if there is agreement to this from the competent Korean bodies.Inasmuch as the Korean friends do not object to the return of individual Soviet citizens among them [they] might consider it advisable to permit the Soviet Embassy in the DPRK to decide locally in each individual case. When this is being done it ought to be pointed out to the Embassy that people who committed misdemeanors or fear difficulties are not sheltered from responsibility by leaving for the USSR and have justified the trust placed in them there, in the DPRK. As regards the request of P. T. Kim, A. Ya. Ligay, and L. Yu. Kim to return to the USSR the Embassy ought to be charged with carefully looking into this question and deciding locally. P. T. Kim and A. Ya. Ligay want to return to the USSR for reason of illness; however, according to available information they have been released from work for other reasons. Kim worked as a Deputy Minister of Trade and Ligay as chief of the Inturist directorate. L. Yu. Kim is a general of the Korean army and was removed from [his] post for misdemeanors he committed, which are not reported in the Soviet ambassador’s telegram.The USSR MFA (Cde. Fedorenko) agrees with these suggestions.A draft CPSU CC decree and telegram to the Soviet ambassador are attached.Deputy Chief of the CPSU CC Department [signature]for Relations with Foreign Communist Parties (I.

During the meeting Kim Il Sung raised the following questions:1. Can they adopt a central committee decision about issuing a loan, about which he earlier asked my advice. They have already calculated the loan at 2 billion won. They have already prepared an example of a bond. He asked agreement to send their representatives to Moscow with draft bonds in order to formulate orders for these bonds. I answered that I had communicated Kim Il Sung's request to Moscow, but had still not received an answer.2. Kim Il Sung asked my advice about whether they can proceed toward forming three additional infantry divisions, so that the total number of the army will be brought to ten divisions. I answered that this question is large and serious, that before adopting a decision you must think through whether you have the necessary material resources for this. I also need time to think through this question before I give you advice on this measure.  3. Kim Il Sung asked me if he can appeal to Comrade Stalin with a request to use in 1950 the credit the Soviet government had allocated for 1951. With this credit they would like to buy in the Soviet Union arms for the three infantry divisions they intend to form. I answered that I will report this question to my government.4. Kim Il Sung further communicated that they intend to call a session of the Supreme People's Assembly for February 25 with the following agenda:1. Regarding the budget for 1950. 2. Regarding the criminal code. 3. Regarding the results of the fulfillment of the national economic plan in 1949. They still do not have a firm decision regarding whether to raise the three questions. Kim Il Sung reported that he had commissioned Pak Heon-yeong [Pak Hon Yong] to write a request to the Soviet government about sending a group of textile workers to the Soviet Union in order to prepare them to work on the Soviet equipment that is arriving. I answered that as soon as I receive his letter I will report it to my government.I ask your orders about what to answer Kim Il Sung regarding the first three questions raised by him [as reported] in this telegram.7.II.50 SHTYKOV[In the margins Stalin wrote \"it is possible\" beside points 1, 2 and 3, \"we don't object\" beside point 4 and \"let him write it\" beside the last paragraph.

      "[...]Strictly secret. I report about the frame of mind expressed by Kim Il Sung during a luncheon at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the DPRK. On January 17 the minister of foreign affairs of the DPRK Pak Heon-yeong [Pak Hon Yong] held a lunch attended by a small circle of persons, on the occasion of the departure of the Korean ambassador Ri Ju-yeon to the Chinese Peoples Republic. At the luncheon from the Korean side were Kim Du-bong [Kim Tu Phong], Kim Il Sung, Pak Heon-yeong, deputy minister of foreign affairs Pak Jeong-jo [Pak Jung Jo], Ri Ju-yeon [Ri Ju Yon]. The trade representative of the PRC Wen Shizhen attended the luncheon. On our side in attendance were myself and the advisers of the embassy Ignatiev and Pelishenko. The luncheon took place in a friendly, warm atmosphere. Kim Il Sung, Pak Heon-yeong and also the Chinese trade representative in their toasts expressed a feeling of love and gratitude toward the Soviet Union and personally toward Comrade Stalin for the liberation [of Korea from Japanese rule] and for the selfless assistance to both the Korean and Chinese people.Kim Du-bong shared his impressions of his trip to the USSR for the 70th birthday of Comrade Stalin. In his account he repeatedly underscored the great interest of the Soviet people in Korea and the numerous wishes for quick unification of the country.During the luncheon Kim Il Sung and the Chinese trade representative, who was sitting next to him, many times enthusiastically conversed with each other in Chinese. From individual phrases it was possible to understand that they were speaking about the victory in China and about the situation in Korea. After the luncheon, in the reception room Kim Il Sung gave advice and orders to his ambassador to China Ri Ju-yeon about his work in China, and moreover, while speaking in Korean, Kim several times said phrases in Russian about how Ri would act boldly in China, since Mao Zedong is his friend and will always help Korea.Then, after Ri Ju-yeon left, Kim, addressing the advisers Ignatiev and Pelishenko in an excited manner, began to speak about how now, when China is completing its liberation, the liberation of the Korean people in the south of the country is next in line. In connection with this he said: “The people of the southern portion of Korea trust me and rely on our armed might. Partisans will not decide the question. The people of the south know that we have a good army. Lately I do not sleep at night, thinking about how to resolve the question of the unification of the whole country. If the matter of the liberation of the people of the southern portion of Korea and the unification of the country is drawn out, then I can lose the trust of the people of Korea.” Further Kim stated that when he was in Moscow, Comrade Stalin said to him that it was not necessary to attack the south, in case of an attack on the north of the country by the army of Rhee Syngmann, then it is possible to go on the counteroffensive to the south of Korea. But since Rhee Syngmann is still not instigating an attack, it means that the liberation of the people of the southern part of the country and the unification of the country are being drawn out, that he (Kim Il Sung) thinks that he needs again to visit Comrade Stalin and receive an order and permission for offensive action by the Peoples' Army for the purpose of the liberation of the people of Southern Korea. Further Kim said that he himself cannot begin an attack, because he is a communist, a disciplined person and for him the order of Comrade Stalin is law. Then he stated that if it is now possible to meet with Comrade Stalin, then he will try to meet with Mao Zedong, after his return from Moscow. Kim underscored that Mao Zedong promised to render him assistance after the conclusion of the war in China. (Apparently Kim Il Sung has in mind the conversation of his representative Kim Il with Mao Zedong in June 1949, about which I reported by ciphered telegram.) Kim said that he also has other questions for Mao Zedong, in particular the question of the possibility of the creation of an eastern bureau of the Cominform. He further stated that on all these questions he will try to meet with Comrade Shtykov and to secure through him a meeting with Comrade Stalin.The advisers of the embassy Ignatiev and Pelishenko, avoiding discussing these questions, tried to switch the discussion to a general theme, then Kim Il Sung came toward me, took me aside and began the following conversation: can he meet with Comrade Stalin and discuss the question of the position in the south and the question of aggressive actions against the army of Rhee Syngmann, that their people's army now is significantly stronger than the army of Rhee Syngmann. Here he stated that if it is impossible to meet with Comrade Stalin, then he wants to meet with Mao Zedong, since Mao after his visit to Moscow will have orders on all questions. Then Kim Il Sung placed before me the question, why don't I allow him to attack the Ongjin peninsula, which the People's Army could take in three days, and with a general attack the People's Army could be in Seoul in several days. I answered Kim that he has not raised the question of a meeting with Comrade Stalin and if he raises such a question, then it is possible that Comrade Stalin will receive him. On the question of an attack on the Ongjin peninsula I answered him that it is impossible to do this. Then I tried to conclude the conversation on these questions and, alluding to a later time, proposed to go home. With that the conversation was concluded. After the luncheon Kim Il Sung was in a mood of some intoxication. It was obvious that he began this conversation not accidentally, but had thought it out earlier, with the goal of laying out his frame of mind and elucidating our attitude to these questions. In the process of this conversation Kim Il Sung repeatedly underscored his wish to get the advice of Comrade Stalin on the question of the situation in the south of Korea, since [Kim Il Sung] is constantly nurturing his idea about an attack.[...]\n",

Kim Il Sung further stated that he will prepare himself for the meeting.Regarding the question of delivering lead from Korea to the USSR, I read the second point of your order.

Organs of power are being created everywhere--even the reactionary elements did not take action against the measures of the government of the DPRK and the People's Army.The successful attack of the People's Army activated the partisans, at present the partisan movement is developing widely in the rear of the South Korean army.However, in connection with the widespread American propaganda over the radio, which is directed against the DPRK, and the frequent attacks by American planes on population points, industrial and military sites in North and South Korea, the political mood of the population is somewhat worsening.Individual attitudes of lack of belief in the final victory have appeared, and in the liberated regions a certain (small) portion of the population is taking a wait and see position.The leadership of the DPRK and the People's Army (Kim Il Sung, Pak Heon-yeong [Pak Hon Yong], Pak Il-u [Pak Il U], Kim Baek, Choe Yeungeun [Choe Yung Un], Kang Geun) correctly evaluate the complicated military-political situation in Korea, believe in full victory and are directing all efforts toward a subsequent broad attack on the south of Korea.KIM IL SUNG and PAK HEON-YEONG understand the difficulties for Korea elicited by the entrance of the Americans into the war against the DPRK and in connection with this they are taking the necessary measures to stabilize human and material resources for the war.KIM IL SUNG asked my opinion about forming additional infantry, tank, and naval units and formations. They intend to introduce universal military service in the DPRK.However, some portion of the leading figures, including KIM DU-BONG [Kim Tu Bong], GWON MIN-GI [Kwon Min Ki] are speaking about the difficulties of conducting a war against the Americans with the forces of Korea and in a cautious way have tried to ascertain from KIM IL SUNG the position of the Soviet Union on this question. (The secretary of KIM IL SUNG reported to me these facts, about a conversation of KIM DU-BONG and GWON MIN-GI with KIM IL SUNG.)The rightist and centrist figures that are entering the government of the DPRK are supporting all measures of the government, but so far are not displaying the necessary direction of activity in the mobilization of their parties in the south of the country.I communicated to KIM IL SUNG that the government of the USSR has satisfied his request for arms and ammunition. The general situation in the KNP [Korean People's Republic, apparently a misspelling of DPRK] continues to remain favorable and makes it possible to continue the active offensive of the People's Army.

In his opinion the troops are moving very slowly, especially in the Central direction. The troop crossing was disorganized, although there was a minister in place there. He expressed dissatisfaction with his [the minister's] work.Further, noting the seriousness of the situation at the front and in the liberated territories and the danger of landings by American troops in the rear or at North Korean ports or airborne landings of troops, he asked me to report to you his request for quick delivery of arms in the following amounts: 50,000 rifles; 5,000 PPSh sub-machine guns, 5,000 PPS [sub-machine guns]; 1,500 light machine guns; 350 heavy machine guns; 200 82mm mortars; 78 120mm mortars, 80 76mm ZIS-3 artillery pieces; 24 122mm howitzers; 60 37mm anti- aircraft guns; 120 machine guns; 500 trucks.All these arms are needed for the formation of two divisions, 12 battalions of marines and for the formation of security detachments.Because of American air attacks on the railroad stations in the region of Kanko [Hamheung], Seisin [Cheongjin], he asked that the arms be sent on an accelerated schedule through Manchuria [along the route of] Andong-Sinuiju-Pyongyang.He also communicated that they have begun fitting out reserve regiments and 2 tank brigades and that these need arms and tanks.Further in the conversation he asked advice about how better to organize troop command in the complicated situation. Since the People's Army is fighting against American troops, he considers it necessary to strengthen the leadership of the army.Further he asked advice about how better to organize troop command and what kind of organizational command structure to choose so that the General Staff is brought closer to the troops.After consulting with General VASILIEV we proposed the following structure:1. To create two army groups headed by Military Councils composed of: a commander, a member of the Military Council and a chief of staff.To place 4-6 units under the command of each army group.2. To create a front headquarters headed by a commander of the front, a chief of staff and a member of the Military Council of the front.The front headquarters should be created from [the facilities and personnel of] the General Staff.3. To preserve the Ministry of National Defense, since it already exists only in a reduced form.The Ministry's task should be the supply of combat troops with everything needed (foodstuffs, fuel, transport, ammunition) as well as the training of reserves, new troop formation and the organization of anti-aircraft defense for the northern part of the republic.4. To appoint Kim Il Sung as Supreme Commander of troops. He agreed with our proposals.The restructuring will proceed without harm to the military operations on the front.He then asked our opinion about how best to arrange the disposition of commanding cadres.From my part I proposed to appoint the following group commanders: Deputy Minister in charge of artillery Mu Deun for the left flank group, and for the commander of the right flank group Kim Gu, Deputy Chief of the General Staff (presently commanding an operational group). To appoint as commander of the front the Deputy Chairman of the Cabinet of Ministers and Minister of Industry, Kim Chaek (he knows military affairs, was a partisan and served in the Chinese brigade in Khabarovsk, is a very strong-willed, thoughtful and brave man).To appoint as Chief of Staff of the front Gang Geun, who is now Chief of the General Staff.The Minister of National Defense will remain in his post. He will manage the formation of new units and the organization of anti-landing defense, and also supplying troops with everything needed.They want this measure to be passed through the military committee on July 4 or 5. I judge that in this complicated situation this measure will yield positive results.The staff of the front will move to Seoul in the near future.I ask your permission:1. To have two advisers in every army group (adviser for the group commander and adviser for the artillery commander).2. I ask your permission for the main military adviser Comrade VASILIEV to go to Seoul with a group of officers, together with the staff of the front, and to be permanently located there with the staff.3. I ask you to hasten the resolution of the questions touched on.SHTYKOVNo. 439/sh.4.7.50.Copies: Stalin (2), Molotov, Beria, Malenkov, Mikoyan, Kaganovich, Bulganin.\n",

      "in the clearTELEGRAMfrom PYONGYANG30 June 1950MOSCOW, USSR MFA, Cde. GROMYKOI am passing on a 30 June report of the High Command of the DPRK People's Army.The American imperialists pushing their agents, the traitorous clique of Syngman Rhee, to launch an internecine war, have begun military interference in the internal affairs of Korea in order to colonize our Motherland. American aircrafts began to bomb cities and villages beginning on 26 June. At 1100, 26 June nine American aircrafts attacked the city of Gaeseong, which had been liberated by the People's Army. Our aircrafts put them to flight and, pursuing the American aircrafts, shot down two B-29's over Seoul. At 1730, 28 June six American aircrafts penetrated the [Geumcheon] area north of the 38th parallel with the goal of attacking Pyongyang. Our aircrafts in the areas of [Geumcheon] and [Gyedong] immediately engaged the enemy in battle. One American aircraft was shot down as a result of the battle. On the same day, American aircrafts in large formations conducted an air raid of the city of Seoul, which had been liberated by forces of the Peoples' Army. Squadrons of the air force of the People's Army engaged the American aircrafts in battle and forced them to turn back. An American four-engine aircraft, which was patrolling over the Suwon airfield, was also put to flight. Then, four American four-engine aircrafts at the same airfield were bombed. A squadron of the air force of the People's Army lost four aircrafts in air battles. At 1730 29 June 27, American bombers bombed the city of Pyongyang, dropping more than 300 bombs on the civilian population weighing from 50 to 500 kg. There were casualties among the civilian population as a result of the barbaric bombing. Report of the Creation of People's Committees in Liberated AreasPyongyang, 29 June. In connection with the successful offensive of the heroic People's Army, the population of liberated areas are restoring their bodies of authority, the People's Committees. On 27 June, the People's Committee of the district of [Yeonbaek] of Hwanghae Province was restored, and on 28 June, a Provisional People's Committee was created in the district of [Ongjin]. Provisional People's Committees were created at mass meetings and with the participation of representatives of various sectors of the population.

      "Ciphered TelegramStrictly SecretFrom PyongyangI report the results of the investigation I have organized of the information about the preparation for the withdrawal of American troops and the preparations of the South Korean army for an attack on North Korea, which were pointed out in your telegram. This information was received by the department of political security of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, which is occupied with intelligence gathering in the South.  However, this information, which was received by Korean intelligence at the beginning of April was not reported either to the chief of counterintelligence, who is the deputy minister, or to the minister of internal affairs, and consequently was not sent to the Korean government.The materials received were transferred by the chief of the department of political security to our military intelligence, through which, apparently, they were also received by you.Since this information was not reported either to the minister of internal affairs or to Prime Minister Kim Il Sung, or to our adviser at the ministry of internal affairs, I was also not informed of it.I consider such facts intolerable, I am taking measures toward their elimination and toward putting things in the necessary order.According to the information of our agents and the broadcasts of Seoul Radio, at the present time American and South Korean authorities are conducting negotiations about the withdrawal of American troops from South Korea.  The UN Commission is also participating in these talks, which is obvious from Rhee Syngman’s statement of 16 April, which stated: “…Representatives of the government of the Korean Republic and the government of the USA are presently conducting negotiations about the withdrawal of American troops from Korea.  The UN Commission on Korea has been informed of this.  Consultation with it will be a big help in these negotiations.”According to the statement of American ambassador Muccio on 19 April, the negotiations “will be concluded in the course of several months.”  The establishment of a precise time period for the withdrawal of American troops, according to Rhee Syngman’s statement of 19 April, “will depend on how much time is needed to prepare the army of the Korean Republic.”The minister of national defense of the South Korean government stated to correspondents that the South “has a sufficient number of troops to maintain order in the country after the withdrawal of American troops and, moreover, if North Korea attacks the South, the Army of National Defense not only can withstand it, but can also inflict a perceptible blow.”In connection with plans for a military intrusion into the North, South Korean authorities are increasing the size of the “Army of National Defense.”  According to the reports of our agents, the South Korean Army has increased from 53,600 soldiers as of 1 January 1949, to 70,000 as of the end of the first quarter [of the year].Special attention is paid to the technical, mechanical and special troops, which have grown by 2-4 times.  Measures have been taken to purge the army of ‘unreliable’ soldiers and officers.  Military units are being reinforced by reactionary-minded youths.  Americans are transferring to the South Koreans a significant quantity of various types of weapons and ammunition.  South Korean authorities are taking measures to receive weapons on a much larger scale.  This is the main purpose of Cho Byung-ok’s mission in Washington.South Korean authorities have concentrated a large number of troops in areas adjoining the 38th parallel.According to the information received, the total number of troops in this area has reached 41,000 persons.  The South Korean authorities are paying special attention to the Pyongyang direction.According to the report of the commander of a South Korean battalion, who is connected to the North’s intelligence service, the number of troops in the Pyongyang direction will be increased to 30,000.  The plans for the operation against the North have been worked out and in the first brigade they have already been passed to the battalion commanders.  The actions are supposedly planned for the month of June.  In connection with these plans the South Korean authorities are taking decisive measures to suppress uprisings in the South and to defeat completely the democratic movement.Agents of the South have set up terrorist and subversive groups in every province in the North, which are ordered to recruit new members, conduct espionage, and draft plans for uprisings.  In case military operations begin, they must carry out diversion, terror and organize an uprising.  These groups receive grenades and guns from the South, and, as arrested persons confess, in May they will receive additional weapons.  Such groups have been uncovered in Pyongyang (2), Haeju (1), and Sinuiju (1).I had meetings with Kim Il Sung and Pak Hon Yong regarding all these questions and agreed on carrying out the necessary preliminary measures. Measures have been taken to raise vigilance and strengthen the army and police of North Korea.2/V-49  SHTYKOV\n",

We have repeatedly turned to the Ministry of Foreign Trade, but they tell us that the question of sending Soviet specialists should be decided by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.In the Ministry of Foreign Affairs they say that this is a matter of the Ministry of the Armed Forces, and the latter said that it does not have specialists at its disposition and is not competent to decide this question.Thus up to now the question of selecting and sending Soviet specialists for work in North Korea has practically not been solved.The situation which has developed in North Korea requires the immediate dispatch of Soviet specialists there.All the Japanese specialists who continued to work in North Korea for some time after the Japanese surrender have been repatriated to Japan.[Translator’s note: the following paragraph was highlighted in the left Because of the shortage of engineering and technical personnel the industry and rail transport of North Korea did not fulfill the 1947 first quarter plan.The People’s Committee of North Korea has repeatedly turned to us for aid with engineering and technical personnel.

      "Ciphered TelegramStrictly secretCopying prohibitedFrom PyongyangTo VyshinskyAt the request of Kim Il Sung, on May 12 I had a meeting with him and [Foreign Minister] Pak Heon-yeong [Pak Hon Yong]. During the conversation Kim Il Sung reported to me that upon his return from Moscow he received a letter from Ri Ju-yeon [Ri Ju Yon] (ambassador to China), in which he reported about a meeting that took place with Mao Zedong and [PRC Foreign Minister] Zhou Enlai. During this meeting the question of the necessity of a meeting between Kim Il Sung and Mao Zedong was discussed. Zhou Enlai proposed that the meeting have an official character. Mao, turning toward Ri as if asking when you intend to begin the unification of the country, without waiting for an answer stated that if you intend to begin military operations against the south in the near future, then they should not meet officially. In such a case the trip should be unofficial.Mao Zedong added further that the unification of Korea by peaceful means is not possible, solely military means are required to unify Korea. As regards the Americans, there is no need to be afraid of them. The Americans will not enter a third world war for such a small territory.Kim Il Sung reported further that since Ri Ju-yeon did not have a commission from the Central Committee to meet with Mao Zedong and to discuss questions about his meeting, i.e. Kim Il Sung's, with Mao Zedong, they decided to summon Ri Ju-yeon and give him corresponding rebukes and instructions.Ri Ju-yeon came to Pyongyang and on May 10 left for Beijing with corresponding commissions.Today, May 12, Ri Ju-yeon reported that he met with Mao Zedong, who agreed to the arrival of Kim Il Sung at the time indicated by him. Kim Il Sung reported that they intend to leave for Beijing in the morning of May 13 and asked me if the plane coming for him will be ready by this time. I answered that the plane is ready.Kim Il Sung further reported that they decided to go to China with Pak Heon-yeong, that they have not discussed the question of a meeting with Mao Zedong in the Central Committee, that he has only spoken about this question with Kim Chaek [Kim Chek] (member of the Politburo).Kim Il Sung reported to me that they intend to discuss roughly the following questions with Mao Zedong:1. To inform about their intentions about unifying the country by military means and to report about the results of the discussions on this question in Moscow.2. To exchange opinions on the question of the conclusion of a trade agreement between Korea and China. He intends to propose that they sign a trade agreement in the nearest future, but that they sign an agreement about friendship after the unification of the country.3. To inform Mao about several questions which were placed under discussion with Comrade Stalin in Moscow and about the establishment of closer communications between the Central Committee of the labor party of Korea and the communist party of China.4. To exchange opinions on several questions which interest both Korea and China, such as the electrical station at Supung, Koreans who live in China and so forth.Kim further asked my advice, about what kind of questions he should raise before Mao Zedong from the point of view of assistance in the intended operation. I declined to answer, stating that it is clearer to him, what he has insufficiency in and what the Chinese can help him with. Then Kim Il Sung answered that he intended to ask for ammunition for the Japanese and American arms which the divisions that arrived from China have and for some number of horses. However, after a conversation with the chief of staff of the army, who reported that they have more than 3 b.k. [boekomplekt, standard load of ammunition] of ammunition, he decided not to raise these questions. He stated that he doesn't have more requests for Mao about assistance, since all his requests were satisfied in Moscow and the necessary and sufficient assistance was given him there.Kim Il Sung reported to me that with regard to the question of the preparation of the operation he had given all necessary orders to the chief of the general staff, who already has begun to implement them, that his wish is to begin the operation in June, but he is still not convinced that they will manage it in this period.13 May at 5:20 local time Kim Il Sung and Pak Heon-yeong flew to Beijing.12.V.50 SHTYKOV\n",

      "Cypher. Strictly secret.From PyongyangTo VYSHINSKIIOn May 14 I had a meeting with Kim Il Sung who informed me about the results of the trip of a representative of the CC of the workers’ party of Korea Kim Il (member of the CC, head of the Political Directorate of the Korean People’s Army) to Beijing. Kim Il was sent to China with the aim of establishing contact with the CC of the Chinese Communist party and for talks about the Korean divisions, which are a part of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (meaning the divisions, staffed by Koreans who live in Manchuria). Kim Il, accompanied by the Chinese trade representative in Korea, left Pyongyang on 28 April and on 30 April reached Mukden, where he met with Gao Gang. The latter put Kim Il in touch with the CC of the Chinese Communist party. In Beijing Kim Il had four meetings with Zhu De and Zhou Enlai and one meeting with Mao Zedong. Kim Il passed on to Mao Zedong a letter from the CC of the Korean Workers’ Party with the request, in case it becomes necessary, to transfer Korean divisions that a part of the PLA to the Korean government. Mao Zedong replied that from the three Korean divisions that are a part of the PLA, two divisions are located in Mukden and Changchun, and one division is involved in the offensive operations. Mao Zedong stated that they are prepared at any time to transfer two divisions, located in Manchuria, to the Korean government, completely armed. The third division can be returned from the South only after the end of the fighting but no earlier than in a month’s time. At the same time Mao Zedong warned Kim Il that the aforesaid divisions, as well as their entire army, are not regulars, and are poorly prepared in military terms. He recommended the Koreans to begin military training of the officer corps of these divisions. As the Korean divisions that were being referred to, are armed with Japanese weapons, Kim Il asked Mao Zedong whether the Chinese can later provide help with the ammunition, necessary for the aforementioned divisions. Mao Zedong replied that they manufacture ammunition and can give to the Korean as much as they need. Mao Zedong and Zhu De asked in detail about the situation in Korea. Mao Zedong said that Korea could see military action at any moment; Kim Il Sung must take this into account and thoroughly prepare. In Korea, the war can be of the lightning or the protracted type. A protracted war, Mao Zedong said, it not in your interest, because in this case the Japanese may get involved and provide aid to the South Korean “government.” You don’t need to worry: next to you are the Soviet Union and we in Manchuria. In case it becomes necessary, we can through a few Chinese soldiers over to you; they are all black-[haired], no one will make them out, added Mao Zedong. Mao Zedong asked in detail about the trip of the Korean government delegation to Moscow. He informed Kim Il that the CC CCP received a letter from four Communist parties, including the com[munist] parties of Burma, Malaya, Indochina, with the proposal to create an Inform[ation] Bureau of com[munist] parties of the countries of the East. Mao Zedong was interested whether there was a discussion on this question in Moscow during the trip of the Korean government delegation. Mao Zedong asked about the opinion of the CC of the Korean Workers’ Party on this question. Kim Il replied that he knows nothing about this question but that he will report on this conversation to Kim Il Sung. For his part, Mao Zedong expressed the opinion that the creation of the Informburo is, for now, probably premature, as there is a war going on in China [and] Indochina, the situation is tense in Korea, and the creation of the Informburo can be viewed as the creation of a military alliance. However, Mao Zedong said, this question should be thought through. Mao Zedong expressed the wish to establish more tight ties between the CC CCP and the CC of the Korean Workers’ Party and said that on these questions the Koreans can turn to the secretary of the Northeastern Bureau of the CCP Gao Gang, who is an agent [doverennoe litso] of CC CCP. In conclusion, Kim Il informed Mao Zedong that the CC of the Workers’ Party of Korea intends, upon the establishment of the government of liberated China, to immediately recognize this government and send to China a Korean government delegation headed by Kim Il Sung. Mao Zedong replied that they are not in a hurry to establish a government; they intend to capture Canton [Guangzhou], bring the house in order, and only then form a government. During Kim Il’s last conversation with Zhu De and Zhou Enlai, Zhu De asked Kim Il whether the Soviet comrades are aware about the Koreans’ request regarding the transfer of divisions, and about their opinion. Kim Il replied that he has an instruction of the CC of the Workers’ Party, and the CC, presumably, had a conversation [with the Soviets]. Zhu De was interested in Korea’s economic situation. He said that the Chinese could help Korea with bread and, for their part, asked the Koreans to help China with the fertilizer. On his way back Kim Il met with Gao Gang who informed him that he had already received instructions from Mao Zedong regarding two Korean divisions. Gao Gang expressed a wish to establish contact with Kim Il Sung. Kim Il asked Gao Gang whether he could come to Korea. Gao Gang replied that he can come at any time. Kim Il intends to personally meet Gao Gang at the end of May in Pyongyang. Kim Il Sung informed that Mao Zedong, Zhu De and other CCP leaders were pleased by the arrival of the Korean representative and gave him a very warm and friendly welcome. 15.V.49 Shtykov\n",

      "PyongyangVyshinsky.On September 3 the personal secretary of Kim Il Sung, Mun Il (a Soviet Korean), came to me and at the commission of Kim Il Sung reported that they had received reliable information that in the near future the southerners intend to seize the part of the Ongjin Peninsula which is located to the north of the 38th parallel, and also to bombard the cement plant in the city of Kaisiu.In connection with this, Mun Il said, Kim Il Sung asks permission to begin military operations against the south, with the goal of seizing the Ongjin peninsula and part of the territory of South Korea to the east of the Ongjin Peninsula, approximately to Gaeseong [Kaesong], so as to shorten the line of defense.Kim Il Sung considers, Mun said, that if the international situation permits, they are ready to move further to the south. Kim Il Sung is convinced that they are in a position to seize South Korea in the course of two weeks, maximum 2 months.I asked [Mun] to transmit to Kim Il Sung that this question is very large and serious, it is necessary to think it through carefully and that I therefore urgently recommend to Kim Il Sung not to be in a hurry and not to take [any measures] while there is no decision on this question.Kim Il Sung will probably raise this question again soon.It has been established that the [North] Koreans truly did seize an order to the commander of troops on the Ongjin peninsula to begin artillery fire on the cement plant in Kaisiu on September 2 at 8:00 and to destroy it. From the order it is clear that the southerners consider this plant to be military. The period indicated in the order has past but so far there has been no shelling. The northerners have taken the necessary measures in case of firing on the plant.Regarding the intentions of the southerners to seize part of the Ongjin Peninsula to the north of the 38th parallel, we have only indications [of this] from deserters from the south.There have not been any serious incidents at the 38th parallel since August 15. Small exchanges of fire have taken place, [there have been] instances of artillery firing on the territory of North Korea on the Ongjin Peninsula, trespassing of the parallel. The southerners are carrying out defensive work at the 38th parallel at a faster tempo. I ask your order. 3.9.49   [Charge d'Affaires] Tunkin.\n",

To: MOSCOWMinistry of Foreign Affairs of the USSRTo Comrade GROMYKOInstantsia [Highest Authority]On 29 September I met KIM IL SUNG upon his request.PAK HÒN-YÒNG was present at the meeting. In the beginning of the conversation KIM IL SUNG asked me whether I was aware of the military situation at the front.I replied that I did not know the latest one.Then KIM IL SUNG briefly explained to me the predicament of his troops on the basis of the report of the Front Commander and asked my advice as to what one could do in order to improve the situation at the front. KIM IL SUNG believes that in the wake of the enemy's having occupied the Syarye mountain range and moving into the rear of the Second Army Group the front situation is becoming particularly troublesome. Earlier they hoped that they would be able to withdraw troops in an organized manner. But because of their poor discipline and failure to fulfill orders, the enemy managed to cut off the First Army Group and is moving to cut off the Second Army Group by its breakthrough toward P'UNGGI [BUNKEI] and JIJYON [TISEN].The situation in Seoul is also murky. His orders notwithstanding, CHOE YONG-GEON [Choe Yong Gon] does not report anything, despite the fact that a line of communications with him is available.I replied that it was hard for me to advise anything regarding this matter because I did not know the predicament of the KPA troops and their location, however, I would consider it expedient for KIM IL SUNG to take urgent steps to organize defense along the 38th parallel, including immediate deployment of troops at the already prepared fortifications there.KIM IL SUNG asked me, how do you consider [the situation], will the adversary cross the 38th parallel northward?I replied that it was not clear yet, but that they had to undertake urgent measures to set up defenses along the 38th parallel.KIM IL SUNG reiterated his earlier stated desire to unify the country by his own means, he stated that he wanted to form 15 divisions and to continue the struggle, but it was not clear for him whether the adversary would cross the 38th parallel or not. Should the enemy cross the 38th parallel, they [the North Korean leadership - AM] would be unable to form new troops and they would have no means to render any serious resistance to the enemy.In this connection, he would like to ask my advice regarding his letter to Comrade STALIN. They discussed this idea and want to send the letter.I responded that I could give no advice on this matter. At that moment, PAK HÒN-YÒNG joined the conversation and said that they had already drafted a letter, that the WPKs Political Council had discussed it, and they wanted to familiarize me with its content.I dodged the reading by saying that it was up to the Political Council what its members were going to write in their letter.On 28.9.50, [A.I.] SHABSHIN, a member of MATVEYEV'S group, told MATVEYEV and myself that at a chance meeting with PAK HÒN-YÒNG the latter told him that the Political Council had discussed and adopted a text of the letter addressed to comrade Stalin, containing a request to aid Korea with air support.PAK informed SHABSHIN that they had dispatched a letter in reply to MAO ZEDONG which contained a hint about aid.It was obvious that they [Kim and Pak - AM] were not satisfied with my earlier reply and they did not know what to do with their letter to Comrade STALIN.KIM IL SUNG and PAK HÒN-YÒNG are nervous. In the present difficult situation one can feel some confusion and hopelessness.The military situation has worsened dramatically lately. The adversary managed to cut off the entire First Army Group composed of six divisions and two brigades, as well as, by advancing to the vicinity of CH'ÒGJU, to cut off the Second Army Group composed of 7 divisions. Seoul fell. There are no standby troops ready to render any serious resistance to the enemy advancing to the 38th parallel.New military units being formed in the North advance to the frontline very slowly because the railroads in fact do not function due to the demolished bridges and ruined railway stations, while automobile transport is scarce.These new units lack armaments. The newly formed units and groupings designated to defend CHEMULP'O, HAEJU, WÒNSAN, and CH'ÒNGJIN have weapons designed for training purposes only.The political situation is also getting more and more complicated.The enemy stepped up its activity of dropping paratroopers into the territory of North Korea with the task of gathering intelligence on what deliveries are being shipped from the Soviet Union and to conduct subversive activities.

      "As long as the correspondenceabstract is not an appendix to thedocuments of a given case, it mustbe absolutely destroyed. Top secret!Correspondence abstract No. 3336 [trans. note:  number filled into a preexisting form]from Pyongyang [city filled in] on 19.3.58 [date filled in]Comr. SluczanskiComr. Siedlecki informs us in telegram No. 70 of the 18th of this monthOur 68th.Agenda of the March conference:1. Guidelines of the 5-year plan.2. About the unity and cohesiveness of the party.3. Organizational matters.Re. 1. The fundamental task of the plan is to resolve at least in principle the problems of food, clothing and housing. Heavy industry: to develop above all those of its branches which are tied most closely to the above-mentioned issues. Here, I will give only 2 of the most important problems.a. the construction of machines: to develop also the production of machine tools, with the exception of the more complicated ones,b. in view of the shortage of their own raw materials for the textile industry, to develop the production of synthetic textiles based on cellulose and calcium carbide.  Light industry: as its main task, textiles, shoes, generally broaden the assortment, raise the quality. Construction program: 10 million square meters in the cities and 200 thousand houses in the countryside. The global value of industrial production grows 2.6 times. The minimal crop plan for ’61 is 3 million 760 thousand tons.  Transportation becomes a bottleneck. Because of this, the only factory mentioned during the information [session] was Wonsan, where Poland is helping to organize the production of new train cars. Another plenum will be convened before the summer, devoted to reorganizing trade, which has become another bottleneck in the development of the totality of the economy. Shortly, a session of the parliament [Supreme People’s Assembly] will take place, to make a resolution about the harvest.Kim Il Sung, among other things, stated the 8 basic economic indicators foreseen for 1961 and stated that all, with the exception of steel, are higher than the corresponding indicators for Japan of 1955.” [trans. note: no visible opening quotation marks]Re. 2. Factionalism, particularism, sectarianism, cliquishness led to the closing down of the party long before liberation. In the North, after liberation a battle was fought with this. The defeat of these manifestations of bourgeois ideology is the “main task of our time.” There was no such battle in the South. This is why the party was shattered there during the war, and the further outcomes of this harmful behavior should have been closed down then in the North. Until recently, there existed the belief that there are no revisionists in the DPRK. The August group was a manifestation of revisionism. It is symptomatic that its activity occurred in the period of the reaction’s attacks against the international workers’ movement and against the USSR. From the ideological angle, the factionalists:a. denied the leading role of the party in favor of the Front of National Unity and Trade Un[ions], for example, they assumed that the FNU, and not the party, is the decisive authority for the army. They spoke up against the “excessive interference” of the party in state matters, technology and science.b. They spoke up against the implementation of the dictatorship of the proletariat. They pulled former landowners and kulaks into the state apparatus. In the courts, political crimes were allowed to go unpunished by excusing the guilty with their lack of political upbringing. For example, soldiers’ who escaped to the South.  The conference devoted a lot of attention to the principles of democratic centralism, intra-party discipline and democracy.Re. 3.  The August group was initially viewed as a political faction. Later, it was agreed that there had also been preparations for the use of armed force. At the conference, the principle of overseeing and criticizing sternly and punishing magnanimously was adopted. But treating people in positions of responsibility differently, that is, sternly. In their case, there can be no lack of awareness. The most guilty are to be directed to the court. 9 persons, including Kim Du-bong [Kim Tu Bong] and Pak Ui-wan [Pak Ui Wan], were removed from the CC and the party. In their places, 9 new ones were chosen, including 3 army men: the chief of the political council, the chief of air forces and the leader of the 2nd army. 8 new candidates were chosen, among them the current ambassador to the USSR was chosen. The auditing committee was also fortified. Among others, the vice-minister Ri Dong-geon [Ri Tong Gon] went into it.  Kim Il Sung, chairman of the Central Commission of Party Control, and Ha Ang-cheon [Ha Ang Chon], head of the science department, were brought into the presidium. The issue of fortifying party work in the army was discussed as a separate point. It was decided to introduce party committees in the military.Receiving:Comr. CyrankiewiczComr. GomulkaComr.

He asks about the delegation's trip.Zhou Enlai expresses thanks for the attention and answers that the trip went quite well and that the delegation travelled in full comfort. In the name of Mao Zedong, [he] thanks comrade Stalin, the party CC [Central Committee] and the Soviet government for the enormous help in both the development of the national Chinese economy and in the struggle with its enemies.Stalin. There is no need to thank. This is our duty. Wouldn't the Chinese comrades help us if we were in the same position?Zhou Enlai agrees that this is true, adding that though assistance should be given, gratitude, obviously, should also be expressed.Stalin. We must also thank the Chinese people for carrying on the right struggle. China also helps us by delivering us caoutchouc [natural rubber]. Thus, we will have to thank China as well.Zhou Enlai says that, unfortunately, China's assistance to Soviet Union is insufficient.Stalin. You came to power too late. You were late by more than 30 years.Zhou Enlai asks for permission to set forth the reason for the delegation's visit. Refers to the telegram from Mao Zedong which contains the Chinese government's wishes. States three main topics to be discussed. First question - the situation in Korea. Second - the internal situation within PRC over the past three years and the five year plan for economic development. Notes that a written report is under preparation. The Chinese delegation would like to deal with this question after the report has been presented. Third - the extension of the agreement on Port Arthur.Stalin notes that the initiative to extend the joint use of the military naval base at Port Arthur must come from China. We are guests there, and guests don't ask such questions.Zhou Enlai agrees with comrade Stalin and offers to exchange diplomatic notes. The Chinese government shall address the Soviet government with the necessary request.The next question concerns the construction of the railway from Ulan-Bator to the Sino-Mongol border.Stalin asks whether China is interested in such a railway.Zhou Enlai notes that a railway to Xinjiang would be of greater importance. But that would be a complicated and difficult construction project. The Chinese government is intent on first building a railroad to Mongolia which could then connect to Soviet Union. The length of this railroad on Chinese territory would be approximately 350 km. This railroad is projected to be completed by June 1955. Such a railroad serves Chinese interests as it opens a means of direct rail communication with Soviet Union and eases the receipt of industrial equipment from the USSR to China and the export of Chinese goods to Soviet Union. Stalin responds that a railway to Xinjiang is very important in the long term, and that we could help China build this railway. But this is indeed a long project. If the Chinese comrades are interested in building a railway across Mongolia, we are ready to help in its construction within Mongolian territory. This would be quicker. However, we believe that one cannot lose sight of a Xinjiang railway, since this would be a very important railway which would pass through regions rich in oil. There should be oil there. Mongolia doesn't have much of it. Zhou Enlai notes that there are large deposits of iron ore in the Pinditsiuan region, and that it will become the center of the railroad and steel industries. Right now a plan for the construction of the Xinjiang railway is being drafted. In the course of the first five year plan a railway will be constructed from Lanzhou to Khami. In the second five-year plan a railroad will be built from Khami to the USSR border.Stalin approves of this and reiterates the significance of a Xinjiang railway with respect to prospective oil mining.Zhou Enlai affirms that there are oil deposits all along this route. Moves on to the agreement on hevea [rubber] trees.Stalin indicates that the question has been pretty much decided.Zhou Enlai agrees and shifts to the question of the five year plan for the PRC's economic development. Says that a written report on the subject is under preparation and that, as soon as the report is completed, he would like to visit comrade Stalin and personally go over the report with him.Stalin agrees to this.Zhou Enlai requests assistance for work in geological exploration.Stalin promises such assistance.Zhou Enlai shifts to the question of construction projects for various industrial enterprises in China. Says that there are 151 such enterprises planned to be constructed. Points out that China needs the Soviet Union's help in procuring equipment. Asks that the PRC's written request be considered and that an answer be given as to whether and in what capacity the Soviet Union would render such assistance, and that time periods be specified, and also that Soviet specialists be sent to China. Emphasizes that Soviet specialists working in China have performed a great deal of work and have been of great help to China, especially in the area of training work cadres and specialists. Stalin. That is most important. China must have its own cadres in order to stand strong on its own feet.Zhou Enlai informs that they would like to receive an additional 800 specialists from Soviet Union. Stalin says that this request will be examined and that we will try to send as many as we can.Zhou Enlai asks also for assistance with technical documentation (blueprints, etc.).Stalin answers that this is, indeed, necessary.Zhou Enlai asks if it will be possible to continue to educate students in the USSR and to send interns to Soviet enterprises. Stalin expresses agreement.Zhou Enlai touches on the question of the military five year plan. Informs that materials are under preparation and that a written report will be presented. Also wishes to receive military equipment.Stalin asks what Zhou Enlai has in mind: shipments of weapons or equipment for military factories.Zhou Enlai says that he meant shipments of weapons. Noting that since agreement has already been expressed with regard to weapons for 60 divisions, he would like to discuss shipments for naval forces. Asks what sort of assistance could be received in the way of airplanes.Stalin asks whether the Chinese government is thinking of building aero-manufacturing plants.Zhou Enlai says that this would be very difficult to do in the course of the first five year plan, particularly with regard to jet airplanes. Notes that such construction is not planned to begin until at least 5 years from now, and motor-building - in 3 years.Stalin points to the example of Czechoslovakia and Poland, which began with assembly plants. Says that the USSR could send China motors and other airplane parts, and China could organize the assembly of these airplanes. Cadres can be trained in this way. We went through the same process. Such a process would be more beneficial for Chinese comrades as well. First you must build 1-2 factories for motor assembly. We will send motors and other airplane parts which would then be assembled in China. That's how it was done in Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary. This ought to be organized. Having organized assembly plants, you could then, in another 3 years, build an airplane factory. That is the easiest and the best way.Zhou Enlai says that they are beginning to understand this and are organizing maintenance and assembly plants. He adds that if comrade Stalin finds it necessary to hasten the process, then they will take all appropriate measures to comply.Stalin asks whether divisions of some sort have been organized in order to receive the shipment of weapons for 60 divisions which Soviet Union sent to China. Zhou Enlai explains that out of the 10 divisions' worth of armaments that China has received, 3 have been given over to Korea and 7 have been earmarked for Chinese detachments in Korea.Stalin asks if he understands correctly that all of the weapons will go to the Korean front. Zhou Enlai affirms that it will be so, assuming that the war will continue. Informs that, out of the total of 60 divisions' armaments, the Chinese government is intent on sending 3 to Korea, preparing 42 divisions [of Chinese soldiers] to serve in Korea ..... [ellipsis in original]Stalin asks whether the Chinese have gotten used to the new weapons.Zhou Enlai explains that they are gradually becoming proficient with the new weapons, with 3-4 months of training.Stalin. Under these circumstances we operate in a way so as to allow soldiers to become familiar with the weapons and the overall organization of the division. This takes time - approximately 6 months. Without it one could lose the weapons. Besides, during this time we inspect the operation of various mechanisms, and only then do we send these units to the front. Of course this preparation could be carried out behind the front, in Korea, for example. Half of the divisions receiving the new weapons should remain in China.Zhou Enlai notes that the shipment of divisions to Korea results in losses, which must be made up. Stalin emphasizes that it is imperative to train the divisions, so as to make them stronger.Zhou Enlai raises the question of assistance with artillery.Stalin asks whether China can produce ammunition.Zhou Enlai answers that they have not yet addressed this question.Stalin notes that, all in all, it is more difficult to transport ammunition than artillery pieces.Zhou Enlai repeats his request for assistance with artillery. Emphasizes that for every Chinese shell fired, the Americans answer with 9 shells of their own. Stalin. That's bad. Adds that if the Americans are firing 9 shells, the Chinese should be firing 20. We smothered the Germans with artillery. We had a gun stationed every 2 meters, while the Germans had a gun every kilometer. Artillery is important stuff. The Chinese government needs to get the munitions production going. We will help you build these factories.Zhou Enlai points out that they are reorganizing existing factories and are planning new factories.Stalin. That is necessary. Machine tools are of utmost importance here.Zhou Enlai says that they have machine tools, but old ones.Stalin says that machine tools are essential in the production of ammunition for 122mm, three-inch and anti-aircraft guns. We can help in this matter. Adds that it is not necessary to build large factories. We build ammunition in different plants: one plant makes shell casings while another loads them. It's difficult to do everything in one factory.Zhou Enlai announces that the Chinese government will act upon the advice of the Soviet government regarding its aviation industry and take all measures to further its development. Stalin emphasizes the importance of first organizing assembly plants.Zhou Enlai says that the Chinese government plans to build tank-producing factories: one for light tanks with an output of 1 thousand tanks per year, and another for medium tanks, to be completed in 4-5 years.Stalin advises to start here with assembly plans as well, pointing out that during the war we converted automobile factories to produce tanks. Says that it would be good for China to have 1-2 auto assembly plants.Zhou Enlai says that they plan to build a factory in Changchun with an output of 20 thousand cars and are organizing an assembly plant with an output of 3 thousand cars a year. Asks for assistance in the planning of yet another factory.Stalin emphasizes that cadres must receive training in assembly and maintenance factories. This issue must be addressed.Zhou Enlai agrees completely with this observation and notes that the Chinese government is addressing this matter. They have maintenance factories and are currently working to organize assembly plants; these plants will open next year.Stalin inquires whether China has worker education schools in their factories. Adds that we have such a school in every factory.Zhou Enlai admits that this is one of the weaker spots. They are taking measures to rectify the situation. There are courses given in factories. They are trying to attract students and are selecting party members to teach.Stalin points out that we have a special ministry, the Ministry of Labor Resources. There are vocational schools. It would be good for China to establish something of the sort. Every year these schools graduate around 1 million. young workers.Zhou Enlai asks, what sort of institutions does Soviet Union have to train middle management cadres[?]Stalin explains that there are special technical schools for this purpose.Zhou Enlai says that he would like to discuss the question of radar.Stalin promises to assist in this matter. Radio and radar are very important.Zhou Enlai says that they were thinking of building assembly plants for this purpose.Stalin emphasizes that subsequently they should build radar equipment manufacturing plants.Zhou Enlai says that so far they are not capable of producing radar equipment.Stalin promises to help.Zhou Enlai returns to the question of specialists. Says that the Chinese government does not intend merely to ask us for help with specialists but also plans to prepare its own specialists.Stalin approves of this, pointing out that, in time, other countries will ask China for specialists: India, Burma, Indo-China. Adds that it would be wiser for the Chinese government to send engineers and technicians to Soviet factories, where they could hone their skills.Zhou Enlai raises the question of defraying the costs that China bears from the trade imbalance between the two countries. Says that the Chinese government would like to ask for a new loan. However, observes Zhou Enlai, we understand that this would be a burden for the Soviet Union.Stalin points out that this is because we came to power earlier, that we were lucky. If the Chinese comrades had come to power before us, then we would have had to ask the same of them.To this Zhou Enlai responds that Moscow is the center from which all nations derive inspiration for their struggle for liberation.He goes on to give a short account of the situation in Korea. He points out that up until May 1951 the war in Korea was not static, but was a war of movement. Since May 1951, a front has been established, and the war has become static. Both sides are about equal in strength. The enemy is in no position to carry out an offensive. There is a certain equilibrium. But we are not carrying out large offensives, either. Like the enemy which has reinforced its position 15-20 km. deep, so have we created our own fortified zone, and continue to dig even now. The enemy has not been able to destroy our fortifications. The front line extends for about 200 km and is completely fortified, as are the left and right flanks. Mao Zedong has put forth three questions. First - will we be able to repulse the enemy? We are convinced that we will. Second - will we be able to hold our present positions? This year has shown that we will be able to hold and strengthen our positions. Third - will we be able to carry out an offensive, to attack the enemy? Earlier we thought that we would hardly be able to carry out an offensive for more than 7 days. Now we are sufficiently strong to launch longer offensives and have entrenched ourselves well enough to withstand bombing raids.Stalin asks whether they are capable of widening the scope of the offensives.Zhou Enlai explains that they can launch offensives to capture isolated positions, but a general offensive would be difficult to carry out. Since the war acquired its static nature, the American command has been intent on drawing out the negotiations and is not interested in signing a truce.Stalin says that apparently the Americans want to keep more Chinese POWs. That would explain their refusal to return POWs. Perhaps they turned them over to Chiang Kai-shek [Jiang Jieshi].Zhou Enlai affirms that there are agents of Chiang Kai-shek among the POWs.Stalin observes that Americans want to decide the POW question on their own, in defiance of all international laws. Under international law the warring sides are obligated to return all POWs, except those convicted of crimes. What does Mao Zedong think regarding this matter: will he give in or will he hold his own?Zhou Enlai briefly relates the differences that separate them and the [North] Korean comrades in this matter. America has agreed to return 83 thousand POWs, and [North] Korea was ready to accept the offer. However, they have not considered the crafty game that America is playing here - out of the 83 thousand, only 6400 are Chinese, and the rest Koreans. In truth, they are supposed to return another 13,600 Chinese volunteers, but the Americans don't want to do this, though they are quite willing to return 76 thousand Koreans. This clearly shows that they are out to provoke us, by trying to drive a wedge between China and [North] Korea.Stalin asks how many Korean POWs are there.Zhou Enlai answers - 96,600. Emphasizes that the question of the number of Chinese and Korean POWs supposed to be returned is a matter of principle. Informs that the Chinese government is firmly committed on having all 116 thous. POWs, including 20 thous. Chinese, returned. But if Americans were to agree on returning a few less, then we would not strongly object, if [they] promised that negotiations for the return of the other POWs will continue. Stalin affirms that this is the right position.Zhou Enlai informs that Mao Zedong, having analyzed the current situation regarding this matter, believes that one should stand firmly committed on the return of all POWs. The [North] Koreans believe that the continuation of the war is not advantageous because the daily losses are greater than the number of POWs whose return is being discussed. But ending the war would not be advantageous to the USA. Mao Zedong believes that the continuation of the war is advantageous to us, since it detracts USA from preparing for a new world war. Stalin. Mao Zedong is right. This war is getting on America's nerves. The North Koreans have lost nothing, except for casualties that they suffered during the war. Americans understand that this war is not advantageous and they will have to end it, especially after it becomes clear that our troops will remain in China. Endurance and patience is needed here. Of course, one needs to understand Korea - they have suffered many casualties. But they need to be explained that this is an important matter. They need patience and lots of endurance. The war in Korea has shown America's weakness. The armies of 24 countries cannot continue the war in Korea for long, since they have not achieved their goals and cannot count on success in this matter. Koreans need our help and support.Asks about the bread situation in Korea. Says that we can help them.Zhou Enlai says that Korea is having difficulties in this regard. The Chinese government knows that USSR has helped Korea. Says that they have also helped Korea and have told Kim Il Sung that this is not an obstacle, that they will give them foodstuffs and clothing and everything they ask for, but that they cannot give weapons. Stalin says that we can give Korea additional weapons. We will begrudge nothing to Korea.Zhou Enlai repeats that they cannot yield to the Americans during the negotiations.Stalin observes that if the Americans back down a little, then you can accept, assuming that negotiations will continue on questions still unresolved.Zhou Enlai agrees, adding that if the Americans don't want peace, then we must be prepared to continue the war, even if it were to take another year.Stalin affirms that this is correct.Zhou Enlai emphasizes the truth of comrade Stalin's observations, namely that this war is getting on America's nerves and that the USA is not ready for the world war. Adds that China, by playing the vanguard role in this war, is helping to stave off the war for 15-20 years, assuming that they will succeed in containing the American offensive in Korea. Then the USA will not be able to unleash a third world war at all. Stalin says that this is true, but with one stipulation: Americans are not capable of waging a large-scale war at all, especially after the Korean war. All of their strength lies in air power and the atom bomb. Britain won't fight for America. America cannot defeat little Korea. One must be firm when dealing with America. The Chinese comrades must know that if America does not lose this war, then China will never recapture Taiwan. Americans are merchants. Every American soldier is a speculator, occupied with buying and selling. Germans conquered France in 20 days. It's been already two years, and USA has still not subdued little Korea. What kind of strength is that? America's primary weapons, says comrade Stalin jokingly, are stockings, cigarettes, and other merchandise. They want to subjugate the world, yet they cannot subdue little Korea. No, Americans don't know how to fight. After the Korean war, in particular, they have lost the capability to wage a large-scale war. They are pinning their hopes on the atom bomb and air power. But one cannot win a war with that. One needs infantry, and they don't have much infantry; the infantry they do have is weak. They are fighting with little Korea, and already people are weeping in the USA. What will happen if they start a large-scale war? Then, perhaps, everyone will weep. Zhou Enlai states that if America makes some sort of compromises, even if they are small, then they should accept. If America does not agree to return all POWs and proposes a smaller number, then they should accept the offer, under the condition that the question of the remaining POWs will be resolved under mediation by some neutral country, like India, or the remaining POWs transferred to this neutral country until the question is resolved. Stalin asks how many American POWs there are.Zhou Enlai explains that the overall number of POWs in North Korean and Chinese hands is 12,000, out of which 7,400 are South Koreans. Stalin does not exclude such a resolution to the question, as proposed by Zhou Enlai. On his part, [he] proposes that they could announce to the Americans that if they are holding back a certain percentage of Korean and Chinese POWs, then North Korea and China will hold back the same percentage of South Korean and American POWs until a final solution to the POW question is agreed upon. This needs to be tried as a way of pressuring Americans by publicizing it in the press. If America rejects this offer, then it should be declared that they apparently want to send Chinese POWs to Chiang Kai-shek. If these proposals are unsuccessful, then you can resort to mediation. The main thing here is to propose a ceasefire.Zhou Enlai declares that, indeed, an armistice agreement also involves a cease-fire. On the POW question [he] enumerates three positions. First - announce from the beginning that they will hold back the same percentage of South Korean and American POWs as the percentage of North Koreans and Chinese held back by America, and leave it at that. Second - resort to mediation by a neutral country. Third - sign an armistice agreement by putting off the POW question and resuming its discussion afterwards.Then Zhou Enlai returned to the question of military assistance and put forth the Korean comrades' request for 10 anti-aircraft gun regiments. We told the Koreans that we don't have such capabilities, but that we would bring this up with the Soviet government. Stalin. Kim Il Sung asked as for 5 regiments. We promised to send him these. Perhaps China will also give 5 regiments?Zhou Enlai repeats that they do not have such capabilities and that this is new to them.Stalin says that this question needs to be cleared up with Kim Il Sung.As for Zhou Enlai's request to send 10 regiments, irrespective of those promised earlier, comrade Stalin answers that it will have to be examined.Zhou Enlai brings up the Korean comrades' request for advice on whether they should start bombing South Korea. They are not sure whether it's the right way to go.Stalin explains that the air force belongs to the state and that Chinese volunteers should not use state planes.Zhou Enlai informs that the Korean comrades have asked about launching a new offensive, to which the Chinese government replied that they cannot carry out a strategic offensive.Stalin points out that when armistice negotiations are taking place, they should not be launching either strategic or tactical offensives. They shouldn't be launching any offensives.Zhou Enlai asks, referring to Mao Zedong's question whether Kim Il Sung and [Chinese military commander] Peng Dehuai should be invited to Moscow.Stalin. I would happily talk to them, but they are far away. Besides, we are not very comfortable with inviting them. If they were to bring up the question, then we would happily welcome them here.Zhou Enlai informs that Peng Dehuai would very much like to come, though he is unsure of what Kim Il Sung thinks. Perhaps it would be good to speak to them about this.Stalin agrees.Zhou Enlai repeats that the Chinese government believes that it is wise to continue the negotiations in Panmunjom. But China is preparing for the possibility of another 2-3 years of war. Again asks for assistance with aviation, artillery, and ammunition, as China cannot deal with these matters on its own. Stalin announces that everything we can give you, we will. Asks how is the Korean morale. Is there confusion?Zhou Enlai explains that, indeed, there has been much destruction in Korea, especially after the bombing of the electric power station on the Yalu river. This has had an impact on Korean morale and on their efforts to accelerate the struggle to achieve peace.Stalin says that the American strategy is fright. But they have not frightened China. Could it be said that they have also failed to frighten Korea?Zhou Enlai affirms that one could essentially say that.Stalin. If that is true, then it's not too bad.Zhou Enlai adds that Korea is wavering somewhat. They are in a slightly unsteady state. Among certain elements of the Korean leadership one can detect a state of panic, even.Stalin reminds that he has been already informed of these feelings through Kim Il Sung's telegram to Mao Zedong.Zhou Enlai confirms this.Asks how should the Chinese delegation proceed further.Stalin proposes to start work immediately. Informs that Soviet Union has assigned a commission under the chairmanship of comrade Molotov and consisting of comrs. Bulganin, Mikoyan, Vyshinskii and Kumykin, and that the Chinese delegation can speak to Molotov about when to start work.Zhou Enlai expresses thanks for the information and asks comrade Stalin to name the time when he can brief comrade Stalin on the internal situation in the PRC.Stalin agrees to see Zhou Enlai as soon as he receives a finished version of the written report.Transcribed byA.Vyshinskii [signature]N.Fedorenko [signature]\n",

      "8th Department of the General Staff of theArmed Forces of the USSRCIPHERED TELEGRAM No. 75021Pyongyang Soviet Ambassador.Verbally transmit the following to Kim Il Sung. If he demands it in written form—give it to him in written form, but without my signature.1. The CC VKP(b) [Central Committee, All-Union Communist Party (bolshevik)] salutes Comrade Kim Il Sung and his friends for the great liberational struggle of the Korean people which comrade Kim Il Sung is leading with brilliant success. CC VKP(b) has no doubt that in the soonest time the interventionists will be driven out of Korea with ignominy.2. Comrade Kim Il Sung should not be embarrassed by the fact that he does not have solid successes in the war against the interventionists, that the successes are sometimes interrupted by delays in the advance or even by some local set-backs. In such a war continuous successes do not occur. The Russians also did not have continuous successes during the civil war and even more during the war with Germany. The greatest success of the Korean people is that Korea has now become the most popular country in the world and has turned into the banner of the movement in Asia for liberation from the imperialist yoke. The armies of all enslaved peoples will now learn from the Korean People's Army the art of bringing decisive blows to the Americans and to any imperialists. Moreover, Comrade Kim Il Sung should not forget that Korea is not alone now, that it has allies, who are rendering and will render it aid. The position of the Russians during the Anglo-French-American intervention in 1919 was several times worse than the position of the Korean comrades at the present time.3. Advise Comrade Kim Il Sung not to scatter the air force, but to concentrate it on the front. It is necessary that each attack by the People's Army on any portion of the front begin with a number of decisive blows by attack planes on the troops of the enemy, that the fighter planes defend the troops of the Peoples Army from the blows of the enemy planes as much as possible. If it is necessary, we can throw in additional assault aircraft and fighter aircraft for the Korean air force.Feng Xi [Stalin]28 August 1950No. 483/shCopy No. 1 To Stalin\n",

      "BEIJINGTo the Main Military Adviserfor Comrade MAO ZEDONGComrade Mao Zedong!We have received your telegram of 17 December.Your observations regarding the probability of an attack by the Americans in the spring of 1953 reflect the plans of the present American command in Korea, who are operating under the leadership of the Truman government. It is fully possible that these plans will be changed by the Eisenhower government in the direction of less tension on the front in Korea. Nevertheless, you are acting correctly when you count on the worst and proceed from the probability of an attack by the Americans.We have reviewed your application for military goods for 1953 and the application for urgently needed military goods.The quantity of arms, ammunition and other military goods which you requested oversteps the limits of our possibilities in 1953. Our calculations are based on the fact that we must deliver to you in 1953 arms, ammunition and other goods for 20 infantry divisions, this means that we must deliver for each of 20 divisions around 800,000 [units of] ammunition, 1320 artillery pieces of various types and other goods.Taking into account the situation you speak of in your telegram, with great difficulty we can deliver to you in 1953, besides the arms and ammunition for 20 divisions [already] earmarked, with equal shipments until the end of the year, approximately one-fourth of the quantity you stated in your telegram of 17 December, specifically: 600,000 pieces of ammunition, 332 pieces of artillery of various types, tractor artillery, detonating fuses and other goods; the amounts of the deliveries of each will be determined by our War Ministry.Thus, with a calculation of the arms and ammunition being delivered for 20 infantry divisions in 1953, there will be shipped to you: 1400 pieces of ammunition, as opposed to the 1,125,000 delivered in 1952, 1652 pieces of artillery of various types, as opposed to 1056 guns delivered in 1952.As regards the applications for materials for military production mentioned in your telegram, transmitted to us by Minister of Foreign Trade Comrade Ye Jizhuang--this application is now being studied by our Ministry of Foreign Trade.SEMENOV [Stalin].27 December 1952\n",

      "8th Administration of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the USSRCIPHERED TELEGRAM No. 100269To Comrade RAZUVAEV.Discuss the following telegram with Comrade Kim Il Sung and his closest friends and communicate their opinion. 1. It is possible to consider it incontestable that the present [North] Korean divisions are less battle capable than the old divisions in the summer of last year. This is explained by the fact that the Koreans had 10 divisions, well fitted out with officer corps and more or less satisfactorily trained. And now the Koreans have 28 divisions, of which 19 divisions are at the front and 9 are in Manchuria. It is clear that the Koreans are not in a position to supply such a large number of divisions with officer corps. According to our norms, each division, having, let's say, 8,000 men must have at least 800 officers, not counting sergeants. I have in mind the genuine officers, capable of cementing a division, and not hastily commissioned officers. It is clear that the Koreans still don't have such a number of officers. Therefore the present Korean officers are understrength, unstable and little capable of battle. The Koreans increased the number of divisions and forgot about quality, but quality plays the decisive role here.2. It would be advisable in the given situation to have not more than 23 divisions in the Korean army, so that the officer corps of the reduced 5 divisions can be used to fill out the officer corps of the remaining weak divisions, and the rank and file to use as reinforcement. This will strengthen the divisions, lessen the expenses and make for a gain in arms. The same needs to be said regarding the four Korean infantry brigades which are in poorly combat readiness and which also can be used to fill out the divisions with officers and rank and file.3. At this stage the organization of corps administration is inadvisable, since there are no, or almost no, commanders capable of leading the corps, but there are already army apparatuses. It would be better to organize the 5 army administrations with 4 divisions in each army, so that the army apparatus itself directly commands its divisions. In this case the Korean armed forces would have in its composition 5 armies (in all 20 divisions), and 3 divisions could be in the reserve of the main command for assisting the most needy armies according to the course of the operation. With time, when the commanders mature, when there will be enough of them and when they learn to command joint divisions, then it will be possible to transfer to a corps system.Of course, this reform should not be carried out now, but during a time of rest after conducting the operation.Discuss these proposals and communicate your opinion.30 Jan 1951FENG XI [FYN SI; Stalin]No. 4/854Copies: Stalin, Vasilevsky, Shtemenko[...]\n",

      "COPY OF AN OUTGOING TELEGRAM Copy Nº 1CABLE Nº 4277 to Cde. MAO ZEDONGWe have received your cipher message of 20 July. We consider your point of view about not insisting any more on including in the agenda the point about the withdrawal of foreign troops to be correct. The point about the withdrawal of foreign troops has been sufficiently well used by you in the negotiations to demonstrate your peacefulness on the one hand and the American reluctance to expedite the matter of peace on the other. Now this point can be deferred to another time without damage to the cause and it can be agreed not to include it in the agenda.21 July 1951 FILIPPOV---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- One copy printed - to Cde.

      "CIPHERED TELEGRAM No. 3410BEIJINGTO KRASOVSKYFOR Comrade MAO ZEDONGI received your telegram of June 4, and also the two directives of Comrade Peng Dehuai.I also think, as do you, that the war in Korea should not be speeded up, since a drawn out war, in the first place, gives the possibility to the Chinese troops to study contemporary warfare on the field of battle and in the second place shakes up the Truman regime in America and harms the military prestige of the Anglo-American troops.In my telegram I wrote mainly about the fact that it is risky to conduct maneuvers if there are no strong defensive fortifications in the rear, to which the main forces could be quickly withdrawn. Comrade Peng Dehuai writes that he is creating three defensive lines in the rear. If this is done and the defensive lines are truly serious, then the affair will proceed in a better way and the troops will not fall into encirclement.You complain that you have little artillery, antitank guns and other arms. I communicated to you two months ago that the Poles have retracted their orders and we therefore could make for you additional deliveries of arms in this year, thus increasing the volume of military credit for 1951. Comrade Zhou Enlai welcomed this report of mine and told us that you will soon send new applications. However, there are no new applications from you. Why is this? How is this explained? Again I communicate to you that we could make new deliveries of artillery for you if you want this.Comrade Peng Dehuai is right that it is necessary to strengthen the operations of partisan detachments in the enemy's rear. This is absolutely necessary.Comrade Peng Dehaui writes about the presence of a relatively high fighting spirit among the Anglo-American troops, and about the fact that \"serious rightist moods\" have appeared among the Chinese troops. In my opinion this is explained by the fact that your local maneuvers with some forward advance but then a falling back, repeated several times, create among your troops the impression of weakness of Chinese and Koreans, but create among the Anglo- American troops the impression of their might. I fear that this situation can undermine the spirit of the Chinese-Korean troops. I think that it will not be possible to crush these unhealthy moods unless you prepare and carry out a serious blow to the enemy with the defeat of three to four enemy divisions. This would lead to a serious turnaround in the moods of the Chinese-Koreans as well as among the Anglo-American troops. This, of course, will not be broad and far from being an offensive, will be only a serious short blow against the enemy, but this will be the kind of blow that will sober up the enemy and raise the fighting spirit of the Chinese-Korean troops. Moreover this would give you the possibility of undertaking then wider and more successful local maneuvers needed to exhaust the enemy.FILIPPOV [Stalin]No. 297/sh5 June 1951\n",

      "CIPHERED TELEGRAM No. 3557BEIJING, TO ROSHCHINDeliver immediately to the addressee.“To Comrade MAO ZEDONG.Today there was a conversation with your representatives from Manchuria and Korea [Gao Gang and Kim Il Sung]. Three questions were raised:First—about an armistice. We recognized that an armistice is now advantageous.Second—about military advisers. If they are very necessary to you, then we are ready to satisfy you.Third—about the delivery of arms for sixteen divisions. There will not be objections from our side.I won't write about the details, since your representatives will report to you about them.We consider it absolutely necessary now to start moving at least eight fighter aviation divisions from the sixteen Chinese divisions. We think that besides two or three aviation divisions of MIG-15s, you could take to the front from central and southern China five or six divisions of MIG-9's, which operate very effectively against bombers. Eight fighter divisions on your front could fully satisfy the needs of the front. According to our information your pilots are already ready to fly. It is necessary to put them into battle more quickly, so that they will be not paper pilots, but battle pilots. We trained our pilots for action at the front in five months. Seven to eight months of training is fully sufficient for the Chinese pilots. We consider this to be the main question now for your front. After the end of the conversation we received information that the Anglo-Americans intend to appeal soon to you and to the Koreans in the name of the sixteen nations fighting against Korea with a proposal about an armistice. But before making this proposal they want to strike a blow against our troops. It is possible that these are merely rumors, but it is fully possible and probable that these are not merely rumors, but corresponds to reality. We therefore advise you to hold tight the line of defense and not allow the enemy to advance.FILIPPOV [Stalin].”For Roshchin.We ask you to familiarize Krasovsky with this telegram. We are sending him a special directive.FILIPPOVNo. 302/sh\n",

      "CIPHERED TELEGRAM No. 3559BEIJINGTO KRASOVSKYAccording to our information, our pilots are training the Koreans very slowly and in a slipshod manner. You and General Belov apparently intend to make professors rather than battle pilots out of the Chinese pilots. We consider this to be overcautiousness on the side of our aviation specialists. If Russian pilots were trained during the war in five to six months, then why is it impossible to complete the training of Chinese pilots in seven to eight months? Isn't it time to throw away this harmful overcautiousness? The Chinese troops will not fight without air cover. Therefore it is necessary to create more quickly a group of eight Chinese air fighter divisions and send them to the front. This is now your main task.Belov can send one division closer to the Chinese border in Manchuria, and two divisions can be held in the rear in North Korea, thus freeing up two airports for the Chinese fighter divisions closer to the front. This is absolutely necessary. It is necessary to arrange matters so that the Chinese rely only on their own aviation at the front.Report the fulfillment.FILIPPOV [Stalin]No. 303/sh\n",

      "CIPHERED TELEGRAM No. 3777BEIJING - Comrade KRASOVSKYFor Comrade MAO ZEDONGWe received your telegram of June 21.1. You must already know from [Soviet ambassador to the UN Jacob] Malik's speech that our promise about raising the question of an armistice has already been fulfilled by us. It is possible that the matter of an armistice will move forward.2. As concerns arms for 60 divisions then I must say to you directly that to fulfill this application in the course of a single year is physically impossible and altogether unthinkable. Our production and military specialists consider it completely impossible to give arms for more than 10 divisions in the course of 1951. The fulfillment of the application for 60 divisions is possible, and at that with great difficulty, only in the course of 1951, '52, '53 and the first half of '54, i.e. in the course of three years. Such is the final opinion of our production and military specialists. I have tried in every way to shorten these periods even if by a half year, but unfortunately upon examination it has turned out that this is impossible.I will communicate about all this in more detail in a separate telegram and also about the staff-organizational structure of the present Chinese divisions.FILIPPOV [Stalin]24 June 1951No. 635177[....]\n",

      "CIPHERED TELEGRAM No. 3821BEIJING - TO KRASOVSKYWe have received the following telegram from Mao Zedong:“The government of the Chinese People's Republic intends to send fighter divisions armed with MIG-15s to Korea for participation in the military actions, which will be much better than sending divisions armed with MIG-9 planes. It is therefore necessary in the course of one and a half to two months to retrain the 6th, 12th and 14th fighter divisions, which are armed with MIG- 9s, on MIG-15s, with a calculation of sending them to the front in September 1951.The government of the Chinese People's Republic asks you to give an order to the Soviet comrades in China to retrain the 6th, 12th and 14th fighter divisions on MIG-15s in the indicated periods.” As is obvious, Mao Zedong does not want to take MIG-9s from the Chinese airports for transfer to the front, but prefers to leave them in place, and to use at the front only MIG-15 divisions. Speak with Mao Zedong, and if our supposition is confirmed, tell him that your people will begin the retraining of Chinese pilots now flying MIG-9s for flights on MIG-15s. It seems to us that this does not require two months, but if the Chinese insist, then train them in the course of two months. Report the fulfillment.FILIPPOV [Stalin]26 June 1951\n",

The entire course of the negotiations for some time past shows that although the Americans are dragging out the negotiations, they nonetheless are more in need of rapidly concluding them. This is based on the overall international situation.We consider it correct that the Chinese/ Korean side, using flexible tactics in the negotiations, continues to pursue a hard line, not showing haste and not displaying interest in a rapid end to the negotiations.We consider your position on the definition of the line of demarcation and the establishment of monitoring in one or two border points to be correct. We also agree with you about the composition of the commission for the fulfillment of monitoring functions.Your position on the question of an exchange of prisoners of war is completely correct and it will be difficult for the opponent to dispute it.As regards the possible variants of convening a conference for the further resolution of the Korean question after the conclusion of an armistice, it seems to us that it would be more expedient to convene a conference of political representatives of both sides which are presently conducting the negotiations, with the obligatory participation of representatives of North and South Korea.FILIPPOV [Stalin]19 November 1951[A copy of the telegram sent to Beijing in found in APRF, Fond 45, Opis 1, Delo 342, List 23.]\n",

      "8th Department of the General Staff of the Armed Forces USSRCIPHERED TELEGRAM No. 75835To Comrade SHTYKOVfor Comrade KIM IL SUNGI have received your telegram about the preparation of pilot cadres after a delay which was the fault of the Soviet apparatus.In the opinion of our military this question is more expediently resolved in the following manner:1. To organize the preparation of 200-300 pilots from Korean students, in the flight school already existing in YANTSZY on the territory of MANCHURIA. An additional contingent of Soviet instructors will be given for this.2. The preparation of pilots for two jet fighter regiments can be organized at one of our jet divisions of MIG-15's located in MANCHURIA. After the preparation of the pilots, the appropriate number of MIG-15 planes will be delivered.With regard to the preparation of pilots for one bomber regiment, it is more convenient to prepare them in the Korean school we have in the Far East Maritime Region. The materiel, TU-2 planes for the bomber regiment, will also be given.3. We agree to accept an additional 120 men in the Korean pilot school that we have in the Far East Maritime Region, to train them as technicians and crew for attack planes.4. It is better that the Korean pilots receive flight training in the place where they will study, i.e. in MANCHURIA or in our Maritime Region.If you agree with these proposals, corresponding orders will be given to our military command.FYN SI [Stalin].No. 4/755620 November 1950Copies: Bulganin, Shtemenko, Stalin.\n",

      "[...]To be returned after 6 daysTop Secret8 Department of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Union SSR.CIPHERED TELEGRAM # 753521 October 1950  To Pyongyang  SHTRAUS [pseudonym for Soviet Amb. Shtykov], MAYVEYEV [pseudonym for M.V. Zakharov, Stalin’s personal military envoy]We have received your cable of 30 September and 1 October. These cables show that cde. KIM IL SUNG and other comrades from the Korean leadership pose before you a set of questions and that you dodge these questions. We consider your behavior to be erroneous. In the emerging grave situation it is natural for Korean comrades to solicit advice and assistance, but cde. SHTYKOV keeps silent and thus contributes to the sense of uncertainty in the Korean leadership. Cde. MAYVEYEV was sent to Korea not for transmitting summaries on the events in Korea, which we kept receiving anyway. Until now he has not yet presented to Moscow [authorities] his detailed assessment of the military situation in Korea, not to mention any suggestions or advice that may flow out of this situation. Thereby he makes it more difficult for us to take this or that decision on the Korean matters. Cde. MAYVEYEV does little to assist the Korean leadership which is revealed by the fact that the Korean leadership still lacks any plan of defense of the republic along the 38th parallel and Northbound, and does not have a plan of withdrawal of troops from South Korea.Keep these directions in mind in your subsequent activities in Korea.Immediately visit KIM IL SUNG and PAK HEON-YEONG [Pak Hon Yong] and tell them the following:First. Will the enemy advance to the North of the 38th parallel? We should base ourselves in this question on the worst-case scenario, that is, that the enemy will try to capture North Korea. Therefore one should without delay mobilize all forces and prevent the enemy from crossing the 38th parallel, that is, to be prepared to fight the enemy to the North of the 38th parallel.We should not underestimate the strength and capabilities of the Korean republic in the matters of organizing defense. There is a big potential and resources for mobilization in the Korean North. Under the present difficult circumstances one should at any cost and in the shortest possible time resolve the task of creating combat-ready armed forces, both through reinforcement of the existing troops as well as through formation of new ones. We will fully supply all these troops with armaments.We hold as erroneous the opinion that North Korea cannot offer resistance along the 38th parallel and to the North of it. The Korean government possesses forces, it only should organize them and utilize all resources for defense. It must do everything to speed up formation of divisions and units - the armaments for them are already on the way to Korea. At the same time it is necessary to take more energetic measures towards withdrawal of troops from the South, having in mind that there is no solid front-line in the South, therefore troops have good chances to reach the North. This matter should be done in a hurry, for the Americans will certainly attempt to deprive the troops of this possibility in the nearest future.Second. In the South, behind the enemy's lines, one should make transition to guerilla warfare, in the shortest period of time to develop energetic guerilla  activities, using to this goal, along with the guerilla fighters from the local population, the remaining armed units when they advance to the North is precluded. The guerillas should have a task - to disrupt and terrorize the area behind the enemy's lines by disrupting roads [kommunikatsii], destroying headquarters and lines of communications, attacking the enemy's officers and soldiers and through other active measures. Third. The emerging situation requires firm leadership and its restructuring [perestroiki] in the light of new tasks of organization of sturdy defense. To this end one needs, above all, to put an end to the existing mood of uncertainty in the leadership, to define sharply and strictly the duties of the leading comrades by assigning to each one specific tasks and responsibilities on select issues of the country's defense. With merciless and immediate measures one must break the neck of the reaction and ensure order behind the frontlines. For the struggle with paratroopers - terrorists of the enemy one should create the elimination units of local self-defense from among reliable people. The government must have at its disposal, wherever it is located, a strong military fist consisting of the reliable people loyal to the government. One should undertake all measures without delay to mine major ports and areas of possible landing of the enemy; here we will render the needed assistance.Fourth. As to the question posed in the letter of cde. KIM IL SUNG to cde. FENG XI [Stalin] on the assistance with armed forces [to North Korea], we consider as a most appropriate form of such assistance to be the assistance by volunteer units. On this question you have to take consultations, first of all, with Chinese comrades.You will receive in a few days the answer to the letter of cde. KIM IL SUNG.FENG XI [STALIN]2 copies - 1 - cde.

      "Transmitted to BulganinOn 1.X.50 [1 October 1950]To BEIJING, SOVIET AMBASSADORFor immediate transmission to MAO ZEDONG and ZHOU ENLAI.I am far away from Moscow on vacation and somewhat detached from events in Korea. However, judging by the information that I have received from Moscow today, I see that the situation of our Korean friends is getting desperate.It was on 16 September already that Moscow warned our Korean friends that the landing of the U.S. troops at Jemulpo [Incheon] had great significance and was aimed at cutting off the First and Second Army Groups of the North Koreans from their rear in the North. Moscow admonished them to withdraw at least four divisions from the South immediately, to set up a front line to the north and east of Seoul, and later to gradually pull out most of the troops fighting in the South northward, thereby providing for the defense of the 38th parallel. However, the 1 [First] and 2 [Second] Army Groups' Commands failed to implement Kim Il Sung's order for the withdrawal of troops northward, which allowed the U.S. troops to cut them off and surround them. Our Korean friends have no troops capable of resistance in the vicinity of Seoul. Hence, one needs to consider the way toward the 38th parallel wide open.I think that if in the current situation you consider it possible to send troops to assist the Koreans, then you should move at least five-six divisions toward the 38th parallel at once so as to give our Korean comrades an opportunity to organize combat reserves north of the 38th parallel under the cover of your troops. The Chinese divisions could be considered as volunteers, with Chinese in command at the head, of course.I have not informed and am not going to inform our Korean friends about this idea, but I have no doubt in my mind that they will be glad when they learn about it.I await your reply.Greetings,F I L I P P O V [STALIN]1 October 1950\n",

      "Top SecretCable Nº 4784PriorityPeking, to the Soviet Ambassador. Pass immediately to Cde. Mao Zedong.\"Your representatives arrived today, and we senior VPK(b) officials and your representatives had an opportunity to discuss the issues of which you are aware. The following became clear from the exchange of opinions:1. The Chinese forces designated for assistance are not ready, are poorly-armed, do not have enough artillery, have no tanks, aircraft cannot be provided for protection before two months, and a minimum of six months is needed to supply and train these troops.2. If direct aid is not given within a month with a considerable quantity of well-armed troops then in view of the precariousness of the Korean units north of the 38th parallel Korea will be occupied by the Americans.3. Accordingly, substantial aid with troops can be provided to the Koreans only after six months, that is after the occupation of Korea by the Americans, that is when it will no longer be needed.In view of the above and considering the unfavorable conditions in the internal situation of China which according to the reports of Cde. Zhou Enlai would follow China's entry into the war, we have unanimously come to the following conclusions:1. In spite of favorable international conditions, in view of their unpreparedness at the present time the Chinese troops should not cross the Korean border in order not to find themselves in an unfavorable position;2. If the troops have already crossed the border they ought not to move further than the mountainous regions along the Chinese border;3. Consider it advisable for Korean units to occupy the mountainous regions north of Pyongyang and Wonsan for defense and to transfer part of the troops to partisan status in the rear of the enemy;4. Withdraw the best of the mobilized Koreans with command personnel to Manchuria quietly and in small groups where Korean divisions are to be formed from them;5. Pyongyang and other important locations south of the mountainous region of North Korea are to be immediately evacuated.As regards the tanks, artillery, and aircraft required by the Chinese comrades to reequip the Chinese army the USSR will begin to supply them in full. We await your decision.\"Signed: FilippovZhou Enlai11 October 1950Report when this is done. One copy printed for Cde. Stalin.[...] \n",

Secretary of the C[entral] C[ommittee]* * * * *Attachment to#73 (op) of the Politburo Protocol #78Top SecretPyongyangTO MATVEYEV [RAZUVAYEV  V.N.]TO SHTYKOVThe serious predicament in the area of Seoul and in the South-East in which the Korean People's Army has found itself lately has to a great extent been caused by a series of grave mistakes made by the Frontline Command, the Commands of the Army Groups and army groupings in matters related to command and control over troops, as well as to the tactics of their combat use in particular.It is our military advisers who are even more to blame for these mistakes. Our military advisers failed to implement scrupulously and in a timely fashion the order of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief for the withdrawal of four divisions from the central front to the area of Seoul despite the fact that at the moment of adopting this decision such a possibility existed. Consequently, they lost seven days which brought about an enormous tactical advantage in the vicinity of Seoul to the U.S. troops. Had they pulled out these divisions on time, this could have changed the military situation around Seoul considerably. Odd battalions and separate detachments arriving in the vicinity of Seoul, unprepared for combat, could not produce any effect because of lack of coordination and communications with the staff. The division which arrived from the southeast was thrown into combat in a disorganized manner and in odd units, which made it easier for the enemy to decimate and annihilate it. As we directed earlier, you should have deployed this division for combat at the line northeast and east of Seoul, reorganize it there, give its soldiers at least one day of respite, prepare it for battle and only afterwards introduce these troops into combat.One cannot help taking serious note of erroneous and absolutely inadmissible tactics for tank use in combat. Lately you have used tanks in combat without preliminary artillery strikes aimed at clearing the field for tank maneuvers. As a consequence, the enemy easily destroys your tanks. Our military advisers who have personal experience from the Great Patriotic War must be aware that such ignorant use of tanks leads to their loss.One cannot help noticing the strategic illiteracy of our advisers and their incompetence in intelligence matters. They failed to grasp the strategic importance of the enemy's assault landing in Inch'on, denied the gravity of its implications, while Shtykov even suggested that we should bring to trial the author of an article in the \"Pravda\" about the U.S. assault landing. This blindness and lack of strategic experience led to the fact that they doubted the necessity of redeploying troops from the South toward Seoul, as well as procrastinated over their redeployment and slowed it down considerably, thereby losing a week to the enemy's enjoyment.The assistance provided by our military advisers to the Korean Command in such paramount matters as communications, command and control over troops, organization of intelligence and combat is exceptionally weak. As a result of this, the KPA troops, in essence, are beyond control: they are engaged in combat blindly and cannot arrange the coordination between the various armed services in battle. One can tolerate such a situation during a successful offensive, but one cannot allow this to happen when the frontline situation is worsening.You must elucidate all these points to our military advisers, and first of all to Vasilyev.In the present military situation, in order to provide assistance to the Korean Command, especially in the questions of an organized pullout of the KPA troops from the southeast and the prompt organization of a new defense front to the east, south, and north of Seoul, our military advisers must arrange the following:1. The pullout of the main forces must be conducted under the protection of strong rear guards dispatched from the divisions and capable of rendering serious resistance to the enemy. This can be achieved if the command over the rear guards is assigned to commanders with considerable military experience, if the rear guards are strengthened with standing and antitank artillery, field engineering units, and, if possible, with tanks.2. The rear guards must engage in combat from defensive line to defensive line, making broad use of engineering fortifications, including mines and materials at hand.The rear guards must act decisively and actively in order to gain the time required for the pullout of the main forces.3. The bulk of the troops of the divisions, to the extent possible, must be withdrawn in a compact manner, ready to force their way forward, but not in separate and odd units. The major force must dispatch strong forward guards armed with artillery and, if possible, with tanks.4. Tanks must be used only in joint action with infantry and only after preliminary artillery fire.5. One must dispatch forward detachments to occupy and hold ravines, bridges, ferries, passes and important road junctions located along the way of the movement of the major forces until the latter pass through them.6. Special attention must be paid to the questions of the organization of field intelligence, as well as flank protection and maintenance of communications between marching troops' columns.7. When preparing for defense, one should avoid stretching out the troops along the entire front line but tightly cover the main directions and set up strong reserve units for active actions.8. When setting up communications with troops via the line of the Korean Command, one must utilize radio with the use of codes.In the future, while organizing the work of our military advisers in accordance with this directive, you must undertake all necessary measures so that none of our military advisers will be captured by the enemy, as was directed earlier.Report on the implementation of this directive.

He noted that the impressions were very good, the firm leadership of the Party, the high level of organization, the discipline, and the labor enthusiasm of the population are felt in everything.He noted that, in the opinion of Cde. N. D. Mal’tsev, Deputy Minister of Power Engineering and Electrification, and other comrades who had come to the DPRK in the Soviet delegation, at the Pyongyang Thermal Power Plant whose installed capacity is 500,000 kwt and the loading is 400,000 kwt, one can get additional loading from a more regular repair of the boiler units and an improvement of other technical and economic indicators. If the Korean side wishes, a group of Soviet specialists can be assigned to the DPRK who could make appropriate recommendations. The realization of them would allow a considerable increase of the loading of the Thermal Power Plant’s units to be achieved by the end of the year.He expressed the appreciation of the Soviet government for the selfless efforts of the Korean medical personnel displayed in saving the life of specialist P. I. Bocharov, who received very severe burns as a result of an unfortunate accident during work at the Pyongyang Thermal Power Plant. He reported that three Korean medical personnel had been awarded the medal, “For Labor Valor“ by a Decree of the Presidium of the USSR Supreme Soviet.Kim Il Sung expressed gratitude for the high appreciation of the efforts of the Korean medical personnel, and said that he knows about this incident very well, and stressed that the doctors were given instructions to do everything possible to save Cde. Bocharov, and expressed satisfaction that the life of the patient was not out of danger.Then he touched on the situation at the Bukchang Thermal Power Plant, and said there are difficulties there inasmuch as work was done with insufficient energy in the summer of last year and right now it is necessary to catch up on the backlog [of work]. Everything possible needs to be done to put the first unit into operation in May. Only this can save us.Cde. S. A. Skachkov reported that during the visit to Bukchang one could have been convinced that energetic measures are being taken there to accelerate the construction work and install the equipment. He said that the most serious attention is being devoted to this facility in Moscow, and the shipment of yet-undelivered equipment is being strictly monitored.Expressing satisfaction at this, Kim Il Sung noted that with the coming of warm days the tempo of construction work will be accelerated even more, and the backlog will be overcome, particularly with the construction of the intake station. He requested that the necessary assistance be given to accelerate the construction and installation of equipment. He stressed that the greatest difficulty in the country is the shortage of electrical power, especially in the past two years. An unprecedented drought has had an effect. The Yunfeng Hydroelectric Station on a river bordering China with a capacity of 400,000 kwt has been completely shut down, and has not operated for five months; the Sup’ung [Shuifeng] Hydroelectric Station with a capacity of 700,000 kwt, repaired and expanded with the aid of the Soviet Union, is operating well, but has recently been operating with reduced loading because of a lack of water: only two units are operating, each with a capacity of 100,000 kwt, and have a total loading of 35,000 kwt. There is little water at the Chandingan [sic; proper Korean spelling unkown] Hydroelectric Station. If not for the Pyongyang Thermal Power Plant all the factories in the area of the city and its outskirts would have to shut down.Why do we stress the construction of the Bukchang Thermal Power Station so much? Because if there is a drought this year we will have to “throw up [our] hands”, and the economy will be completely paralyzed. If we manage to put a capacity of 200,000 kwt at the Bukchang Thermal Power Station into operation this year, then the situation will be substantially alleviated. We are asking for everything possible to be done to help us. Our only hope is Bukchang.As regards the Pyongyang Thermal Power Plant, you have expressed interesting ideas. We would welcome the arrival of Soviet specialists to study the possibilities of obtaining additional loading, and will discuss the question of the more regular repair of the boilers. This is a good idea.Cde. S. A. Skachkov noted that in Moscow they regard with understanding the situation which has been created with electric power, the efforts of the Korean side, and its wishes. He expressed the opinion that in the course of the conversations with the Korean comrades in Pyongyang and Moscow great prospects were charted out for the development of economic cooperation between our countries. We also favor such a development.In this connection it was noted from our side that a backlog was observed in January through March in the shipping of Korean goods intended for shipment to the USSR according to the trade turnover protocol, which puts our enterprises in a difficult position.Kim Il Sung replied that he knows about this, but as a consequence of the shortage of electrical power it didn’t seem possible to rectify the situation. Many plants were shut down or have not been operating at full capacity. Only the chemical fertilizer complex in Hamhung is operating at full capacity. The calcium carbide production plants have been shut down, which led to the cessation of the production of Vinylon. Electric furnace plants and, to put it briefly, all the energy-intensive enterprises are not operating. The situation is very difficult. We will evidently not fulfill the plan for the first half of the year, and this has had and is having a serious effect on foreign trade. If such a situation continues we will not be able to fulfill the annual plan in both industry and foreign trade. Talk about this in Moscow so that the appropriate organizations regard this with understanding.A large amount of electrical energy will be required beginning with the middle of April to ensure the supply of water to the fields. Usually we use 300,000 kwt of capacity for these purposes, but we will be forced to economize on this. But there is no choice – the needs of agriculture have to be provided, even if it will be necessary to shut down industrial enterprises.2. I informed Cde. Kim Il Sung about the latest session of the Political Consultative Council [PKK] of the Warsaw Pact Member Countries which opens today in Budapest. I noted that the complex international situation requires a further perfection of the military-political mechanism of the socialist countries.Kim Il Sung wished the PKK session success and said that this is a necessary and timely matter. He stressed, we also have a tense situation. The Americans are holding large maneuvers in the south of Korea, and have airlifted more than 2,000 soldiers and combat equipment from the US. The day before yesterday (15 March) there was an armed clash in the region of the demilitarized zone. The Americans initially behaved calmly, but then unexpectedly shelled our posts, firing 800 rounds. We responded. Six from that side were killed or wounded. The Americans wanted to take them out on a helicopter. But the helicopter was shot down and 10 more died, 16 in all. Today a meeting of the Military Armistice Commission is being convened at our suggestion. We will declare a firm protest in connection with the shelling.The same day, 15 March, an incident occurred on the Korean-Chinese border, but without the use of weapons. Approximately 50 Chinese crossed the Tumen River border and moved on a small Korean village located 200 meters from the shore. We don’t know with exactly what purpose, possibly they wanted to take residents away with them. There were only militiamen in the village. A detachment of Korean border guards headed to the village to detain the violators, but they fled, seizing several bulls and carts.After the incident on the Soviet-Chinese border on 2 March the Chinese increased the demonstrations on their shore and shouted, “Down with Kim Il Sung!” and “Down with the Korean revisionists!”. It’s like this every day. We have only an uneasy situation on the border with China, and the border is several hundred kilometers long.We told Kim Il Sung in detail about the armed provocation of the Chinese in the region of Damansky Island on 2 March, and the new provocations on 14 and 15 March.Listening to the information closely Kim Il Sung noted that the latest incident on the Chinese-Soviet border coincided with the incident on the Chinese-Korean border. It is necessary to closely investigate whether this coincidence is accidental or not. We have prepared a protest note in connection with the incident on the Korean-Chinese border.In reply to the question, how he assesses the actions of the Chinese, and what they want to achieve by seeking armed provocations and other insidious methods Kim Il Sung replied: right now Mao Zedong is no different from Chiang Kai-shek and the Chinese militarists.3. In accordance with instructions we informed the interlocutor of the obstacles created by the Chinese authorities to the transportation of weapons being sent for Vietnam from the USSR and other socialist countries. We stressed that the Vietnamese comrades are seriously afraid that the Chinese will completely prohibit the transportation of freight through Chinese territory and are isolating Vietnam from the Soviet Union.Kim Il Sung characterized the behavior of the Chinese authorities as “barbarism”. It is hard to understand what they want, he added.The Chinese are increasing the provocations in all sectors. Probably Mao thinks that China is a great power, and therefore it alone ought to rule the entire world. He wants to set his people against the Soviet Union. It’s the same with respect to the DPRK. The Chinese people do not agree with this. In my opinion, [we] need to display restraint and calm, and not give in to provocations. Preparations are underway in China for a Party congress. Evidently, Mao Zedong is striving to use his provocations before the congress to strengthen anti-Soviet sentiments among the people, and to thereby justify his line. I think that Mao will hardly go to war with the USSR.I don’t think that he will begin a war with us, either.The Chinese assert that we are revisionists, and want to exacerbate relations between our peoples. They consider us revisionists because we are developing and will develop relations with the Soviet Union and do not oppose the line of the Soviet comrades. Their main goal is to oppose the Soviet Union. Mao Zedong hopes that if the authority of the Soviet Union is damaged then his, Mao’s, chances are increased.4. We reported that a meeting of the Commission to Prepare for the International Conference on Communist and Worker’s Parties opens today in Moscow. We mentioned the invitation to take part in the Conference sent by the Soviet Ambassador at the instructions of the CPSU CC.Kim Il Sung replied that the question of the participation of KWP representatives was repeatedly touched on in conversations with Cde. D. S. Polyansky and the Soviet Ambassador. The KWP CC Politburo has discussed this question more than once. But it is hard for us to make a favorable decision.I have already said that our relations with China right now have become much worse, and the situation is tense. We don’t want to give the Chinese an excuse to think that we are attacking them first. Participation in the Conference might lead to an open split with China. Of course, we don’t want a worsening of our relations with the CPSU, with the Soviet Union, [or] with the Soviet people. We want to develop these relations. But it is very important for us how relations with China take shape. This does not mean we fear the Chinese, we don’t fear them, but we don’t want to give the Chinese a reason to accuse of taking part in an anti-Chinese campaign. Possibly, questions connected with China will not be especially touched on at the Conference. But the Chinese will all the same assert that the Conference had an anti-Chinese orientation.We have a small border with the USSR, but a long one with China. Every day the Chinese might try provocations. This is a serious question for us. In the south there is one enemy, the Americans, in the north, another – the Chinese. Anything is possible. We are forced to swallow the bitter pills which the Chinese throw us. In connection with the recent incident, in connection with the slogans against Kim Il Sung and the Korean leadership our young people suggest giving the Chinese a rebuff since it’s impossible to tolerate any more. But I personally think it’s necessary to exhibit restraint.Our situation is difficult, said Kim Il Sung. We ask [you] to understand and report all this to Cde. L. I. Brezhnev and the other Soviet leaders.Again I want to stress, we don’t want to give the Chinese an excuse to launch hostile anti-Korean propaganda still wider. If the Chinese attack us, then that is another matter.Let the representatives of the Communist and worker’s Parties meet in Moscow and discuss questions, this is a good thing.5. At the end of the conversation we touched on the question of his trip to the Soviet Union.Again thanking Cde. L. I. Brezhnev for the invitation, Kim Il Sung said: I am going. I have talked about this to Cde. D. S. Polyansky and the Ambassador, and have promised to go. Now I am confirming [it]. When? It needs to be discussed. I have already been in the Soviet Union more than once, it can be said, [as] a private guest. I will go this year without fail.We have invited Cde. N. V. Podgornyy to come to us. Will he come?We replied that Cde. N. V. Podgornyy plans to visit the DPRK in spring of this year.In conclusion Kim Il Sung again asked that greetings be sent to Cdes. L. I. Brezhnev, N. V. Podgornyy, and A. N. Kosygin.We expressed gratitude for the conversation, which lasted about two hours.Choe Won-sik, chief of a sector of the KWP CC International Department, and V. S. Nemchinov, Counsellor of the Embassy, were present at the conversation. SOVIET AMBASSADOR IN THE DPRK [signature]   (N. Sudarikov)6-gp1 – to Cde. K. F. Katushev2 – to Cde. V. N. Novikov3 – to Cde. A.

The “local governments” would be controlled by the latter.The “Standing Committee” would decide on important questions in the political life of the country, foreign affairs policies, national defense, and all other significant issues of internal affairs.Internally, the “Standing Committee” would control and facilitate the collaboration of the North and the South, would help to grow the parts of the country closer. Externally, it is intended to represent one state: the “Democratic Confederate Republic of Goryeo (DCRG)”.The DCRG – according to the proposal – cannot take part in any military alliance, consequently it has to pursue a policy of neutrality. A policy of neutrality – said the charge d’affaires – as it would represent different political systems in the North and the South, and as such, it would not be able to participate in any military blocs either.It would embody the whole Korea in its foreign policy, therefore one delegation would represent the country in its diplomatic activities in the UN, and in other international organizations and events. According to their idea, the DCRG would be a pacifist country that would build good relations with all other countries around the world. Foreign bases and troops would not be allowed on its territory, through which it would become a region of peace without any nuclear weaponry.The charge d’affairs requested that one of the leaders of our party and government should officially support the aforementioned proposal via our press. He justified his request due to the novelty of their suggestion.[Handwritten note: It is difficult to support such bullshit! And the suggestion is not new!]Expressing my thanks for his information I emphasized that we were following the work of the party congress through the report of our delegation, and from the materials of our communication services. The Korean report and activity of our delegation have been approved by our party’s Political Bureau.Our delegation was able to personally ascertain the wonderful economic successes of the Korean people, and the monolithic unity of their nation in following Comrade Kim Il Sung.I pointed out about their reunification suggestion that according to our assessment, there is nothing new or different in their proposal, they have merely supplemented their previous suggestions and made them more concrete. They went to the limit of their possibilities with their suggestion. The current obstacles in moving forward are the American troops stationed in the South, and the terror suppressing democratization.Regarding ideological support, we find the socialist building in the North very promising, whereas concerning the South, the priority is the withdrawal of the foreign troops stationed there.I promised to forward his information to our leaders, and to notify our Main Press Department about the aforementioned reunification ideas.When discussing the importance of our highest possible ranked greeting that we conveyed to their party’s congress, and which they published in the Korean press, I complained to the charge d’affaires about the unusual and incomprehensible behavior of their deputy military attache and their first secretary towards the leader of the Hungarian Defense Alliance of Eger. I stressed that he was conveying the greetings of Comrade Kádár János toward Comrade Kim Il Sung, expressing the greetings of our party and the entire Hungarian society. Various individual letters reduce the value of this letter, therefore we think that they are unnecessary. I pointed out that the Korean side would also find a similar conduct of our Pyongyang embassy unacceptable as well. I strongly asked the Korean diplomat to talk to their embassy and make sure that similar incidents would not happen in the future from their part.The Korean charge d’affaires did not respond anything meaningful, he tried to make the impression that he is hearing of the incident for the first time.

      "On 29 July 1955, at 4:30 p.m., I returned the visit of Soviet Ambassador Vasily Ivanovich Ivanov, with whom I had made an appointment. I took Comrade Golub with me as a translator. During the conversation we discussed the following main subjects:…] Comrade Ivanov mentioned that on 30th July, the inaugural ceremony to mark the opening of the Soviet Red Cross Hospital would take place in the eastern part of Pyongyang, and he invited me to it. I expressed my thanks for his thoughtfulness, and told him I had already received an invitation. Comrade Ambassador said that the hospital in question had been built with Soviet assistance, and its facilities had also been sent to the Korean comrades in the framework of Soviet aid. The hospital has 400 beds and a clinic, the latter also being suitable for the treatment of patients. I told him we had expected the new Hungarian medical team to arrive today, but the plane had not arrived because of the bad weather. Comrade Soviet Ambassador asked for information about the Hungarian hospital. I told him that our hospital was in Sariwon. I invited Comrade Ivanov to take a later trip to Sariwon to inspect the Hungarian hospital. He was glad to accept the invitation.We then had a conversation about the changes that had taken place in the international situation. I told him that the recent four-power conference in Geneva had been of great importance. If the Soviet Union's proposal for disarmament were accepted, it would lead to an improvement in the workers' material and cultural conditions in every country. Hungary also spends a substantial part of its budget expenditures for defense purposes. Comrade Ivanov confirmed what I had said.In connection with this, he asked me about my opinion of the economic situation in South Korea, with special regard to the material conditions of the South Korean population. I told him that according to the information available to us, the conditions of the population of South Korea were bad. This is based on the fact that in South Korea, the number of unemployed exceeds two million. A number of people are starving. Various kinds of taxes are imposed on the population, particularly on the peasants who have to deliver a large part of their produce to meet their delivery obligation. The state purchases their crops at a cheap rate. Comrade Ivanov immediately asked me from where we had got these pieces of information. I told him that [we had received them] partly from local [North Korean] sources of information and the South Korean press reports, and partly from the neutral commission overseeing the armistice. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to get information from the latter. Comrade Ivanov then said that South Korea received large quantities of artificial fertilizer and many consumer goods from the USA, which improved the conditions of the population to a certain extent. In addition, they harvest twice a year, and this also improves the economic situation. Of course, the material conditions are not improving for the entire population, but the situation of certain strata, particularly of the urban population, is bearable. In reply to this I told him that the USA sends a lot of raw materials and agricultural products from South Korea to Japan so as to support Japan, a country deficient in raw materials. The USA purchases these goods from South Korea at very cheap prices.Comrade Ivanov asked me whether I was of the opinion that the Korean comrades did not devote great care to the improvement of the population's material conditions. I said that in the last half year, the situation had somewhat improved in this respect, but not sufficiently. Comrade Ambassador then told me that the Korean comrades had made serious mistakes. He asked me how it had been possible that the diplomatic corps did not discuss these issues with the Korean comrades. Had they kept an eye on these issues, the Korean comrades would not have made a series of mistakes [emphasis in the original], e.g. the abolition of free market, the grain procurement, and so on. He visited the city's shops and markets in recent days, and saw that as a result of the correct resolution recently passed, which allowed private capital to take some initiative, conditions in commerce and the supply of goods improved, and, consequently, the price of certain products decreased. In reply to this I told him that the members of the diplomatic corps had discussed these issues with each other, but they failed to raise the subject collectively in the presence of the competent Korean authorities, because the Korean comrades were very sensitive due to the mistakes they had made, and they would not have interpreted the comments in the most appropriate way. Comrade Ivanov said that the DPRK should have devoted very great care to the improvement of the population's material conditions. The [North and South Korean] populations are equally familiar with the South and North Korean economic situation, since the borders are not hermetically sealed. North Korea should have an attraction to South Koreans in order to demonstrate the superiority of the people's democratic system over the capitalist one. Otherwise, the Korean comrades devote all their energies to the development of heavy industry, although the Soviet Union could provide assistance to Korea by supplying consumer goods as well.In my reply I also confirmed Comrade Ivanov's opinion. I told him that the Korean comrades had asked for equipment for heavy industry and factories from us too, although we also could have given them equipment for light industry and other products which would have enabled them to improve the population's material conditions in the near future. I mentioned that the Korean comrades had asked us for, among other things, a scale-making factory. Jokingly, I said that they should have had something to be weighed first, and scales only after that. On the other hand, we have already seen examples of this question. I reminded Comrade Ivanov of the events that had taken place in the years past in the German Democratic Republic, where the population's unsatisfactory material conditions also played a role in the outbreak of various provocations.Comrade Ivanov confirmed what I had said, then apologized for raising such serious issues on the occasion of my visit, but, he went on to say that he had to do so because he had not yet gotten to know adequately the situation here. On the other hand, I was the only person he intended to tell about the questions raised and about his opinion. He will not discuss these with the other Comrade Ambassadors in such a way; he emphasized he intended to discuss them with the doyen of the diplomatic corps. In his opinion, the mistakes made by the Korean comrades should be raised in the presence of the top leaders, and in certain issues, the opinion of the whole diplomatic corps should be made known so as to ensure that the [Korean] comrades do not consider these comments as lecturing and ordering but notice the sincere helpfulness that inspired them. Our attitude will facilitate their [the Soviets'] situation if they take sides or give advice to the Korean comrades. The conversation, which lasted for some 75 minutes, took place in a sincere, friendly atmosphere.Comment:1.) As I have already reported by telegram, the raising of the questions was surprising and unusual. Hitherto, we have not experienced similarly sharp statements on the part of the Soviet comrades, at least not in this way. I am convinced that they have already criticized these issues very intensely, but they have not expressed their views in the presence of the diplomats of the fraternal countries. Still, this also had its antecedents, because Counsellor Petrov had already criticized issues of domestic politics quite sharply, and, in fact, that time we were of the opinion that his criticism was a bit too sharp.On the basis of all this, one can conclude that the Soviet comrades consider the situation rather difficult, they anticipate the events [i.e. the problems that may result from the policies of the North Korean leadership], and they are doing their best to persuade the Korean comrades of the mistakes they have made, and it seems that they want to make use of the assistance of the diplomatic corps to achieve this purpose, in expectation that the Korean comrades may recognize their errors more easily if they are reminded of the latter by several [embassies]. I would like to make an additional remark about the whole question, namely, that the issue is quite delicate. One can touch it only very cautiously. One must think twice before raising questions like this so as to find the appropriate way. I must remind the comrades that I discussed these issues with Nam Il. Speaking with him, I raised economic issues as if I had asked for information, having not been to Korea for a long time. He stated that the situation was rather good, and although there had been some difficulties, “no one has starved to death yet in Korea,” which, unfortunately, was not true. It was true, though, that when he made the statement mentioned above, the worst was already over and some improvement had set in. He did not speak about the errors committed, just about how they wanted to establish a grain basis in 2 to 3 years. In my view, the last plenum of the [Korean] Workers' Party dealt with these issues quite sharply. It specified the mistakes, and it also took steps along the state line in order to correct these excessive measures. There are difficulties in carrying out [the new instructions]. The composition of the state apparatus, the executive organs and the provincial party and state organs is extremely weak, they cannot cope with the tasks. The executive organs are quite bureaucratic and inflexible. Lately, a rather intense struggle goes on in order to change that, in the press and other fields. Hitherto, this has not yielded yet any visible results. Comrade Kim Il Sung spoke to me too about the cadres' lack of professional and political skills when he mentioned that “they are young and inexperienced”. For our part, we have already stated several times that the Korean comrades wanted to solve the agricultural problem too quickly. Otherwise, this is confirmed by the experiences of the past winter when there were rather serious difficulties, and the latter were undoubtedly related to the quick pace of the reorganization of agriculture (it was too quick, 25 percent of the peasant farms joined cooperatives in a year). It is only now that they begin to intensely organize Machine-Tractor Stations. The cooperatives hitherto organized are still just slightly more productive than individual peasant farms. They do not exactly give more to the state [than the individual peasant farms]. Their work is easier. For the time being, the state cannot give them anything but a minor support. Therefore, it would be appropriate to strengthen the existent cooperatives for a time, and expand their network only later. In my judgment, this issue is one of the most pressing problems of agriculture. It coincides with the difficulties of [food] supply and deliveries, and, last but not least, the living standards of the population.2.) The issues raised by Comrade Ivanov are clear and comprehensible. It was unusual that he asked us to make occasional attempts at convincing the Korean comrades of the mistakes in certain issues, and, if possible, to prevent them [the mistakes]. Of course, this is a very difficult and delicate problem.It must be emphasized again that the Korean comrades deal with their own issues in an extremely reserved way. There are few opportunities for a completely sincere discussion of domestic issues. In my view, Comrade Ivanov also sees it, and this is why he thinks that it may be possible to discuss the individual questions appropriately if we approach them collectively and from several different directions.On the basis of all this one can conclude that the internal problems are somewhat greater than what we have hitherto seen or thought. I am clear about the fact that the Soviet comrades consider the issue serious and they actively deal with it.I also draw another conclusion from the conversation, namely, that the reason for Comrade Suzdalev's dismissal was probably that his activity in this field was considered insufficient. It must be noted, though, that he was sick a number of times and he spent a long time out of Korea. This also contributed to the situation.3.) I want to state that for the time being, I do not intend to take any initiative toward the diplomatic corps or the Korean comrades along the line described above. In my judgment, it is the Soviet comrades who have the say in this matter. I intend to take sides only if this is explicitly requested by the Korean comrades. I think this is sensible.Pál SzarvasAmbassador\n",

      "To Comrade Ambassador Vasile Sandru,During a discussion with comrade counselor C. Georgescu, the Counselor of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea Embassy said the following.The recent initiatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's leadership to restart the dialogue with South Korea to solve the reunification problem in a peaceful and democrat manner follow the rationale below: - The peaceful and democratic reunification is a desire of the population of North Korea and South Korea. Considering the changes in the leadership of South Korea, the initiatives are designed to urge and encourage the fight of the democratic forces and the masses, for a democratic renewal, for a new policy to deal with the national problem.- The state of tension in international affairs, especially in Asia, is encouraging the Korean reactionary forces and the American imperialists to make the new leadership of South Korea follow the policy of former president Park. This will increase the tension in this area as well.It is in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's interest that the geographic area of the Far East is now drawn into the politics and the global confrontation of the great powers.Considering the state of the country, the fragility of the situation in the area, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea remained neutral towards the situation in Afghanistan, reaffirming the principles which the policy of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is based on. It emphasized on the decision to act in order to protect the independence and sovereignty [of countries], to solve the national problem in a peaceful and democratic manner, without foreign interference. The recent initiative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea follows the same path.The Korean diplomat highlighted that the feedback and support for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's initiative found in Romania are greatly appreciated in Pyongyang.

      "As I already reported by telegram, from February 4 to 12 a GOSPLAN [Soviet National Planning Office] deputation led by a head of department had negotiations in Pyongyang. Their discussions covered primarily the nuclear power plant to be built with Soviet cooperation. Premier Kang Seong-san [Kang Song San] emphasized to the deputation that the project to be built was not only of economic but also of political importance. On the one hand, they would like to offset the fact that a nuclear power plant is already in operation in South Korea; on the other hand, [the project] is to enhance the DPRK’s economic prestige in foreign eyes. Their conceptions will be made final during the talks that he [Kang] is due to have in Moscow this spring.On the basis of a previous unspecified agreement, they practically reached a preliminary agreement on the terms of planning, construction, operation, and payment as well as on legal conditions. With regard to the terms of payment, the interest rate on the credit of 2 billion dollars that the Soviet side is supposed to give has not yet been specified. The Korean side tries to insist on the previous rate of 2 percent, whereas the Soviet side proposes an agreement on 4 to 6 per cent. The Korean minister of foreign trade had talks about this issue in Moscow, and [the two sides] are expected to reach a final agreement during the visit of the [North Korean] premier. The Korean side will contribute to the investment costs with the same amount of money. The selection of the construction site, in accordance with the relevant international standards, is in progress, and, according to the Soviet side, it may last as long as two years. The Koreans selected six sites, which are now being geologically and seismographically located by land and air. The industrial area of Hamheung, situated on the coast of the Sea of Japan and equipped with proper infrastructure, seems to be the most probable site. The prospective length of construction time constitutes a problem. The Korean side would like to complete the construction [of the nuclear power plant] in five years, whereas the Soviet experts estimate that it will take 10 to 12 years.Plans are prepared by the Soviet side; this is facilitated by the fact that a [nuclear] power plant of a similar capacity was already built in Cuba. The reactor, the blocks, the safety zone, and the supply units will be built by Soviet experts. For 5 years after their completion, all these facilities will be operated under the guidance of Soviet experts. The other related units, the external and biological safety zone, and the supply units will be built by the Korean side.An agreement was reached that equipment of COMECON origin would be procured, with Soviet cooperation, by the Korean side, while convertible equipment would be ordered and paid for by the Soviet side, to the account of the Koreans. The Korean side accepted that the construction and future operation of the power plant would be in accordance with the standards of the International Atomic Energy Agency, and, of course, that organization would be able to enforce its right to conduct inspections.The leaders of the Korean work brigades will have to undergo further vocational training in the Soviet Union before the start of construction.[North Korean] geological surveys for uranium ore will be speeded up with Soviet cooperation; the initial results are encouraging, but for a certain time the Soviet Union will provide the power plant with enriched uranium. At his request, Comrade [Ferenc] Rátkai was informed about the aforementioned issues by the 1st secretary of the Soviet embassy, who is dealing with questions of economic policy.

      "02/01162/19.02.1973To Comrade VASILE GLIGA, Secretary to the MinisterRecently we had a talk with Kim Chan-seok [Kim Chan Suk], Deputy Director General of the Pyongyang Industrial Bank, the leader of the DPRK delegation that is participating in an international reunion taking place in Istanbul. Throughout the discussion the issue of Korean reunification was tackled, in the light of the Joint Communiqué of the North and South in July 1972, as well as of the agreement to establish the SNCC [South-North Coordinating Committee] since the autumn of last year.I am taking note of the following facts conveyed by our interlocutor:Despite the SNCC having decided upon a series of specific measures in the framework of North-South collaboration in the economic, political, cultural and defense fields that are meant to bring about unification, the authorities in Seoul have made declarations against any type of collaboration, going as far as affirming that the issue of reunification should be brought up again 10 years from now.A series of specific facts prove that the South Korean authorities do not wish to take serious measures towards reunification. Recently, the DPRK has suggested a delivery of raw materials to certain factories in the South in order to prevent expensive imports from India. Though the offer was extremely favorable for the South, it was rejected.According to the opinion of the DPRK, the independent and peaceful reunification of the country will not be possible until U.S. troops leave the South—a fact which would create the necessary conditions for organizing free elections on democratic foundations. In the course of the legitimate struggle of the Korean people for reunification, the revolutionary strengthening of the North has particular significance.As far as the U.N. is concerned, it could make a significant contribution if it decides on withdrawing the so-called “U.N. forces,” which have been occupying the South for more than 20 years, as well as on dissolving the UNCURK [UN Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea].Kim Chan-seok described the position of Turkey as hostile, though Turkish diplomats have noted that the aggression in 1950 was decided upon by [Prime Minister Adnan] Menderes without parliamentary approval.Kim Chan-seok showed significant interest for the political situation in Turkey and showed interest for both official and informal contacts with representatives of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs as well as with those of other ministries.At their request of assisting them with this issue, we replied we have no possibility since the central administration is found in Ankara.Also, we have been asked to distribute PR materials for the DPRK. We expressed our regret in not being able to, due to a Turkish law which forbids the dissemination of such materials, unless they describe our own country.\tSigned: Ilie Tudor\n",

      "[...]1. [...]2. [...] Kim thinks they should not count on substantial help from the partisans, but Pak Heon-yeong has a different opinion. He thinks the help [from partisans] will be significant. At any rate, they hope that the partisans will help in actions against the communications of the enemy and that they will occupy the main ports of South Korea, though they will not be able to do this at the beginning of the campaign, maybe later.3. With regard to the question of how the population will regard the fact that the northerners will begin a civil war, Kim Il Sung oscillates. During the conversation on September 12 he definitely stated that if the northerners begin military actions, this will produce a negative impression in the people and that it is politically disadvantageous to them to begin it. In connection with this he recollected that during the conversation between Mao Zedong and the Korean representative Kim Il in the spring of this year Mao stated that in his opinion the northerners should not begin military action now, since in the first place, it is politically disadvantageous and in the second place, the Chinese friends are occupied at home and cannot give them serious help. The thinking of Kim Il Sung amounts to waiting until the conclusion of the main [military] operations in China.In the conversation on September 13 Kim Il Sung, under the clear influence of Heo Gai [Ho Kai] (a Soviet Korean, secretary of the Central Committee of the Labor Party, who participated in the second conversation in order to translate), declared that the people will welcome an armed attack by the northerners and that if they begin military actions they will not lose politically because of this. Later in the course of the conversation Kim Il Sung stated that if a civil war is drawn out, then they will be in a politically disadvantageous position. And since under present conditions it is impossible to count on a rapid victory, he does not propose to begin a civil war, but only to secure the Ongjin peninsula and a portion of the territory of South Korea to the east of this peninsula, for example to Kaidzio [Gaeseong].They consider that in case of a civil war the population of South Korea will be sympathetic toward the northern army and will help it. In the case of successful military actions they hope to organize a number of uprisings in South Korea.4. According to official data, there are 500 American military advisers and instructors in South Korea. According to secret service information, which needs confirmation, there are 900 American military advisers and instructors and 1500 soldiers and security officers in South Korea. In case of a civil war in Korea, the Americans, in the opinion of Kim Il Sung and Pak Heon-yeong, can: send Japanese and Chinese [soldiers] to the aid of the southerners; support [the South Koreans] from the sea and air with their own means; American instructors will take immediate part in organizing military actions.5. The North Korean army numbers 97,500 men (including the air force and coastal defense units). The army has 64 tanks, 59 armored cars, 75 airplanes. The police force in the north numbers 23,200 men. Kim considers that the northern army is superior to the southern army in its technical equipment (tanks, artillery, planes), its discipline, the training of the officers and troops, and also in its moral-political relations.In the northern army there are a number of insufficiencies: insufficient number and weak preparation of pilots, insufficient number of ships, large caliber arms are unprepared for military operations, insufficient military supplies.The proposal of Kim Il Sung amounts to the following: at the beginning to strike the South Korean army on the Ongjin peninsula, to destroy the two regiments located there, to occupy the territory of the peninsula and the territory to the east of it, for example to Kaidzio [Gaeseong], and then to see what to do further. After this blow the South Korean army may become demoralized. In this case move further to the south. If the South Korean army is not demoralized as a result of the Ongjin operation, to seal the borders seized, to shorten in that way the line of defense approximately by one third.It is not possible to hurry with the operation on the Ongjin peninsula. [It is necessary] to wait until additional arms arrive from the Soviet Union. Meanwhile [we must] consolidate the defenses on the remaining portions of the 38th parallel.Kim Il Sung admits the possibility of the Ongjin operation turning into a civil war, but he hopes that this does not happen, since the southerners, in his opinion, do not dare to attack other portions of the 38th parallel.Our formulations.The partial operation outlined by Kim Il Sung can and will probably turn into a civil war between north and south. There are more than a few supporters of civil war in the leading circles of both the north and the south. Therefore, in beginning this partial operation it is necessary to calculate that it might be the beginning of a civil war. Is it advisable to the north to begin a civil war now? We propose that this is not advisable.The northern army is insufficiently strong to carry out successful and rapid operations against the south. Even taking into account the help which will be rendered to the northern army by the partisans and the population of South Korea it is impossible to count on a rapid victory. Moreover, a drawn out civil war is disadvantageous for the north both militarily and politically. In the first place, a drawn out war gives the possibility to the Americans to render corresponding aid to Syngmann Rhee. After their lack of success in China, the Americans probably will intervene in Korean affairs more decisively than they did in China and, it goes without saying, apply all their strength to save Syngmann Rhee. Further, in case of a drawn out civil war the military casualties, suffering and adversity may elicit in the population a negative mood toward the one who began the war.Moreover, a drawn out war in Korea could be used by the Americans for purposes of agitation against the Soviet Union and for further inflaming war hysteria. Therefore, it is inadvisable that the north begin a civil war now. Given the present internal and external situation a decision about an attack on the south would be correct only in such case as the northerners could count on ending the war quickly; the preconditions for it are not there.But if the indicated partial operation were crowned with success and did not lead to civil war, then in this case the northerners, while having won strategically, would lose politically in many regards. Such an operation would be used to accuse the northerners of trying to inflame a fratricidal war. It would also be used for the purpose of further increasing American and international interference in Korean affairs in the interests of the south.We propose that under the indicated conditions to begin the partial operation conceived by Kim Il Sung is inadvisable. \n",

      "TOP SECRETOn The Western Powers' Policy Regarding the German Question1 . The positions of the governments of the USA, England, France and Bonn on the German question at the time the three Western powers sent diplomatic notes to the Soviet Union on 23 September 1952The USA government position. The USSR Government proposal on the question of a peaceful settlement of the German problem, set forth in the Soviet diplomatic note of 10 March 1952, created serious difficulties for the realization of the main goal of U.S. policy toward Germany--the swiftest transformation of West Germany into a strike force for the aggressive bloc.The American newspaper The New York Times on 16 April 1952 evaluated, from the perspective of the U.S. government's plans, the significance of the Soviet proposals in the following manner:\"Adoption of the Kremlin's proposals would mean sacrificing the West German divisions that must become the foundation for the creation of the North Atlantic Alliance, put forward by General Eisenhower.\"In view of this, the USA government has, since the very beginning, embarked on a path of preventing quadripartite negotiations on the German question and, according to available information, only agreed under the influence of England and France to begin an exchange of diplomatic notes with the USSR regarding the conditions for convening a quadripartite conference. In discussing the response to each of the Soviet notes (of 10 March, 9 April, 24 May and 23 August 1952), the U.S. government tried to obtain agreement from its English and French partners to set forth preconditions for calling a quadripartite conference that would be clearly unacceptable to the Soviet Union and, consequently, would make the organization of negotiations impossible. In particular, the Americans insisted that it be proposed that the Soviet Union agree on the following:- assigning the illegally established U.N. commission or another “impartial” commission to carry out a review of the existence of conditions for free all-German elections in both sections of Germany; - providing the future all-German government, even prior to the conclusion of a peace treaty, unlimited freedom of participation in military alliances and coalitions;- recognizing the Potsdam resolutions with regard to the eastern border of Germany only as preliminary and subject to reexamination under the final peace settlement;- resuming negotiations on the Austrian treaty until the start of negotiations on the German question.At the same time, the USA government exerted strong pressure on the English, French and Bonn governments, trying to achieve the swiftest conclusion of negotiations on the Bonn separate agreement and the Paris agreement concerning the “European Defense Community,” in order to expedite creation of the aggressive West German armed forces. Following the signing of the Bonn and Paris agreements on 26 and 27 May, the USA government continued to put pressure on its partners in the aggressive bloc, insisting on the rapid ratification of these agreements.The position of the Bonn government. The Bonn government, headed by [Konrad] Adenauer, completely supported the line of the USA government on the German question.The Bonn government is the most irreconcilable enemy of all negotiations between the Western powers and the Soviet Union on the German question.The French High Commissioner for West Germany, François-Poncet, in his report to the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, dated 1 July 1952, emphasized that:The current tense situation satisfies Adenauer, while the relaxation of this situation, on the contrary, would hinder his plans.Adenauer, who, at American insistence, was brought in by the governments of the USA, England and France to discuss drafts of the diplomatic replies of the Western powers, insisted on including articles in these drafts intended to break down the talks. Thus, for example, in the answer to the Soviet note of 9 April, Adenauer insisted on the inclusion of demands for not recognizing the Oder-Neisse border. Within the narrow circle of the Christian-Democratic Union leadership, he announced in April 1952 that:[Anthony] Eden and [Robert] Schuman tried to introduce a tone of reconciliation into the text of the reply note of the Western powers. . . .The U.S. representative and I were able to maintain our perspective.At the same time, Adenauer forced negotiations on the Bonn and Paris agreements, and, after these were signed, began to strive for their swiftest ratification by the West German Bundestag. Already in July 1952, he pushed through the Bundestag draft legislation for the ratification of both agreements in their original text.Adenauer's political line met with full support from the Bonn government coalition parties (Christian-Democratic Union, Free Democratic Party, and the German Party). It is true that openly nationalistic, revanchist circles within the Free Democratic Party, as well as various military alliances and neo-fascist groups criticized Adenauer's policy and demanded that, in the negotiations with the Western powers, he strive more decisively for concessions to West Germany, in particular the liberation of German war criminals, the return of the Saar region to West Germany, and the provision of large American loans. Moreover, not one of these parties and groups came out in support of the Soviet proposals.However, certain other political parties and groups, though for different reasons, came out against Adenauer's policy, which was directed toward avoiding quadripartite negotiations and the swiftest enactment of the Bonn and Paris treaties. The so-called “neutral” circles of the West German bourgeoisie and intelligentsia, having united at the time around the “Extraordinary Commonwealth for Peace in Europe,” spoke out for serious examination of the Soviet proposals and against the ratification of the Bonn and Paris agreements. Two small political parties--the Center Party and the Bavarian Party--also believed it necessary to first determine the possibility of reestablishing German unity, and then resolve the question of West German participation in military alliances with the Western powers.The camp consisting of opponents of military-political agreements with the Western powers and supporters of adopting, or at least seriously studying, the Soviet proposals for peaceful settlement of the German problem were politically heterogeneous and divided. This was to a significant extent aided by the traitorous line of the West German Social Democratic Party leadership, which, purely for tactical reasons, came out in favor of “serious” examination of the Soviet proposals and against the Bonn and Paris treaties. According to unofficial reports, the leadership of the Social Democratic party actually opposed the Soviet proposals and supported examining them only because it had no doubt that they would be rejected by the Western powers. Thus, for example, a member of the Social Democratic party leadership, Hensler, speaking during a meeting of the Social Democratic faction in the Bundestag on 1 April 1952, declared that:We can support with complete calm any more decisive proposal[s] pertaining to quadripartite negotiations, since negotiations with the Western powers have gone so far that the bargain [sdelka] struck by Adenauer would not be ruined by it.The position of the English government. During the period of diplomatic correspondence between the Western powers and the USSR regarding the German question, the English government maintained a somewhat different position than the American and Bonn governments. The English spoke out against the unconditional rejection of the Soviet proposals and against the inclusion of certain clearly provocative “preconditions” in the replies of the Western powers. As the American newspaper The New York Times emphasized on 13 April 1952,\"within senior American diplomatic circles it is believed that . . . London and Paris, are probably not inclined to reject outright the Russian [diplomatic] note, as was evidently shown from the start by diplomats in Washington.\" According to unofficial reports, it was precisely the English government, with support from the French government, that opposed the American proposal regarding the resumption of negotiations on the Austrian agreement as a precondition for organizing negotiations on the German question. The Americans were forced to remove this proposal.In actuality, the English government was not interested in holding quadripartite negotiations on the German question. Even on 22 April 1952, Eden stated in his speech:We shall not permit [others] to distract us from constructive activity on the unification of Europe, which we have been occupied with in recent years. We shall not permit [others] to engage us in useless negotiations such as those that were held earlier on Germany or, for that matter, on the Austrian agreement, which is an example of still more pointless negotiations.On 1 August 1952, the Churchill administration pushed through the English parliament the ratification of the Bonn agreement. For tactical reasons, the Labor party voted against ratification and demagogically spoke out for “studying” the Soviet proposals.The position of the French government. The French government of Piné-Schuman, like the English government, did not strive to convene quadripartite negotiations on the German question or, moreover, toward a peaceful settlement of the German problem on the basis of an agreement with the USSR. The basis of Schuman's foreign policy was the principle of maintaining the division of Germany and including West Germany in the “European Defense Community.” However, the French government was forced to take into account that not only the working masses of France, but also influential circles in the French bourgeoisie, fearing a rebirth of German revanchism, do not support this policy. At the time, prominent figures in all the French bourgeois parties supported convening quadripartite negotiations on the German question. Thus, for example, one of the leaders of the party of “Independent Republicans,” Jacques Bardou, who was at the time the chairman of the Commission on Foreign Affairs within the National Assembly, publicly stated on 26 August:With respect to the proposal for convening the conference of four, I have always maintained that an attempt at negotiations by the four, with the aim of insuring free elections, establishing German unity, signing a peace treaty, and limiting European and German armament, is necessary for eliminating the threat of war.Similar statements were also made by a number of prominent activists of the Radical Party, the MRP, and the “Peasant” Party.The head of the Department of the Press and Information of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, De Less, declared during a press conference to a narrow circle of journalists that:\"... in France, there are people who wish to reject the idea of the establishment of a European army and the inclusion of West Germany in the North Atlantic Alliance.\"The English newspaper The Scotsman pointed out in March 1952 that there are “broad sections of society” in France for whom “the traditional French-Russian alliance with the aim of holding down Germany is a more reasonable foundation for French policy.” The newspaper emphasized further thatthese people are prepared to hold negotiations which could relax international tensions and free France from its burdensome contribution to the rearmament of the West and from its demeaning dependence on the United States.It should be noted, however, that these circles of the French bourgeoisie, including the so-called “neutralists,” who are speaking out in favor of organizing quadripartite negotiations, considered the Soviet proposal to allow a united Germany to possess national armed forces to be unacceptable. Thus, the newspaper Le Monde, which reflects the position of French “neutralist” circles, wrote on 20 March 1952:France believes that the rearmament of a united Germany is, at the present time, a step that carries with it more danger than advantages.Influential circles in the French bourgeoisie, who in one form or another supported negotiations with the USSR on the German question, came out even more decisively against the ratification of the Paris and Bonn agreements. By summer 1952, after the conventions of the main bourgeois parties in France, it became obvious that the distribution of forces in the National Assembly had become clearly unfavorable for the ratification of these agreements.In this situation, the Piné-Schuman administration was forced to maneuver. It could not support the American line for unconditional rejection of the Soviet proposals on the German question, while at the same time it could not fail to take into account that to convene quadripartite negotiations on the basis of the broad agenda proposed by the Soviet Union would lead to a significant delay or even the downfall of plans for the establishment of a “European army.”In connection with this, the French government set forth a proposal to the Americans on the expediency of holding negotiations with the USSR on the basis of a “limited” agenda, which would include only one question--the composition, functions and manner of activity of an “impartial” commission for investigating the existence of conditions in both parts of Germany for carrying out free all-German elections. According to available reports, the French government was calculating that a conference with such an agenda would meet with failure, for which they could then attempt to shift the responsibility to the Soviet Union.Thus, at the conference of representatives of the three Western powers to prepare a draft reply to the Soviet Union in June 1952, the French ambassador in Washington, [Henri] Bonnet, openly admitted that the French proposal for convening a quadripartite conference with a “limited” agenda is a forward-looking, calculated maneuver designed to guarantee the ratification of the Paris and Bonn agreements by the French parliament. The French bourgeois newspaper Le Figaro wrote on 13 June 1952 that:\"The Conference of Four . . . could ease parliamentary ratification of both agreements to the degree that it would demonstrate to the public that everything had been done to keep the door open for an agreement with Moscow.\"This thought was expressed by a number of other French bourgeois newspapers.The French proposal for holding quadripartite negotiations with a “limited” agenda was supported by the English government, as a result of which the government of the USA was forced to accept it, backing down from its own demand that the USSR agree to establish an “impartial” investigation commission as a precondition for organizing quadripartite negotiations.The position of the three Western powers on the question of negotiations with the USSR with regard to the German problem, laid out in the diplomatic note of 23 September 1952, consisted of the following:1. A conference of representatives of the four powers must be convened in order to discuss the question of the composition, functions and authorities of the “impartial” investigation commission, with the aim of creating the conditions necessary for carrying out free elections.2. Following the completion of the work of the commission, the representatives of the four powers must discuss its report and map out measures necessary for carrying out free all-German elections and establishing an all-German government.3. Following the completion of all-German elections and the establishment of a government of a united Germany, a four-power conference may take place with the participation of representatives of the all-German government in order to discuss the question of a peace treaty with Germany.Along with this, the 23 September 1952 note of the four powers, as did their previous notes, emphasized that the all-German government must have the freedom to decide on the question of joining “defense” alliances even prior to the conclusion of a peace treaty, and that the decisions of the Potsdam conference with regard to the eastern border of Germany must not be regarded as conclusive.The correspondent for the English newspaper, The Scotsman, Richard Loewenthal, describing the essence of the Western powers' plan in one of his articles, noted that:The West's biggest trump card consists not in responding to the Russian proposal for neutralizing Germany with a dogged insistence on the rights of a united Germany to join alliances, but rather in striving for two-phase negotiations: first, with conferences of the four powers on the question of all-German elections, the establishment of the all-German government and the definition of the powers it would possess in the interim period before the peace treaty; second, with conferences on the peace treaty itself, with the participation of the new German government. In other words, the West must be prepared to discuss at any time the question of German unity, but it must refuse to discuss such conditions for a peace treaty as, for example, neutrality or the eastern border, before a united Germany is established.This tactic, as pointed out by Loewenthal, will not create any dangers for the Western powers and promises substantial benefit for them.Thus, the position of the Western powers had the goal of obstructing a peaceful settlement of the German problem, shifting the responsibility for this on the USSR, and at the same time preserving the division of Germany and expediting the inclusion of West Germany in the aggressive bloc.2. Disagreements in the imperialist camp on the German question at the end of 1952 and the beginning of 1953The increase in American pressure on Western European countries in the matter of ratifying military agreements. Following the dispatch of notes by the three powers to the Soviet Union on 23 September 1952, the government of the USA increased its pressure on the countries of Western Europe, seeking from them the swiftest ratification of the Bonn and Paris agreements.During the last months of its term, the Truman administration on numerous occasions came out with statements regarding the great significance which it attaches to the swiftest implementation of the Bonn and Paris agreements. During these months, the American press completely stopped writing about the possibility of negotiations with the USSR and even ignored the fact that the Soviet Union was not responding to the three powers' note of 23 September. Moreover, the American reactionary newspapers persistently repeated that it was necessary to insure as soon as possible the ratification of the Bonn and Paris agreements. Thus, on 20 October 1952, the American newspapers printed a report from the United Press Agency, which emphasized that the creation of the “European Defense Community” is “the chief goal of United States' foreign policy in Europe and the cornerstone of the Atlantic Alliance.”With the arrival of the Eisenhower administration, the USA's precept for transforming West Germany into the primary base for its aggressive policy in Europe assumed an even more open character. As noted by the American newspaper Chicago Sun-Times,\"people who know Eisenhower's perspective well agree that he considers West Germany to be a more important military asset than France. The newly elected president is regarded as the initiator of German rearmament in the post-war period.\"This position of the Eisenhower administration on the German question is related, in particular, to the fact that one of the most important elements in Eisenhower's election to the presidency was the support of the so-called German group of monopolies in Wall Street, which has large investments in West German industry.The demand to accelerate the ratification of the Bonn and Paris agreements was put forth both in Eisenhower's “State of the Union” address to Congress on 2 February of this year, as well as, in an even more acute form, during the [John Foster] Dulles and [Harold E.] Stassen talks with the governments of the Western European countries between 31 January-9 February of this year. Prior to his departure to Europe, on 27 January of this year, Dulles stated during his radio address:If it so happens that there is no chance for ensuring an effective unity and especially if France, Germany and England go their separate ways, then, undoubtedly, it will be necessary to rethink America's foreign policy toward Western Europe.In contrast to the Truman administration, which, in order to camouflage its positions, continuously emphasized that the implementation of the Bonn and Paris agreements “would not hinder” the establishment of German unity, the Eisenhower administration, during talks with the Western European countries, put forth the thesis that the implementation of these agreements is “a necessary precondition” for German unification. According to a report in the newspaper The New York Times, Dulles, during his visit to Europe, formulated this thesis in the following manner:\"West Germany and Europe must, without paying attention to the Soviet Union, insist on the creation of the European Defense Community if they want to achieve German unification. . . The Kremlin must not have the opportunity to exert influence on the policy of West Germany or control it by playing on proposals for unification. . . It is dangerous and possibly even catastrophic to place hopes on German unification through four-power negotiations.\"Thus, the Eisenhower administration openly stated that it would only allow a German unification that would be based not on agreements with the Soviet Union, but on the forced incorporation of the German Democratic Republic into a rearmed West Germany.During meetings with the heads of the governments of France, West Germany, Italy and the Benelux countries, Dulles and Stassen demanded, as an ultimatum, guarantees that by the regular session of the North Atlantic Alliance council, scheduled for 23 April, these countries would have assured the necessary conditions for the ratification of the Bonn and Paris agreements. From the English government, Dulles and Stassen demanded concessions to France on the question of guarantees against a rearmed West Germany, the provision of which would ease the ratification of the Paris agreement by the French National Assembly.The ratification of the Bonn and Paris agreements by the West German Bundestag. During the last months of 1952 and the beginning of 1953, the Adenauer administration, in complete accordance with American precepts and [the Adenauer administration's] own political plans, relentlessly strove for the ratification of the Bonn and Paris agreements by the Bundestag.Trying to weaken the dissatisfaction of the popular masses and segments of the West German bourgeoisie with the policy of strengthening the division of Germany and including West Germany in the system of the North Atlantic Alliance, the Bonn government and its supporting political parties significantly increased revanchist propaganda and scared the West German population with the “threat from the East.” In his speech in the Bundestag on 2 December 1952, Adenauer blatantly declared that:\"Sacrificing Germany to Soviet Russia--such an alternative would arise as a result of refusing to ratify the agreements.\"The fact that the Social Democratic Party of West Germany continued to speak demagogically against the Bonn and Paris agreements only made it easier for Adenauer to accomplish his plans, since, with their propaganda, the Social Democrats distracted a significant number of West German workers from actively struggling against Adenauer's military policy.In addition to this, hesitations and disagreements arose among the bourgeois circles in West Germany, who had been speaking out in mid-1952 against the Bonn and Paris agreements. The Bavarian Party, under the influence of its right wing, refused to oppose the agreements. The “All-German People's Party,” established in November 1952 by [Gustav] Heinemann and [Helene] Wessel, although it came out against the ratification of the agreements and in favor of German unification, refused to cooperate with the KPD and the “German Unification Movement for Unity, Peace and Freedom,” headed by the former Reich Chancellor [Joseph] Wirth.In this situation, Adenauer was able on 3 December 1952 and 19 March 1953 to push through the Bundestag the second and third versions of the draft legislation for the ratification of the Bonn and Paris agreements.The increase of disagreements in France. At the National Assembly, where the newly formed government of [René] Mayer introduced on 28 January of this year draft legislation for the ratification of the Bonn and Paris agreements, there arose a situation clearly unfavorable for ratification. The majority of deputies at the National Assembly opposed ratification, including many deputies from the governing parties, among them such prominent officials as [Eduard] Herriot, as well as members of RPF , the Gaullist party.Trying to achieve a regrouping of forces at the National Assembly in favor of ratifying the agreements, the Mayer administration undertook a number of foreign policy steps designed to receive from France's partners in the aggressive bloc “security guarantees” for France against German revanchism. With these goals in mind, the Mayer administration in February of this year put forth the so-called “supplemental protocols” to the Paris agreement, which provided for changes in various articles of this agreement that would benefit France and, thus, grant France a privileged position in the “European Defense Community.” In particular, the Mayer administration insisted on France's right to withdraw, according to its judgment, its contingents from the “European army” for use in the colonies, to maintain portions of the French military industry under the control of the French government, as well as to continue payments by the Bonn government for the expense of maintaining French forces in the “European army on West German territory.”However, under pressure from the USA, which supported the negative position of the Bonn government concerning the French supplemental protocols, the Mayer administration was forced in March of this year to renounce the majority of these and agree to a fundamental reexamination of the protocols, which resulted in the dilution of their essential content.Other foreign policy measures of the Mayer administration include a proposal to the English government to establish close cooperation between England and the “European Defense Community” as a guarantee in the instance of a revanchist action by a rearmed West Germany against France. This matter was discussed during English-French negotiations in London on 12 and 13 February of this year. The Churchill government rejected the French proposal, refused to accept concrete obligations, and limited itself only to vague promises.Minister of Foreign Affairs Bidault was forced to accept the unsatisfactory nature of the English response. On 6 March of this year he announced at the National Assembly that:\"We did not present proposals to England, which would be unacceptable. And we refuse to believe that the English government has spoken its final word.\"Finally, the Mayer administration was unable to receive support from the USA in the dispute between France and West Germany on the Saar question, the resolution of which in France's favor could have prompted certain French bourgeois circles to reexamine their negative attitude toward the Bonn and Paris agreements.In connection with the failure of the foreign policy measures of the Mayer administration, the conditions in France for the ratification of the Paris and Bonn agreements were, in the opinion of the foreign press, even more unfavorable by mid-March of this year than in the middle of 1952. Many newspapers expressed the opinion that the government will be entirely unable to achieve a ratification of these agreements and that the plan for creating the “European army” is doomed to complete failure.Under these conditions, in December 1952 the bourgeois press in France had already begun to publish statements in favor of convening negotiations between the Western powers and the Soviet Union on the German question. Thus, on 27 December 1952, the Catholic newspaper Croix emphasized that:“The only possible path to the actual reduction of international tension is a four-power conference.”In January-February 1953, this idea was expressed by several other French newspapers.Discussion among the ruling circles of the USA of the possibility of direct inclusion of West Germany in the organization of the North Atlantic Alliance. In January-February of this year, a number of statements appeared in the American press in favor of direct inclusion of West Germany in the North Atlantic Alliance in the event of a final collapse in the plan for a “European army.” According to evidence available, these statements represent not only blackmail directed at France, but also reflect the actual opinions of American ruling circles.According to unofficial reports from circles of the Canadian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Eisenhower had come to the conclusion that in the event the Bonn and Paris agreements fail to be ratified, a bilateral military agreement should be concluded between the USA and West Germany.According to other unofficial reports, in late January of this year, that is, even prior to Dulles' trip to Western Europe, the Assistant American High Commissioner, [Samuel] Reber, had brought this plan to Adenauer's attention. According to these same reports, Adenauer and Reber came to the conclusion that if the plan for creating the “European army” falls through, then “independent” West German armed forces must be organized, which would be directly included in the “Atlantic army.” During the course of these discussions, it was noted that a number of prominent Hitlerite generals, in particular [Heinz] Guderian and [Franz] Halder, prefer this plan over the project for establishing the “European army.”It is not impossible that the ruling circles in England could support a proposal for direct inclusion of West Germany in the North Atlantic Alliance. In connection with this, it is characteristic that the English conservative newspaper The Daily Telegraph and Morning Post emphasized in its editorial on 23 February of this year that:\"... whatever success may be achieved toward the establishment of the European army, with each passing day it is becoming increasingly clear that a more effective manner of protecting Europe and involving the German army in its defense would be to operate through the organization of the North Atlantic Alliance.\"In February of this year, the foreign press published reports that the USA government had already begun preliminary exchanges of opinions with the English government regarding the creation of “independent” West German armed forces within the parameters of the North Atlantic Alliance.It is certain, however, that if the Americans raised the question of the direct inclusion of West Germany in the North Atlantic Alliance it would bring serious objections from the French government and cause a further deterioration in Franco-American relations.Thus, by the time of the speeches of comrades G. M. Malenkov, L. P. Beria, and V. M. Molotov on 9 March of this year, as well as G. M. Malenkov's speech at the session of the USSR Supreme Soviet on 15 March of this year, there had been serious disagreements on the German question within the imperialist camp.3. The positions of the governments of the Western powers toward negotiations with the Soviet Union on the German question at the present timeFollowing the speeches of Comrades G. M. Malenkov, L. P. Beria, and V. M. Molotov on 9 March and Comrade G. M. Malenkov's speech on 15 March, and following the announcements by the governments of the PRC, KPDR, and the USSR on the Korean question, there was a widespread assumption in the USA and Western European countries that, in the near future, the Soviet government would come out with a proposal for convening a quadripartite conference to discuss the German problem.Thus, for example, the famous American commentators, the ALSOP brothers, wrote on 9 April in the newspaper The New York Herald Tribune:“The next goal for a peace offensive by the Soviets is undoubtedly Germany.”The newspaper of French business circles Information expressed the following conjecture on 11 April:Korea is not the center of the conflict between the East and the West. . . . An agreement may be reached only via settlement of the German problem. . . . The Soviet Union is of course holding several trumps in reserve, which it may put on the table in the near future. Among these trumps, apparently, will be a proposal for convening a quadripartite conference for the reestablishment of German unity.Rumors of an apparently impending proposal from the Soviet Union for convening a quadripartite conference for the discussion of the German question caused serious confusion among the ruling circles in the USA. The ALSOP brothers, describing the attitude of the U.S. State Department toward such a possibility, wrote in the article cited above:The prospect of reinstating negotiations with the Russians on the German question is causing near panic among certain officials... The panic is understandable. Even seemingly serious Soviet proposals for starting negotiations on the conclusion of an acceptable peace treaty with Germany could cause turmoil in the Western alliance. . . This could convince the Germans that only the Americans are hindering the establishment of a united Germany.The famous American journalist [Walter] Lippmann, writing in The New York Herald Tribune on 16 April, characterized the situation, in which the USA government was finding itself, in even more open terms:\"There is nothing . . . that could be adopted as a reliable policy. . . if the Soviet Union goes farther and makes serious proposals for a peace treaty with Germany.\"The main reason for the alarm among the ruling circles of the USA with regard to the allegedly impending announcement by the Soviet Union of new proposals on the German question clearly lies in the fact that such an announcement could result in the failure of American plans to turn West Germany into the strike force of the aggressive bloc. Revealing these apprehensions of the Eisenhower administration, the ALSOP brothers noted on 25 March that “any proposals for Soviet-American negotiations at this time would bury the European army and the new status of Germany.”The English newspaper The Times published on 16 April an article by its special correspondent, which stated:\"Some are venturing to predict that the National Assembly of France will ratify the Paris agreement with a small majority and with numerous conditions, without really believing in it. However, new Russian proposals could refute even this prophecy.\"The position of the English government. The reports of an alleged Soviet government intention to propose the convening of a quadripartite conference on the German question brought more restrained responses in England than in the USA. Some English newspapers raised the question of whether the government should define its position in the instance of such a proposal. Thus, for example, the newspaper The Manchester Guardian wrote on 3 April:\"What would our position be if Russia agrees right now to hold free elections, without raising as a precondition the annulment of the European Defense Community? This is one of the problems that might lie ahead of us in connection with an increased peace offensive.\"The Labor press, in particular the newspaper The Daily Herald, issued a demand that the Churchill government demonstrate initiative and come up with a proposal to convene a quadripartite conference on the German question.On 15 April, the government was asked questions at the House of Commons (apparently, inspired by the administration itself) regarding its position toward negotiations with the USSR on Germany. In response, Minister of State Selwyn Lloyd formulated the official position of the government in the following manner:The opinion of her Majesty's government with regard to convening a four-power conference for the purpose of discussing the question of carrying out free elections throughout all of Germany was brought to the Soviet government's attention in the diplomatic note of 23 September 1952 . . . No reply has been received from the Soviet government; however, these proposals remain in force.Therefore, the English government apparently intends to take a wait-and-see attitude in the near future and not set forth any new conditions for the organization of quadripartite negotiations.Statements in France in favor of organizing quadripartite negotiations. The French bourgeois circles showed increased interest in reports on the possibility of organizing quadripartite negotiations on the German question. As in 1952, those who spoke out in favor of negotiations with the USSR were, first of all, opponents of the plan to establish the “European Defense Community.” The well-known supporter of the “neutralist policy,” chief editor of the newspaper Le Monde, Beuve-Cheri, published in this newspaper an article on 9 April, in which he noted:\"Could it be a real goal of the new German policy to form a united Germany, from which, perhaps, foreign forces would be withdrawn, but which would remain tied with such a system of guarantees that would, in the form in which they are being proposed, signify legal or actual neutralization[?]\" A prominent figure in the “Independent Republican” party, Jacque Bardout, on 21 March declared his intentionto introduce in the Commission on Foreign Affairs a proposal that the French government take upon itself the initiative for holding a four-power conference on the German question.Certain bourgeois circles, which had held a restrained position on this question last year, are also speaking out in favor of negotiations with the USSR. Thus, the newspaper of business circles Information on 9 April expressed the hope that the USA “will not undermine the chances for an actual relaxation of tensions in relations between West and East . . . with the creation of the European army, a necessary condition of which is preservation of the division of Germany.” This same newspaper emphasized on 11 April that if the Soviet Union puts forth a proposal on quadripartite negotiations on the German question, this proposal must not be rejected. The reactionary newspaper Le Figaro, which had always supported the creation of the “European Defense Community,” came out on 4 April with the following statement:\"To a demonstration of aspirations for peace, the West must respond at least with the same demonstration of aspirations for peace . . . There is no need to renounce any negotiations.\"In the French bourgeois camp, the widening of the circle of those who support negotiations with the Soviet Union on the German question is obviously related to the fact that the plan for creating the “European army” is presently at a clear standstill, and that the intention of the Americans to raise the matter of the direct inclusion of West Germany in the North Atlantic Alliance seriously worried even the more reactionary circles of the French bourgeoisie.It is possible that this could also reflect on the French government position on the question of quadripartite negotiations concerning Germany. The question of organizing negotiations with the USSR was raised by French ministers during their visit to the USA in late March of this year. On 25 March, Prime Minister Mayer made the following statement at a press conference in New York:\"I would be happy to find out something about the negotiations with the USSR. France is, of course, counting on being represented at any high-level conference of powers.\"The American newspaper New York World Telegram and Sun wrote during the talks between Mayer and Bidault and members of the Eisenhower administration that:\"Bidault is carefully preparing the ground for convening a conference of the four great powers, which would postpone, and perhaps even completely bury, plans for the European army, which are designed to arm Germany.\"However, the USA government apparently did not give the French ministers any specific assurances of their readiness to agree to convene a four-power conference. In any case, in the communiqué on the results of the Franco-American talks there is no indication of the desirability or the possibility of talks with the USSR; [instead, it] contains rude attacks on the Soviet Union and its foreign policy.In a number of statements following their return from the USA, Mayer and Bidault demonstrated extreme caution on the question of quadripartite negotiations and clearly sought not to reveal their position in the event that the question of such negotiations becomes realistic.The Eisenhower administration's collusion with Adenauer. Among the ruling circles of the Bonn government, the reports of the Soviet Union's alleged preparation of a proposal for quadripartite negotiations raised serious concern. As the American newspaper The New York Herald Tribune reported on 7 April:\"people who are well acquainted with Adenauer and who had heard him in the German Bundestag believe that he is worried by only one thing, and that is precisely the possibility of disturbing West Germany's recently improved status by way of the conclusion of some kind of new agreement at the expense of Germany by West and East--50 percent along the lines of Potsdam. . . For Adenauer, this thought is a real nightmare. His fear of the possibility of such an event probably increased in connection with the current attempts by the Russians at reconciliation with the West.\"The central issue in Adenauer's talks with Eisenhower and members of his administration, which took place in Washington on 7-9 April of this year, was the development of a common line of action for the Bonn government and the government of the USA in the event that the Soviet Union puts forth new proposals for a peaceful settlement of the German problem. The communiqué published at the end of the talks states that, as proof of its “good will” toward “the establishment of peace and cooperation between all countries,” the Soviet government must allow “actual free elections” in Germany and free “the hundreds of thousands” of German prisoners of war and relocated civilians, all of whom are allegedly still in the USSR. The foreign press regards these demands as the U.S.'s preconditions for organizing negotiations between the Western powers and the USSR on the German question.It is significant that this time the government of the USA went beyond those demands, which were put forth in the diplomatic notes of the three Western powers on 10 July and 23 September 1952. The clearly provocative demands for the release of “hundreds of thousands” of prisoners of war, allegedly still detained in the USSR, did not appear in these notes of the Western powers and were obviously introduced at this time by the United States with the direct intention of cutting off avenues toward the organization of quadripartite negotiations on the German question.Aside from this, during the course of talks between Eisenhower and members of his administration on the one side, and Adenauer on the other, specific steps were mentioned, that were directed at expediting the establishment of West German armed forces, independent of the implementation of the agreement on the “European Defense Community.”In this regard, attention should be paid, above all, to Adenauer's statement during a press conference in Washington that, during the time of the talks, there were discussions of such secret questions, of which “even members of the American cabinet” were not informed. The communiqué on the results of the talks states that the government of the USA expressed its readiness to supply arms and equipment to the future armed forces of West Germany, as well as to begin allocating American military requisitions to West Germany. It is true that in both cases the stipulation was made that these measures would be carried out only following the implementation of the Bonn and Paris agreements. However, this stipulation is clearly intended only to legalize the United States' preparations already underway for equipping the West German forces with American arms and the resumption of military production in West German factories.Finally, the communiqué's establishment of the U.S. government's obligations to expedite the review of cases by German war criminals sentenced in American courts, and to allocate special status for the “assistance” of so-called “refugees,” whom the Bonn government regards as the most important source of human resources for the future West Germany army, also testify to the U.S. government's intention to accelerate the establishment of this army.It is characteristic that the reaction in France and England to the results of the Washington talks with Adenauer was highly negative. Paris radio reported on 9 April that:\"The French press is severely condemning Chancellor Adenauer's statements and position (regarding the undesirability of quadripartite negotiations prior to the implementation of the Bonn and Paris agreements--note of the KI) . . . Such a position is equivalent to playing dangerously with fire.\"The famous Labour [Party] activist [Richard] Crossman wrote an article on 17 April in the daily New Statesman and Nation, which declared that:\"It is significant that Adenauer believes himself to be sufficiently strong to act in this manner--hindering a relaxation of tensions, even if England and France desire it . . . The Germans are completely in favor of a cold war . . . They are convinced that once the Federal Republic rearms they will be able, with help from Dulles, to compel the weak-nerved French and English to accept a real liberation policy.\"The German question in Eisenhower's speech on 16 April. Eisenhower's speech at the American Society of Newspaper Editors on 16 April once more confirmed that the USA government does not want and will try not to allow negotiations with the Soviet Union on the German question. In this aggressive speech, Eisenhower counted the German question among those “serious and specific disputed questions between the free world and the Soviet Union,” the possibility of settling which can only be examined after “the conclusion of an honored armistice in Korea;” he defined [this] as not only a cessation of military actions in Korea, but also as “a cessation of direct and indirect infringements on the security of Indo-China and Malaya.” Even this one definition of the question already demonstrates that the Eisenhower administration intends to reject all proposals for convening a quadripartite conference on the German question.Further, Eisenhower emphasized that “a free and united Germany, with a government established on the basis of free elections with secret balloting,” must be included in the “European Community.” In another portion of his speech, he repeated Dulles' previously formulated thesis that West German participation in the “European Defense Community” “is the only safe path toward complete and irrevocable unity” for Germany. At the same time, Eisenhower let it be known that the U.S. government will agree to such unification of Germany which would provide for united Germany's participation in the military-political bloc of the Western powers.Finally, a characteristic peculiarity of Eisenhower's presentation of the German question was the complete absence of even a mention in his speech of a peace treaty with Germany.Thus, the current position of the government of the USA toward quadripartite negotiations on the German question differs significantly from the position put forth in the note of the three powers on 23 September 1952. By surrounding the organization of such negotiations with clearly provocative “preconditions,” the Eisenhower administration is obviously trying to block the organization of quadripartite negotiations on the German question.As demonstrated by the above reports, this position of the USA government will inevitably lead to a further escalation of disagreements between the USA and Western European countries.I.

      "TELEGRAM 066502To: the Romanian Ministry of Foreign AffairsFrom: the Romanian Embassy in Pyongyang Date: April 4, 1977 Classification: SecretKim Il Sung congratulates all Koreans– “revolutionaries, democratic patriots, studious youth and the other social classes,” and the 600,000 fellow countrymen that live in Japan, and the fellow countrymen outside of Korea’s borders - that fight the reprisals of American imperialism and its lackeys, [to promote] democratic liberties and the unification of the country.In 1976 the Six-Year Plan’s tasks were completed and [the quotas] were exceeded in all the economic sectors, including the production of steel, 4 million tons, and concrete, 8 million tons. Remarkable results were obtained in agriculture: over 8 million tons of cereal; the internal situation was very tense after the incident caused by the American imperialists in August 18th 1976 in Panmunjom.For the first time the Central Committee of the Workers’ Party of Korea decided that 1977 will be a buffer year in order to solve some difficulties in the transportation and extraction industries, the planning of the next six year plan, and the necessary preparations for starting a new long-term plan. Adequate measures were adopted.The situation in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea remains tense.Kim Il Sung mentions that with the passing of the years the reunification of Korea is more and more necessary.In 1976, relations with the Third World countries improved. Participants of the fifth high-level conference at Colombo expressed solidarity for Korea’s reunification. Many committees that are united with the fight of the Koreans have been formed. There is more support for South Korea in its fight for democracy against fascism.Regarding the tasks assigned for 1977, efforts will be made to improve relations with socialist countries, Third World countries and the progressive countries of the world. All the citizens should intensify their fight for the reunification of the country.An emphasis is put on the task to get the USA to sign a peace agreement, which would lead to a more auspicious phase for reunification.Regarding the message’s content, we noticed it dealt primarily with internal economic problems – accomplishments and tasks. Our attention was drawn to the fact that, compared to last year, there are no assessments of the political situation in the region as well as no mention of international issues. At the same time, time after time and on various occasions, the leadership cadres of the DPRK mention that the Korean question is poorly known in Europe and that there is insufficient support for the cause of the reunification of Korea.\n",

      "TELEGRAM 066560To: the Romanian Ministry of Foreign AffairsFrom: the Romanian Embassy in Pyongyang Subject: the current concerns of Democratic People’s Republic of Korea about agricultureDate: April 5, 1977 Classification: Secret One of the main internal concerns of the Korean party and state’ leadership is the agriculture. The call made by the President Kim Il Sung, “agriculture first,” is still on.From the beginning of the year an intense activity is carried out in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to achieve the tasks set by the 12th Plenum of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea in October 1976. It approved the 5-point plan of natural environment modification as well as the call upon [the members] of the Workers' Party of Korea at the beginning of the current year to obtain 8.5 million tons of cereal in 1977.Completing these tasks will allow the accomplishment of one of the ten points of the development plan – obtaining 10 million tons of cereal. An emphasis is put on the prevention of the cold air front and drought. In this context, the agricultural year of 1976, when the peasantry cooperative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea obtained the biggest harvest in the history of the country – 8 million tons of cereal – in spite of unfavorable climatic conditions, is given as an example.In many articles and commentaries on the radio and television, an emphasis is put on the importance of the help offered by the working class to the peasantry. This support is appreciated as a “logical requirement for the consolidation of the working class-peasantry alliance,” “a main condition for the quick development of the agriculture,” and “a contribution to the acceleration of the abolition of the differences between the rural and the urban lifestyle”.After solving problems related to the irrigation and the electrification of agriculture in May, there are now new tasks regarding the chemicalization and complex mechanization for the modernization and the industrialization of agriculture.In his New Year message in 1977, Kim Il Sung highlighted the great successes obtained by the Korean people in accomplishing the tasks set by the Plenum of the Central Committee of the Workers’ Party of Korea in October 1976. In the last 2 months of the previous year, the surface of irrigated land has increased by 82,000 hectares,2,600 hectares have been terraced, and over 14,600 hectares of new lands have been utilized.Nutritive pots for corn are currently being prepared, the rice for seedlings sowing has started, and there is a large activity for pumping increased quantities of water in the accumulation lakes.From materials published by the [North Korean] press, discussions with the locals and personal observation, there is an accentuated drought during the first trimester that affects un-irrigated land and leads to difficulties in the electric energy production and industrial production. A drought is foreseen for the next period as well.Currently there is an intense activity to accelerate the spring agricultural work and to prevent the evaporation of the soil’s humidity.\n",

      "In early April, a DPRK goodwill delegation visited Ethiopia. They conducted negotiations with the emperor and the premier, too. They also reached an agreement in principle on the establishment of diplomatic relations. They asked the Ethiopian government to support the issue of Korean unification at the next UN General Assembly.According to the information provided by the Koreans, the negotiations were held in a friendly atmosphere. Their delegation was in contact with the Chinese embassy. On the last day of their visit, they visited the Soviet ambassador, and briefly informed him.At the other socialist embassies, including ours, they left only a message that they had no time to contact us.  [illegible signature]\n",

      "MAO ZEDONG AND PHAM VAN DONG, VO NGUYEN GIAPBeijing, 11 April 1967Pham Van Dong: We are very glad to see you healthy, Chairman Mao.Mao Zedong: Just normal, not very well…Among all of you here, is there anyone from the South?Vo Nguyen Giap: Comrade Pham Van Dong is a Southerner.Pham Van Dong: My native village is in Quang Ngai province [in central Vietnam], where people are fighting the enemy very well.Vo Nguyen Giap: Only in one year, people in Quang Ngai shot down almost 100 helicopters.  They are fighting the puppet troops, [and] American and South Korean troops very well.Mao Zedong: As you are fighting, you have drawn experience, you have come to understand the rule.  If you are not fighting you will not have experience, will not know the rule...  It looks more or less similar to your resistance against the French.Pham Van Dong: We are now better than that and the fighting now is fiercer.Mao Zedong: So, I said you now know the rule.Pham Van Dong: We just began to do so.Mao Zedong: It is a matter of course that in the process, changes can occur.  The most difficult years were from 1956 to 1959…In 1960 there were some good changes.  From 1960 to 1961, the armed forces were still small.  But in 1963 and 1964, the situation changed.  And now, in 1965 and 1966, you have better understanding of the rule, based on your experiences fighting against French, Japanese, and now American troops.  You also fought the Japanese, didn’t you?Vo Nguyen Giap: Yes, we did, but not much; only in a small scale guerrilla warfare.  In our fighting against the Americans, we always remember your words: try to preserve and develop our forces, steadfastly advancing forward.Mao Zedong: We have a saying: “if you preserve the mountain green, you will never have to worry about firewood.”  The US is afraid of your tactics.  They wish that you would order your regular forces to fight, so they can destroy your main forces.  But you were not deceived.  Fighting a war of attrition is like having meals: [it is best] not to have too big a bite.  In fighting the US troops, you can have a bite the size of a platoon, a company, or a battalion.  With regard to troops of the puppet regime, you can have a regiment-size bite.  It means that fighting is similar to having meals, you should have one bite after another.  After all, fighting is not too difficult an undertaking.  The way of conducting it is just similar to the way you eat.…I was told that you wanted to build a new 100 km railway, do our Chinese counterparts agree to help you?Zhou Enlai: We have had discussions on the issue.  Some people will be sent [to Vietnam] to make a feasibility study.Mao Zedong: It is not too long, shorter than the distance from Beijing to Tianjin.Pham Van Dong: We will make the feasibility study together with Chinese comrades.Mao Zedong: It’s all right, for the sake of war.  What about the matter of food supply?Zhou Enlai: We discussed this with Comrade Li Xiannian.[1]  We will provide 100 thousand tons of rice, 50 thousand tons of maize.Pham Van Dong: So, this year alone, China helped Vietnam with approximately 500 thousand tons of food.  This help is very great.Mao Zedong: We can help you.  Last year we had good crops.Pham Van Dong: Thank you, Chairman Mao.Mao Zedong: If you want to say thanks, you should say it to our peasants…Later, when you have dinner with Comrade Zhou, you can ask Comrade Wei Guoqing how he was criticized by the Red Guards.  I know comrade Wei because he often visits and reports to me when he comes back from working visits to Vietnam.  Who is now the new [Vietnamese] ambassador?Zhou Enlai: Comrade Ngo Minh Loan.[2]Mao Zedong: Which [Chinese] character is [Loan]?Zhu Qiwen: Phoenix-like.Mao Zedong: This kind of bird is very strong.Pham Van Dong: Comrade Loan will try his best to continue the job by Comrade Tran Tu Binh,[3] that is, to strengthen the friendship between the two countries.Mao Zedong: I am sorry that Comrade Tran Tu Binh passed away.Pham Van Dong: We are also very sad about it.Mao Zedong: What kind of illness did he have?Pham Van Dong: The same illness he had before and after he came back home, he was too busy.Vo Nguyen Giap: He passed away after having a serious cold.  He was in the same hospital with ambassador Zhou Qiyun.Zhu Qiwen: The Friendship Hospital.  I also have a record of high blood pressure.Pham Van Dong: Today, we would like to pay a courtesy visit to you, Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin [Biao] and other comrades.  Once again, thank you very much.  ....Mao Zedong: You have been bravely struggling both in the North and in the South.Pham Van Dong: It’s because we are learning Chairman Mao’s military thinking.Mao Zedong: [It is] not necessary.  Without it, you still can gain victory.  In the past, you were fighting the Japanese, the French.  Now you are fighting the Americans.Pham Van Dong: Thanks to the military policy of our Party and also to Mao Zedong’s military thinking.....Vo Nguyen Giap:  As I remember, at one time during our resistance war against the French, Comrade Zhou sent president Ho a telegram that read: “Now is not the right time to have a peaceful solution.  You should continue fighting.”  [Ed. note: Giap refers to late 1949 or January 1950.]Zhou Enlai: At that time, the French were going to recognize us.  But because we recognized Vietnam they ignored us.  As Lenin taught, big countries have the responsibility to encourage the world revolution.  At that time revolution was victorious in Russia, so Lenin thought of China and India.  Now, Lenin’s desire has been half-realized: the Chinese revolution has been successful.  Yet, reality has not developed the way people want it to be.  Some smaller countries gained victory earlier.  Victory in Korea is followed by the one in Vietnam.[1] Li Xiannian was a member of the CCP Politburo, and vice premier and finance minister of the PRC.[2] Ngo Minh Loan was an alternate member of the VWP CC 1960-76, and Vietnamese ambassador to Beijing 1967-69.  Had been Vice-Minister of Light Industry 1959-67.  In 1968 visited Pakistan as “special envoy” and held talks with President Ayub Khan.  From 1969-71 Minister of Food and Foodstuffs, ranked as minister up to 1976.[3] Tran Tu Binh (alias Pham Van Phu) (1907-67), long-standing member of ICP, Inspector General of PAVN for three years during the First Indochina War.  Succeeded Hoang Van Hoan as DRV ambassador to China in 1957 and served until his death in 1967;

Originally you were going to return on the 12th or 13th, right?Kang Ku-yeong [Kang Ku-yong] (hereafter abbreviated as Kang): We were a few days late in returning. We came back to Beijing on the 15th.Premier: How many days all together did you spend out there?Kang: It was something like 8 or 9 days.Premier: You went to which areas？Kang: We went to Hainan Island, Guangzhou, Hangzhou, and Shanghai.Premier: You did not go to Wuhan?Cao Ying: We did not go to Wuhan.Kang: How is the Comrade Premier’s health?Premier: Very good. How are Premier Kim and Chairman Choe [Yong-geon, Yong-gon]?Kang: They are both very good. Just before leaving to come here, Premier Kim made a point of telling me to give his regards to the Premier.Premier: I thank him.Kang: We have learned many things this time in coming to China.Premier: You came to make a tour. What did you learn?Kang: Even though time was very short on this visit, we certainly saw and learned many things.Premier: What things did you see? Kang: We toured a people’s commune in Guangzhou, and on Hainan Island we visited the Xinglong farm.Premier: That is something that the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office started. It produces very good coffee. I went there once (to Zhang Yingwu: Have you gone there? Zhang: I have not gone there.).Kang: The rubber trees grow very well there. Premier: Was or was there not grass in the rubber plantation? Was it hoed clean?Kang: We saw it. It was very cleanly hoed.Premier: Have they started the tapping the rubber trees yet? Now is the time that they tap the rubber trees.Kang: I saw rubber for the first time. Usually I would not know about this kind of thing. But as far as I can see, the rubber trees there are growing very well. According to the introduction from the comrades, in another two to three or three to four years they will be able to tap a great amount of sap. Premier: Some of the rubber trees on the Xinglong farm are old, already seven or eight years old, perhaps. There are also some new ones there. One has to take care to protect them. This kind of tree is very delicate. The grass must be hoed clean, particularly the lemon-grass, because it can absorb the fertilizer from the soil, or the tree is going to wither and die. When it is time to clear an area for cultivation, one cannot do so roughly. For example, in using a tractor one will not take care of the roots cleanly, or the grass. The trees will then be unable to grow well and could even wither and die. We had no experience in the past with making rubber. As for the material, at the start the Soviet Union wanted to cooperate with us (which was kind of them) and help us make the rubber. They then sent us some experts. They did not understand what they were doing, made arbitrary suggestions, put in some machinery, without any good result, doing it the wrong way. Later, overseas Chinese from Asian countries to the south, where they produce rubber, such as Indonesia and Malaya, returned to China. Understanding the basis for planting rubber trees, they managed to do it. In 1958-1959, however, some comrades in the Ministry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation took a subjective view of the matter, wanted to proceed quickly, were not methodical, and advocated large-scale clearing of the land for cultivation. The result was that land in the western part of Hainan Island was cleared on a large scale. Too much land was cleared. But the land was not deeply cleared, so tree roots remained in the ground. The result was that the transplanted saplings were affected by the old roots and could not grow. The large-scale clearing of land for cultivation resulted in removing trees that could have served as a windbreak. When typhoons came, the delicate trees could not stand. Much land was cleared and many trees were planted, but their survival rate was low. In the final tally, part of it was written off, requiring us to do it over again. You can see that wanting to do a great deal resulted, on the contrary, in not accomplishing much. Perhaps the reason that the Xinglong farm that you saw is better is that this farm was established a little earlier, the overseas Chinese also had experience, there were windbreaks, and they protected the rubber trees well. At present we have planted rubber trees on the mainland, across from Hainan Island, in the Zhanjiang area. The current total area is around 200,000 to 300,000 chongbo (You use the chongbo as your domestic unit of measurement, right? One chongbo is equal to 15 mu.). Previously they wanted to go too quickly, wanting to do 600,000 chongbo. This is not such an easy thing to do. How to plant the trees, the manpower, the saplings, etc., are all problems. So, from the start in 1951 until the present time, it has already taken 13 years to do it.The growth of something new is not smooth sailing. One always has to feel one’s way slowly, repeating things many times, experimenting many times, and finally finding a better way to do it. Speaking of that, the great mistake we made two times both came from good intentions. The first time was when Stalin was still alive. We wanted to make rubber, so avoiding buying it from capitalist countries. This came from good intention. But we had no experience. Where were the Soviet Union’s rubber trees? There were none. The experts pretended to know what they did not know. It was subjectivism. The second time, we ourselves wanted to do a great deal. The second time it was us ourselves. We wanted to do a great deal. It was comrades of the Ministry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation who did it. There was subjectivism. Once the activity was under way, there was also commandism. They wanted much, but the result was not much.We learned a lesson from this: Treat new things always as going from the unknown to the known. Thus, in putting something into practice, one must take care to feel one’s way and take care to tally one’s experiences. It is not possible not to make mistakes, but the numbers of errors committed are different. Take care, and the errors will be smaller. If not, they will be greater. One must ceaselessly sum up both the correct and the incorrect. One must do so over and over again. Only then can one produce a relatively fruitful method. Anything new has this problem. One must take a welcoming attitude regarding new things. Regarding conditions for producing new things, first of all one must welcome them. Do not be afraid to make mistakes; be afraid not do commit them. Seek out experience; then it will be possible not to make mistakes. This is probably a more appropriate attitude. Other than that, there are two attitudes that are not worth adopting. One is, upon encountering some difficulty, to grow discouraged and negative, and cease wanting to do something. This is an error of the Right. It is conservative thinking. Another is not to admit one’s error, to insist on doing things one’s way, the errors growing larger the more one makes them, in result affecting the new things, which do not develop. This is an error of the Left. It, too, is not worth adopting.Of course, this is an error of the Left or Right. It is part of the contradictory nature of the party and the people. Contemporary revisionism is not like this. They are a complete mess and come with ulterior motives. One example is that of [Nikita] Khrushchev’s method in regard to Cuba. It is to ask that Cuba produce more sugar cane and less food. His reasoning is this: The market price for sugar is high, there is more sugar produced, and money is spent to purchase food. In fact, Khrushchev’s way with regard to Cuba is a continuation of the past method of US imperialism’s economic monoculture, turning Cuba into a supply base for sugar, providing the Soviet Union with sugar to eat. Colonialism with regard to Latin America has thus adopted such a way! They tell people where to plant coffee, where to plant sugar, where to plant cocoa, where to raise livestock. They specialize entirely in agriculture in the service of the United States, which industrializes, making every country of Latin America depend on the industrialization of the United States. Europe’s old colonialists, too, are like this with regard to Africa and Asia. The Soviet Union’s Khrushchev, too, at present is of the same attitude, having Cuba specialize in sugar, Bulgaria specialize in fruit, and Romania specialize in grain crops and animal feed. Now, if there is not enough food, then what is to be done? He says that he can supply it. But you know that Soviet agriculture was made chaotic by Khrushchev. This is not some kind of conservatism. It is really and truly an ideology of acting blindly. Simply, it is blindly making a mess of things. The Soviet Union from last year to this year has imported 13 million to 14 million tons of food, and it still continues importing. How can it supply food to these countries? Because of this, Cuba increases sugar production, but the production of food decreases. Cuba does not have food; the Soviet Union cannot supply it. It would be better to buy it from us. In addition, there is also food to buy on international markets. We have bought Cuban sugar and sold food to them, but we cannot but tell them: You still have to grow your own food to avoid buying food from afar. If not, once something happens it will be very dangerous. The Soviet Union buys Cuba’s sugar and gives Cuba what? Machinery. It is necessary for Cuba to use machinery to grow sugar cane, and not only for cultivation, but machinery is used even for harvesting. The Soviet Union does not grow sugar cane, so where does it have such experience? It is said that mechanized harvesting is very problematic. The machinery is so large and so cumbersome, and the sugar cane is so tall. The machinery cannot but move forward, resulting in much thrown away.At present the Soviet Union’s steel production is very high, but the machinery produced from it has no sales market. The West does not buy it, and our trade volume has also dropped. There is nothing to be done about it. The result is a flood of production to export, which brings misfortune to others! A Romanian delegation came to China and said that they do not want to buy the Soviet Union’s machinery, and that the West’s machinery is inexpensive, modernized, highly productive, and able to save manpower. The Soviet Union’s machinery is cumbersome, backward, and expensive. East Germany, because West Germany would not supply machine parts, had no choice but to buy from the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union wants East Germany to change the machinery into the Soviet type: cumbersome and backward. East Germany does not want to change and still imports from the West. The Czechs are even more reluctant to use Soviet machinery. They long ago entered into business transactions with the West. As for Cuba, because there is a great deal of sugar on the international market, its price is low. At the same time, Cuba also suffers under the US blockade and has no choice but to buy from other countries. It has to import machinery from the Soviet Union. Of course, there are some things that they need, such as oil. Therefore, with economic monoculture Cuba not only depends on the Soviet Union for industry but must also depend on the entire world for food. This is extraordinarily dangerous. Once trouble occurs, such as the United States carrying out a total blockade or causing disturbances, one would run into many difficulties to staying the course, not a reduction in difficulties. This is entirely not the attitude of fraternal countries, of socialist countries. It is entirely that of colonialism! That is to say, contemporary revisionism is leading to the restoration of capitalism in its own country; towards the capitalist developed nations, its adopted policy is one of social democracy; towards the Asian, African, and Latin American countries that are newly independent or not yet independent, it adopts neocolonialist policy.I have just spoken of an error with two natures. One kind is that of popular internal contradiction in nature. In approaching new things, one will at times commit errors of the Right and at times commit errors of the Left. In these instances, both errors can be corrected. In their nature, they are internal to the Party and the people. The second part to discuss is the contradictory nature between the enemy and ourselves, which is no longer something internal to the people. But the present method of resolution is not for dealing with contradiction among the people, because the problem is very complicated. The absolute majority of the people in the country led by the party of contemporary revisionism is revolutionary and socialist. So, at the time of Khrushchev’s birthday, he had to issue a telegram. You all saw it. (Kang: We saw it.) In the telegram there was talk of major events, of future prospects, of friendship between peoples. This is what was said to their party members and people. I do not know whether he published it or not. Possibly he understood and did not publish it. I have heard that at present it still has not been published. But if you do not publish it, we can broadcast it. Some people who would be able to hear it.I have talked about error of two natures, and started the talk from rubber. I am sorry for talking so much. China has a saying: “Seize on an issue to beat one’s own drum.” In brief, one can see the problem of error of two natures. A country led by a Marxist-Leninist party is also capable of committing error. But it does so with good intentions, or it is an error of the people’s internal nature. Now, contemporary revisionism in paying lip service to supposedly helping others commits not a common error, but one that harms others and is contrary to internationalism. There is another point. We say that aid is always mutual and has always been this way. But contemporary revisionism believes that everything is its helping others. For example, [Mikhail] Suslov’s report spoke at great length on aid to China. He simply did not understand to what extent it helped. Also, learning has always been mutual. Each side has its strengths and weaknesses. One must remove one’s own weaknesses and learn from the strengths of others. However, contemporary revisionism has never learned from the good experience of fraternal countries but has always wanted others to learn from it. At present it wants to learn capitalist methods. It really admires and tries to imitate capitalism. The United States and Britain are thus quite pleased, saying that Khrushchev is very intelligent in adopting the capitalist method and confirming that the socialist method failed.Britain’s prime minister has also said the following: These days, the division of the world into East and the West is past. It should be divided into North and South. Those in the North are all advanced, civilized countries, and all are white, namely, Britain, the United States, Germany, the Soviet Union, Canada, and so on. Here, he intentionally excluded France. It is not yet decided whether to include France or not. He said: The South is all uncivilized countries, undeveloped in industry and backwards, and all are colored. That is to say that the Arab world, Africa, Asia, and Latin America are all together considered the South. All are regarded as backwards and uncivilized. This is the height of absurdity! In fact, this is Western imperialism promoting racism and implementing a policy of racial discrimination. But what he said also has a flaw: Are not the rulers of South Africa, as well as those of such countries as Australia and New Zealand, all in the South? And are they all not white people? Thus imperialism, in order to draw in the Soviet Union, will use anything and has put forth ill-founded things.Well, I have gone on for some time and said a great many things. In addition, taking advantage of this opportunity, there is something that I would like to ask of you.We have helped you do some projects. I do not know whether or not there has been subjectivism. I do not know whether there have been or not things not suited to your needs, including in the area of cultural cooperation. Please look into it. Commonly in cooperation we have subjectivism, things not suiting needs, a conservative or irritated tone. Taking things that have not yet matured, that one has still not done well oneself, one forces them upon others. Machinery and equipment that do not conform to the norm are sent. I hope that you can tell me what you know. If you do not really understand, go back and look into it. You must investigate it. After that, it would be fine if inform me directly or inform our ambassador or cultural counsellor. This would be a great help to us. One cannot see entirely clearly regarding one's own actions. It is always easy to see their good side. In regard to the incorrect aspect, one often overlooks it or is unwilling to look at it. One must help others.Kang: As far as I know, we have not discovered such things. In respect to culture, we, the Comrade Counsellor, and China’s Committee for Foreign Cultural Relations are working well together. Henceforth, we will act in accordance with what the Comrade Premier has said.Premier: You perhaps have not yet taken note of the problem, so you have yet to discover it. I now request that you inform the chairman of your Committee for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and the Minister of Culture. In the area of cultural cooperation, once you discover our error, let us know.This will make us good comrades and good friends. At present you, and your two delegation comrades as well, if you become aware of something, let me know. That would be even better.Kang: In this regard, I have not discovered or felt anything. We felt sorry, in fact, for frequently needing the help of the China Committee for Foreign Cultural Relations, making many requests, and being a burden.Premier: What are you saying? Is there something for which you should feel sorry? You have the right to ask, because you are at the forefront, face-to-face with US imperialism. In working, a great deal must be put into the fight against the enemy. Therefore, in respect to culture, for a time it is also possible that we will do little. There are limits. China, this great power, is also in the rear. We must help you, and you have the right to ask. We have the duty to supply you with every kind of material.You are doing very good work! Last year at the 1st Games of the New Emerging Forces, held in Jakarta, the song and dance troupe that you sent was outstanding. Last year, on the fifteenth anniversary of the founding of your Republic, you put on an art exhibition of over 3,000 persons. There were over 30,000 persons at the same time who participated in the mass games performance. It was truly a magnificent scene. Therefore, of the Chinese comrades who have been to Korea, there has not been a single one who has not praised it. I have only seen a film clip of it, which was extraordinarily grand, magnificent, and extraordinarily militant. This year is the fifteenth anniversary of our country’s founding. I can tell you that we fundamentally have nothing like that, cannot imagine it, and cannot produce it. Although we have lofty aspirations and high aims, we cannot realize it. Is or is there not a venue for it? There is. The Great Hall of the People’s stage can accommodate at least 2,000 persons, the Banquet Hall can accommodate at least 3,000 persons, and the [Workers’] Stadium can accommodate 30,000. But organizing such a performance of song and dance, from the composers to the performers, the singing and the dancing, we are not capable of it. Why is it that you can do it? We have to examine this. This is your country, in a combat environment, face-to-face with the enemy, the Party and state with a single call, the masses responding with extraordinary speed, resolute in their will, with great organization and discipline. This is your character. You can gather together in a moment. Of course, the lines of communication are short and easy, but this is not the main point. We want to perform with three or five thousand persons. As for the numbers, we can gather them together, but they would not be at the same level. Even the sound would not be the same. There would be a mix of northern and southern accents, which would not sound good. In dance there is every kind. There is the purely regional in color, the classical, the Western, the neither local nor Western, everything. Doing it all together, it is ugly. (Cao: Our costumes, too, are ugly. There is no unity in our costumes.) I am not talking here about appearance. If I were to talk about appearance, there is no unity in costume and it is ugly. What I have said is no more than form. The content of the thinking, too, is uneven. Of course, for the form the composer or director makes it uniform but cannot imagine the movement that concentrated and united or the will that strong. They come from every corner of China, with different levels of understanding and different degrees of accepting the Party’s policies. As we can see, the matter appears to be easy, but in reality it is not that easy!Kang: What we did last year also had many faults. We think that if the Chinese comrades had done it, they would have been better than us. Premier: It is not that we lack lofty aspirations and high aims, but in thinking a bit about it, this matter is not so easy. Do you have to return to Korea the day after tomorrow?Kang: Yes. This time, to tell the truth, we really learned many things.Premier: There are areas, such as medical matters, where one can still study, but analysis is also necessary. Of course, one can also draw lessons from one’s faults. We have made mistakes. You perhaps have not made them.Kang: On this trip to China, since Deputy Director Cao Ying and Department Director Zhang Yingwu have taken great care of us and have attentively arranged everything, we feel as though we were in our own house.Premier: It should seem as though one were in one’s own house, what one calls “generations-long friendship between two families,” where the two families are as one.Kang: Every place we went, Chinese comrades all warmly received us. Through this, we deeply understood how profound is the friendship of the Chinese people for the Korean people. Premier: In this respect, the people of our two countries respect and are friendly to one another. Which of you delegation members manages film? (None of them manages film. One is a musician; another is a section chief in the Korean Committee for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries.) Not long ago our people wanted to go to Korea and film “Red Propagandist.” They went there very quickly. I hope that you relay to your Committee for Foreign Cultural Relations chairman, culture minister, and government (I believe that you will make it convenient for them.) that, while they are there working, to tell them directly of any shortcoming, such as in shooting scenes or filming, as with a brother, you must tell them to their face of any shortcomings. In any case, as foreigners there will be much that they will not understand. I ask the comrades of the Korean Committee for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, the Culture Ministry, and those managing film to give a great deal of guidance and not be formal. We hope, through the images of the Chinese comrades, to introduce to the Chinese people the building of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, the Cheollima [Chollima] Movement, and the Cheongsan-ri [Chongsan-ri] Spirit. This is a joint matter, so I hope that you will tell us.I have already spoken with Chairman Choe, Vice Chairman Ri Hyo-sun, and Foreign Minister Pak of our two countries shooting a film together. It seems that we may have to go next year (the only film this year is “Red Propagandist”), because it is now already April, and we still do not have a script. As for the script, if the Korean comrades can write it, we would very much welcome it. This film would best be written on the War of Resistance against Japan, because our two countries’ comrades all took part in it. Perhaps Chinese comrades would play Chinese and Korean comrades would play Koreans. Together in one film, they would show that the concerted action in the revolutionary struggle of that time. Please return and inform Premier Kim of my thinking on this. Kang: I will certainly inform him.Premier: I think that the Korean comrades certainly will write the script, because many Korean comrades joined the Anti-Japanese United Army. I expounded to Chairman Choe on the Anti-Japanese United Army that it was a united anti-Japanese army of Korean and Chinese comrades. Not a few Korean comrades, under the leadership of Premier Kim, joined the Anti-Japanese United Army. Among them will be persons to write a good script. (to our accompanying persons: Have we not put on a Korean drama? Which one is it? Zhang Yingwu: It was the play “Red Flag,” which we put on last year.)Kang: Here we are relying on Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army veterans to search and gather materials, but we still have not gathered some of them. I am afraid that we will have to rely on the Chinese comrades.Premier: You can send some someone here. However, we here no longer have many men left from the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army. You know that Comrade Zhou Baozhong passed away not long ago. Of course, some still remain, such as Comrade Feng Zhongyun and Comrade Li Yanlu, but they are not many.Kang: Comrade Premier, as busy as you are, you have spent so much of your valuable time speaking with us on so many and such important matters. We are very grateful.Premier: I spoke as I pleased, seizing on an issue to beat one’s own drum.Kang: On my return I will certainly report what the Premier has said.Premier: Next time you come you have to tell me where our work is lacking. It will not do if you do not say anything. If you do not come, then when other comrades come they have to tell me. If I see them, I will have to ask them. Kang: I will certainly strive to do so.Premier: Thank you, we have made an appointment for the next meeting.Kang: I wish Comrade Premier good health.Premier: When you return, please give my regards to Premier Kim Il Sung, Chairman Choe Yong-geon, and other leading comrades of Korea’s party and government.Kang: I will certainly convey them.Distribution: Office of Foreign Affairs (3), Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Investigation Department, International Liaison Department, Central Propaganda Department, Organization Department.Academy of Sciences, China Association for Science and Technology, Ministry of Culture, Ministry of Higher Education, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Health, Physical Culture and Sports Commission, New China News Agency, All-China Journalists Association, China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, China Writers Association, Broadcast Administration, State Bureau of Religious Affairs, China Islamic Association, Department of Philosophy and Social Sciences、China Foreign Languages Publishing Administration (3), International, China State Construction Engineering Corporation, Foreign Languages Bookstore.Zhang, Chu, Zhi, Ding, Qu, Cao, Chen, Zhou, General Office (2), First Department (2), Second Department, Third Department, Fourth Department, Fifth Department, Propaganda Department, Foreign Aid Department, International Organizations and Conferences Department, Research Office, Exchanges, Speeches, Cadres Office, Party Affairs Office, Archives Office.Chinese-Soviet Friendship Association, Exhibition Workshop.   Three copies retained.

      "The Belgian Ambassador [emphasis in the original] of this place informed me that in an evening in the middle of last week, in the vicinity of the Northern Railroad Station in Bucharest, three cars with diplomatic plates suddenly surrounded the car driven by him and forcibly brought it to a stop. In the dusk he could see only that persons from some Far Eastern country got out of the cars and attempted to drag him out of his car. After a brief scuffle it became clear that the assailants were unable to achieve this aim, whereupon they jumped into their cars and drove off at a high speed. The ambassador immediately reported the incident to the Romanian F[oreign] M[inistry], specifying the registration numbers of two of the assailing cars. On 17th of this month the FM told him that the identification [of the cars] had been completed: the vehicles in question were owned by the DPR Korean [sic] Embassy in Bucharest; he also received a [written] acknowledgement from the ambassador of this country about that the action was indeed carried out by Korean cars. Despite the news aired in the Western press, the Belgian ambassador does not think that [the North Koreans] intended to kidnap a diplomat; he is also aware of that the assault was not directed against him, he was merely mistaken for an American person. As the ambassador told me, a member of the American Embassy in Bucharest recently also suffered a similar insult in the Romanian capital.– Martin – 196 –\n",

      "For ReferenceNo.1April 28, 1955CatalogueThe Taiwan IssueIke says to correspondents that the USA is willing to hold direct negotiations with New ChinaBritain wishes to be a loyal mediator between New China and the USABurmese newspapers’ comments on Taiwan issueThe Asian-African Conference Issue    Kotalawela’s[1] comment on the Asian-African Conference    Comments of the prime ministers of India, Pakistan and Egypt on the Asian-African Conference    Burmese newspapers’ comments on the Asian-African ConferenceThe Taiwan IssueIke says to correspondents that the USA is willing to hold direct negotiations with New China    According to the AFP news from Washington, Eisenhower said to correspondents on April 27 that the American Government was ready to hold direct discussions with Communist China on all issues which would adequately lead to the relaxation of international tension except for the issues directly relating to Kuomintang[2] China.    The American president said that he completely agreed with Dulles’s statement issued yesterday, i.e. the USA was willing to hold direct negotiations with Peking on the truce in Taiwan Straits.    Eisenhower said that last Saturday’s announcement of the State Department Communiqué probably made a wording mistake that Kuomintang China must participate in all the talks relating to the Taiwan region.    He said that as for Kuomintang China, the truce in the Taiwan region was purely an empty talk as the Kuomintang troops would not attack China’s mainland.    The president said that negotiations with Communist China could include the issue of the American Air Force pilots detained in China.    He said that Dulles’[3] statement yesterday was approved by him before hand, and that the communiqué of the State Department in reply to Zhou Enlai’s proposal was not inclusive. He added that the wording of the communiqué might exceed the original meaning of the author, or the communiqué might have a mistake in wording.    The president said that in his opinion the “change” of American policy on Communist China was rather ostensible than realistic.     He also said that the army of Kuomintang China was only a defensive force.Britain wishes to be a loyal mediator between New China and the USA    According to the AFP news from London, the Defense Secretary Macmillan disclosed on April 27 that Britain was actively preparing to act as “a loyal mediator” between the USA and Communist China to end the dangerous Taiwan crisis.     Macmillan told the House of Commons that Britain had asked Premier Zhou Enlai to directly explain his proposal on negotiations with the USA and that Britain would take action before Zhou Enlai returned to Peking, which was apparent evidence that Britain had started the delicate work for reconciliation between the two countries. In doing so, Britain doubtlessly was thinking of next month’s election, i.e. the trump card of the Tory party was to describe Prime Minister Eden[4] as “a peace and reconciled man”     Therefore, Macmillan could tell the House of Commons that “our effort in the Taiwan affairs was not fruitless”.     From then on, the British diplomat in Peking had been seeking a peaceful solution.    Another reason for Britain to concern the end of the Taiwan crisis was that it feared that the conflict between China and the USA would harm Hong Kong, and that normalization between China and the USA would remove the embargo on strategic goods, which was in the interest of Hong Kong. Nehru, Nasir and others speak to correspondents in Calcutta     According to the AFP news from Calcutta, Nehru said on April 27 that Premier Zhou Enlai made “a good and fair proposal” in the Bandung Conference that China was willing to discuss the Taiwan issue with the USA, and that Zhou Enlai had opened up “a broad road for other countries to explore”.     Nasir told correspondents that he believed that Zhou Enlai’s proposal was “reasonable”, and that he was moved by Zhou Enlai’s personality. He went on that he even changed his view on him, but not on Communism. He also said that “the Chinese premier is a person who gets on well with others and sincerely desires to cooperate with others”.Menzies’s comments on Zhou Enlai’s proposal      According to Reuter’s news from Canberra, the Australian Prime Minister Menzies mentioned the proposal on the negotiations between China and the USA at a press conference on April 24, saying that “it’s natural that people always have reservation on these peace proposals consistently put forward”.     Menzies also said that “the Asian and African people’s strong anti-communist opinion appeared in last week’s discussion” at the Asian-African Conference, which, “so far as we know, might cause Communist China to put forward a moderate proposal”.Reactions of the diplomats in Washington to the peace negotiations on Taiwan      According to the UPI news from Washington, the British Foreign Secretary Macmillan had instructed its Charge d’Affaires in Peking, William Du, to get the details of Zhou Enlai’s peace proposal. Sources from diplomatic circles said that Macmillan maintained that Dulles’ reconciled attitude towards Communist China should be immediately followed by Britain’s mediation in Peking. The British Charge d’Affaires Scott immediately met Dulles after his speech so as to confirm Dulles’ attitude. It was said that the Australian Prime Minister Menzies was also making efforts to consolidate the method through diplomatic channels for other countries taking responsibility for Taiwan, which was discussed between him and Dulles in his recent visit to the USA. It probably included some guarantees on Taiwan by Britain, Australia, New Zealand and other countries after the difficult question of Mazu and Jinmen islands was settled. But the guarantees would not be made before the general election at the end of May. The Australian ambassador would discuss the recent development in the Taiwan region with Dulles this afternoon. Some diplomats felt that the relations between Zhou Enlai and Nehru were not very good after the Asian-African Conference because Nehru failed to inform Zhou Enlai of his frank speech about Communism beforehand and the reconciled atmosphere Nehru had expected didn’t appear in the conference. They also said that the Pakistani prime minister sent Dulles a private letter, requesting to try every means to seek for the possibility of negotiations, which had given a good impression on the Pakistani high-ranking officials and received a warm welcome in London and the other capitals of the Commonwealth countries. Bright prospect (New Times of Burma on April 28, 1955) Dulles told correspondents in Washington that it wasn’t impossible to sit down to talk the Taiwan issue with the Chinese Communist Party, which primarily demonstrates the change of American policy on Communist China. Dulles’ statement has produced a realistic and well-received tone in Asia after a few days when Mr. Zhou Enlai announced his peace proposal. All peace-loving people and mediators should immediately seize this opportunity to solve the problems through negotiations. Both sides of the Taiwan dispute-China and the USA-seem to be making cautious concessions, but the USA is somewhat slow in action. China has almost entirely given up its former stand, i.e. the Taiwan issue was the invasion of Chinese territory by the USA. Dulles’s recent view and the American primary reaction to Zhou Enlai’s proposal contradict each other. Although Dulles still maintained that the negotiations with the Communist Party were not the recognition of the Peking regime, the USA is aggressively making actual concessions so that now somebody should take the initiative to break the ice between the two countries. Dulles himself admitted that the interrogative sentence of “then whose turn?” (It might refer to whose turn to make concession) should be regarded as a guideline and all rigid formulas should be cast aside in front of the existing threat of war. The earnest observers must always keep in mind that the Taiwan situation is still in danger despite of all achievements of the Bandung Conference. The time is ripe for a third party to control it and arrange the representatives of the USA and Communist China to hold the initial direct meeting. It is doubtless that many barriers must be removed if the meeting is held between the high-leveled leaders of two countries, but it’s imperative to immediately find a neutral place to start the preliminary work. Since U Nu is undoubtedly respected by the leaders of both sides, Burma now can offer its service in this regard. The questions raised by the American correspondents at the Dulles press conference represented the thought of the American people. Despite the big gap in their stands, they agreed to talk at least, i.e. the opportunity for negotiations between China and the USA exists at the present time. Even as Dulles has correctly insisted that the negotiations between China and the USA must start from the truce in the Taiwan Straits, it could also be hoped that this would not be an unacceptable condition for China. Once both sides sit down together, the thing will be a half success and effort for negotiations on the permanent solution to the Taiwan position will naturally start. Although the USA openly wanted to negotiate with China, it didn’t want to start the negotiations with the absence of Kuomintang. This is not a too big barrier, as in all disputes the two parties rarely wish to see each other, unless the dispute doesn’t exist at all. The USA will probably be persuaded by its friends, such as Pakistan and other countries, that it shouldn’t lay too much stress on the participation of Kuomintang in the negotiations. The wrongness of the American policy must be taken into consideration, which will be pointed out at the meeting between Burma and Kuomintang in Bangkok. The plan put forward by the Ceylonese prime minister on the solution to the Taiwan issue by trusteeship and referendum will be brought forth later. It is said that Kotalawela’s plan is not well-received by the relating parties. This should not discourage the study of the plan, as people will never be content with reconciliations or concessions. Regarding this plan, the USA and Kuomintang don’t like it, nor does the Communist Party of China. But we must face the reality, unless there is no way out but war. It is almost impossible to ask the USA and Kuomintang to surrender, just as it is to ask the Communist Party to give up all its demands on Taiwan. It seems that the only way is to let the people of Taiwan solve the issue themselves after a period of neutral trusteeship.The United States and Red China    By the Burmese Ahlin on April 28, 1955Premier Zhou Enlai declared at the Bandung Conference that China was willing to hold direct negotiations with the United States in order to relax the tension in the Taiwan region. With regard to Premier Zhou’s proposal, Pakistani Prime Minster Mohammed Ali informed the US Secretary of State Dulles that Premier Zhou was really sincere.Secretary of State Dulles reportedly expressed satisfaction at the talks to be held with the People’s Republic of China, for which we are also feeling delighted. Meanwhile we are even more excited that there are indications that Dulles has agreed with Zhou’s proposal that China is “willing to hold direct negotiations with the United States on a truce around the Taiwan Straits without the participation of Kuomintang representatives”. We must recognize those efforts made by the participating countries of the Bandung Conference, especially the 5 Colombo Conference states, in the promotion of negotiations on the Taiwan issue between the USA and Red China. Those who have promoted mutual understandings between them should also be recognized. We hope to make continuous efforts to realize the talks between the USA and Red China.The Secretary of State said that although he agreed to hold talks with Red China, he has to study certain phrases in Zhou’s proposal. Zhou’s sentence was that “Red China would never give up its right to liberate Taiwan”. This sentence is absolutely clear.  Zhou Enlai means that China must liberate Taiwan from the big power’s control.So there is no need to study this sentence of Zhou’s at all. If Zhou should liberate Taiwan by force, we would not agree, nor do the Colombo states. We hope Dulles will remain cool-headed on this issue in order to make efforts in realizing negotiations with Red China. This is a question of relaxing tension in the Taiwan region. Therefore, it can be solved by face-to-face talks alone between the two big powers. As far as the truce is concerned, in our opinion, it will come true naturally, provided the two parties agree to talk.Besides, all other related outstanding problems can be solved altogether as long as Red China and the USA agree to negotiate the Taiwan issue. For instance, the Chinese government could release the arrested American pilots before long. In fact, the USA did not put forward such a precondition that it hold talks with Red China only after the latter should release its pilots. For this reason, the broad mind of America merits attention, too.Secondly, the Kuomintang side totally disagrees to the direct talks between the USA and Red China. But the USA and the Kuomintang are allies so that it is believed that the latter could understand the former’s attitude. At present, the Kuomintang is in a very important position on the Taiwan issue, so the American attitude in showing respect to Kuomintang should deserve no criticism.In short, Premier Zhou Enlai has made an unexpected compromise, as the five Colombo states desired, for the sake of relaxing the tension in the Taiwan Straits. Therefore, we are confident that all of us will support and promote talks between the USA and Red China. The British side has also expressed its interest in and satisfaction on this event, for which we sincerely hope that the negotiations could become a reality. . The Five States of the Colombo Conference and the USA.    The Rangoon on April 29, 1955Although the Taiwan issue, the powder magazine in Asia, saw the hope of a solution at the Bandung Conference, the door to negotiations seems to be closed due to rejection by the USA. According to what the Ceylonese prime minister said, the proposal on negotiations on the Taiwan issue was put forward by the premier of Red China after his consultation with the five Colombo states. In view of this fact, the rejection of the proposal by the USA is tantamount to no importance paid by the USA towards the five Colombo states.Efforts were made by the five Colombo states for the peace of Taiwan and Red China has accepted the proposal made by the five Colombo states, but the USA rejected it, over which the five Colombo states should ponder seriously and look into accordingly.     Regarding this issue, the five Colombo states, receivers of the American military and economic aid, had better discontinue receiving this aid as the first step. If no action is taken, the USA will continue to pay no importance to the opinion of the world and no importance to the opinion of the five Colombo states. If the five Colombo states tolerate the attitude of the USA, then they will endlessly suffer from “being ridden on their own heads” by the USA.    USA and Red ChinaEditorial of Hanshwadi on April 28, 1955We are extremely happy at the proposal produced through outside contact at the Bandung Conference on the negotiations between the USA and Red China, and in addition we are more gratified at hearing the news that Prime Minister U Nu has expressed his willingness for mediation at any time. We are sure that there is no need to make more of an explanation of the reason for our gratification, as the Far Eastern Taiwan issue is the fiercest one among all international issues. Among the independent neutralist countries in the Far East, no other country is more suitable than Burma to be a mediator in terms of economy, politics, religion, culture and diplomatic relations. Secondly, in the atomic weapon era, in case the flames of world war were caused by the Taiwan issue, the sufferers would not only be the belligerent countries, but also their vassal countries, and other neutral countries would be affected as well. So, in order to prevent such a disaster, who will not welcome the negotiations? We regret to hear some people say that “although Red China has put forward the proposal on negotiations and Prime Minister U Nu has expressed his willingness to mediate, the American side has not yet made a clear reply; meanwhile whether the negotiations shall come true or not is still in doubt as the American side once expressed that Chiang Kai-shek must participate in the negotiations, and also the past negotiations on the Korean issue ended without results”.We regret even more that some people went so far as to list various reasons to criticize the negotiations and claimed that in any case they wouldn’t be realized.In short, our opinion is that the situation will get worse if negotiations are not conducted, and there is nothing to lose if negotiations are held.  As the saying goes, “hope sometimes may turn into a disappointment, but sometimes hopelessness turns into hope”, so that we should not lose hope when our just endeavors are made for the interests of the world’s people.  We believe that we should not only support and render a helping hand to the endeavors, but also pray for the success of the endeavors. The Asian-African ConferenceKotalawela’s Comments on the Asian-African ConferenceAccording to the Reuter’s news report from Colombo on April 27, the Ceylonese Daily News carried an interview by its correspondent with the Ceylonese prime minister on the result of the Asian-African Conference. The Ceylonese prime minister said that Mr. Zhou Enlai was not so bad as other people had said, and that “I hope he is really as good as he looks”. In answering the question of what’s the attitude of Ceylon towards the alliance since the declaration of the conference had approved regional alliances, he said that various countries in the past were afraid of joining alliances, but “now it is about  how to get assistance from our friends in order to cope with the situation just in case. This principle has been accepted by the Bandung Conference, that is to say, to join alliances for defense will not be misunderstood and those who do so will not be called puppets accordingly. Take Ceylon as an example: we need assistance from our friends when we are in difficulty. And Britain is our best friend”.Kotalawela said that some people had said that he attempted to undermine the Bandung Conference, but he said that must be spread by the sympathizers of the Communist Party. He said that “the question of Soviet colonialism I put forward was not to undermine the conference, but made the conference more vigorous”. The Ceylonese prime minister added that Ceylon would take a wait-and-see policy before the establishment of diplomatic relations with China.Comments of the prime ministers of India, Pakistan and Egypt on the Asian-African Conference   According to AFP’s news report from Calcutta on April 27, the Pakistani prime minister pointed out that after the Bandung Conference, the 10-point communiqué included all the 7 items put forward by Pakistan. He added that some items of the Five Principles formulated by India and Communist China were not included in the Bandung Conference Communiqué.  Nehru said that because some items of the Five Principles were not included in the Bandung Conference Communiqué didn’t mean that he had given up “any moral principles”. He went on that he would completely abide by the Bandung Conference Communiqué, but this would not prevent him from making further efforts to improve it as long as he kept in conformity with the communiqué. He also said that “the Bandung Conference is in favor of everybody, it is not only in favor of the participating countries, but also the bystander countries”.Nasir said that in his opinion the 10-point conference communiqué “has no difference in terms of content” with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. He went on that the 10 points of the conference were “the improvement of the Five Principles”. He added that any defense system should be initiated by the people of the region. He also said that “the Middle East defense can only come from the people of the Middle East”, and insisted that “the participation of the western countries in the Middle East defense shall be explained as colonialism”.Nehru, at the side of Nasir, said to the correspondents that in his opinion the majority people of any country should have the utmost right to run the affairs of the country, and in Africa the majority people were Africans. He went on that India wouldn’t ask for any privileges, and that the racial discrimination was enforced by the South African authorities, not the Indian people. He added that although many participating countries of the Bandung Conference had no diplomatic relations, they reached a common agreement, which “has set a good example for those countries which have never held any meetings, nor have they reached any agreements”.  Allen’s comments on the Asian-African ConferenceAccording to a Reuters’s news report from Washington on April 27, the Assistant Secretary of State Allen yesterday said that the Asian-African Conference was “a good and useful conference”. He said at a luncheon in honor of the Asian City Administration Delegation that despite the severe criticism of the USA by the conference, the criticism was welcome as a method of drawing forth truth.  Imperialists are cowardsThe People on April 28During the Asian-African Conference, all newspapers in London were not published except for the Workers Daily as the printing workers in London were striking in order to increase their wages. Regarding the news and comments on the Asian-African Conference, the newspapers other than those in London, such as the Guardian in Manchester, carried a few. Some newspapers published in Britain commented that “the Bandung Conference couldn’t make any important solutions due to the fact that the allies of imperialism are participating in the Asian-African Conference and they would undermine the conference, therefore, no agreement could be reached by the conference……”The newspapers published in New York and Washington also unblushingly commented on the Asian-African Conference, as that Mr. so-and-so and others, the participants of the conference, were their friends so that they believed that the conference couldn’t score any achievements.But after the opening of the conference, 655 journalists went to Bandung to cover it and the news they sent by telegrams amounted to 280,000 words per day, which had proved how public opinion of the world was interested in the Bandung Conference. Since the opening of the conference, it had been going on steadily. The people of the world and the “masters” had seen from the conference how capable the saboteurs were. At last, the henchmen took some action in the rage of their “masters” and the conference had come to a successful close. Yesterday, the broadcasting station of the British government broadcasted a comment on the Bandung Conference. The comment itself fully exposed how distressed the imperialists felt regarding the achievements of the Bandung Conference.The imperialist’s comments originally said that the Bandung Conference couldn’t score any achievements, but one week later they changed their tone. The London Broadcasting Station said that “although an ordinary people can’t see the resolution of the conference or whether the conference will succeed or not, a man with political foresight may see clearly that the achievement scored by the Communist Party of China in the Bandung Conference is immeasurable”.The commentator of the London Broadcasting Station commented that “it is very dreadful that the premier of the New China has invited Prince Wong of the Thailand to dispatch an inspecting group to China at anytime to see whether China has concentrated its troops along the Sino-Thai border for attacking Thailand”.The commentator commented that “the New China has also invited the Philippine Minister Lomoro to send a government delegation to the southeast coastal area of China to inspect whether China is preparing for war, which is very dangerous to imperialists”.The Bandung Conference has made the participating countries feel that “we may get united and are not enemies of each other, so that the Bandung Conference is not important to the ordinary people, but very important to politicians.The participating countries believe that the proposal put forward by the New China on negotiations with the USA is sincere, therefore the Chinese representative has scored a tremendous achievement in the conference……”The London Broadcasting Station is just like a merchant who “is very jealous of seeing others make a fortune”. Therefore, the misfortune of imperialism this time is really “pitiful”.When Dulles and Eden went to the Southeast Asia to sign the Southeast Asia Defense Treaty, they both unblushingly said that “the Southeast Asia Treaty is not for invasion, but purely for defense”. Now, when Mr. Zhou Enlai announces that China had no intention to invade others and prepared to invite the five countries of Burma, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and the Philippines to dispatch their inspection groups to the Chinese border areas to inspect, the “masters” who endeavored to knock together the Southeast Asian “defense” will really feel that all their previous efforts were wasted and sigh in vain. Despite the distress of the imperialists, the essence is nothing but a failure of their illegal activity. The imperialists once attempted to use the Chiang Kai-shek “government” to replace the true government of the Chinese people, which represents 600 million people, one fourth of the world populations. Now the 28 participating countries of the Bandung Conference have known that the Chiang Kai-shek “government” is not the government of the Chinese people and that the government of the New China represented by Zhou Enlai pursues a peace policy. It’s nothing but this achievement that has deeply distressed the imperialists. A cold war prepared and engineered by imperialists was uprooted in the Bandung Conference.Perhaps, the imperialists would suspect and take it out on their vassal countries because of the failure, blaming them for disloyalty or good-for-nothing.But the imperialist vassal countries failed and put up their hands to surrender.Just cause is bound to win.The Bandung ConferenceThe Times of Burma on April 28We still don’t know the particulars and the resolutions of the conference as the report on the Bandung Conference has not been published. The newspapers only reported some fragmentary news about the conference. The important one is the report signed by the 29 countries. One point may be inferred from the fragmentary news, that the purpose of the conference has not been fully brought about. In other words, the Bandung Conference has not scored the achievement it expected. It’s not strange that the conference has not succeeded, as the Asian-African countries have never met each other before, don’t know each other and have different views so that it’s impossible for them to unite together. But why isn’t the conference an achievement if we view it positively?It is said that the conference discussed issues on world peace, the Five Principles, ban on use of atomic weapons, opposition to racial discrimination, etc. All are old issues, not new. But the characteristics of the conference are that the Communist Party is also a form of colonialism and the People’s Government of China put forward a proposal on the negotiations with the USA. In the past, the mention of colonialism usually indicates Britain and the USA. In the Bandung Conference, the representatives of Ceylon and the Philippines raised the concept that the Communist Party was colonialism, which caused defense by the Chinese representative. This is one of the characteristics of the conference. In the past, the Red China shouted without end, but now it put forward a proposal on negotiations with the USA, which may be said to be the first concession made by China. This is the second characteristic. It seems that Zhou Enlai is sincere in putting forward this proposal. But the once frightened USA dares not to accept Zhou Enlai’s proposal promptly, demanding that Red China show its sincerity by actual behavior. What reaction Zhou Enlai’s proposal will cause is still unknown.The Bandung Conference is closed. What influence will the conference produce on the change of the international situation? Will the resolutions adopted by the conference be respected by the big powers? Do the big powers consider the Bandung Conference a children’s party? Was there a demand for unity or quarrel causing a breakdown in the conference? A number of these questions can not be answered at present time. These questions can only be answered when the jointly signed report is published and the reactions of the big powers are made public.    [1] John Kotalawela was Prime Minister of Ceylon (Sri Lanka) from 1953 to 1956.

      "On 23-30 March 1976, Moges Wolde-Michael, the chairman of the Economic Committee of the Ethiopian Provisional Military Administrative Council, paid a friendly visit to the DPRK as the head of a government delegation. During the rule of Emperor Haile Selassie, there had not been diplomatic relations between [the two countries], as Ethiopia was one of the 16 states which sent so-called UN troops to the Korean War on the side of the Americans and the South Koreans. A substantial change could occur only after that in 1974—as Moges Wolde-Michael put it—the Ethiopian people overthrew the rule of the feudal-bourgeois [circles]. Diplomatic relations were established in June 1975.The fraternal government delegation of the socialist Ethiopia was given special attention. Although the negotiating partner of Moges Wolde-Michael was Deputy Premier Jeong Jun-gi, Vice-President Kang Ryang-uk also attended the receptions. On March  26, head of state Kim Il Sung received the Ethiopian government delegation, and gave a lunch to their honor.According to the information received from the Foreign Ministry, the Ethiopian government delegation visited the DPRK in order to inform [the North Koreans] about the progress of the Ethiopian revolution, and to ask the DPRK for economic aid. During the negotiations and programs, and in the speeches they made at a mass meeting, they emphasized the significance of the two countries’ anti-imperialist struggle and of their membership in the Non-Aligned Movement. On one occasion, Moges Wolde-Michael declared that “The DPRK and Ethiopia fight on the same front against imperialism, colonialism, and Zionism.” The Ethiopian government delegation expressed its support to the struggle of the Korean people. Ethiopia supports the struggle for the unification of Korea, and the aforesaid visit “created a firm and eternal basis for the friendly relations and cooperation between the two countries.”In his public speeches, Moges Wolde-Michael generously lavished the kind of praise that is welcomed in Pyongyang. He praised the juche idea that had enabled the DPRK to perform miracles, “which is attributable to the genial guidance of President Kim Il Sung, the great and excellent leader, and to the diligent work of the Korean people.” He declared that the example of Korea was worth following, and stated that “The political independence and economic self-reliance, which is resolutely defended by the Korean people, is an excellent model for the socialist Ethiopian people.”According to the information we received in the Foreign Ministry, during the confidential talks Moges Wolde-Michael frequently reiterated that the old Ethiopia had committed an indelible crime when it participated in the war against the Korean people. The head of the government delegation emphasized that this had been a crime of the old leadership, for the new government pursued a policy of friendship with the Korean people. The other main objective of the Ethiopian delegation was to conclude agreements in the field of economic cooperation, and to obtain credit for Ethiopia from the DPRK. Choe Un-ryong, a deputy departmental head of the 1st Main Department of the FM [Foreign Ministry] who provided us with information about this issue in response of our request, said that the Ethiopian delegation handed over a thick volume [that contained the list of their requests]. They ask for the DPRK’s assistance to the creation of the new [socialist] villages in Ethiopia, and to the construction of power stations and a wide range of industrial plants.  The DPRK was surprised by this request for such an immense amount of aid. They did not expect such a bulky list of requests. Jeong Jun-gi merely told the Ethiopian delegation that the DPRK would examine the requests, and it would restart talks about those ones whose fulfillment it considered possible.The delegation headed by Moges Wolde-Michael also included a military delegate, but the Ethiopian delegation made no request of a military nature to the DPRK. This is in contradiction with the news which have spread within the diplomatic corps in Pyongyang.Ferenc Szabóambassador\n",

      "TELEGRAM 016.723To: the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Third Directorate)From: the Romanian Embassy in BanguiSubject: relations between the Central African Empire and the two Korean statesDate: August 1st, 1978 Classification: SecretBy establishing diplomatic relations with the two Korean states, the Central African Empire has aimed from the very beginning to play them off one another so that each of them contributes as much as possible with economic and technical assistance, as well as non-reimbursable aid.Emperor Bokassa’s visit to the DPRK which ended with the signing of 12 agreements and conventions for the construction of [various] economic facilities on loan [from North Korea], was followed by some visit exchanges, at ministerial level.On the occasion of the recent visit of the DPRK Finance Minister the following plans were finalized: the construction of the new palace in Berengo, the irrigation of a 5000-ha area; the construction of a soap factory and a furniture factory.In response, the Seoul regime took action to invigorate its relationship with the Central African Empire. In this respect, it sent its ambassador to Washington as special envoy of the South Korean president; as Emperor Bokassa was away, the South Korean special envoy was received by the Central African Prime Minister. The [South Korean] special envoy relayed an invitation for Emperor Bokassa to visit South Korea, [which would allow] the two countries to discuss the possibilities for developing their political and economic relations. North Korean diplomats are closely following the actions of the Seoul regime and they admit that Emperor Bokassa managed to draw them into a competition [for the Central African Empire]. The DPRK believes that in the future evolution of its relations with the Central African Empire there will be favorable conditions for the DPRK to determine the Central African Empire to break off diplomatic relations with South Korea.Our embassy [estimates] that this goal of the DPRK cannot be achieved, knowing the ability of Emperor Bokassa and the fact that the two countries are members of the UN. At the same time, we believe there are no serious reasons to determine the Central African Empire to take such a radical political decision.Written by M. GeorgescuSignedAmbassador N. Tăbîrcă \n",

      "Foreign Ministry Top Secret DocumentRecord of Premier Zhou Enlai Meeting with Pak Se-chang, DPRK Ambassador to China(Premier has yet to review)Time: 4 p.m., 6 August 1964Place: Xihua Hall, ZhongnanhaiPersons attending the meeting: Yao Guang, Director, 2nd Asian Affairs Department; Ge Buhai, Deputy Director, Protocol DepartmentTranslator: Li XiangwenRecorder： Tao BingweiPak: Comrade Premier, I am really grateful that you found time in your busy schedule today to see me.Zhou: We are fraternal countries , so I should do so. Comrade Ambassador, you must understand the situation in Vietnam.Pak: I do.Yao: This morning, I handed over the government statement to Comrade Ambassador.Zhou: There flew over 60 sorties, with bombing and strafing for four of them. Five aircraft were shot down, and another three were damaged. One airman was captured. Even the United States has admitted the shoot-down of two aircraft. The other three aircraft possibly fell into the sea, or they could have been recovered from the water. From 12:30 to 4:30, for four hours, coastal bases were bombed. Our side’s losses were not great. The US side mainly used old propeller aircraft, as well as a small number of old jet aircraft. At present the United States has a plan, which is to throw onto the front line things soon to be scrapped and write them off. This can be seen in Vietnam.After the bombing, US Defense Secretary McNamara said that the retaliatory actions had ended and that subsequent actions would depend on Vietnam’s actions. This action is an outright fabrication of the US side. There was no dispatch of forces on the Vietnamese side. The People's Daily has already reported this in detail.On 2 August there was a first dispatch of military forces; the Vietnamese took action in self-defense. The opposite side suffered no injury; the Vietnamese side had damage to one ship. The second one, in contrast, was entirely planned beforehand by the US side. At that time there were no Vietnamese ships there.The Workers Party of Vietnam held a meeting, appraised the situation, and notified us today. They recognize that this action is a first probing attack, including an overall plan of action of maximum deployment to Vietnam and Laos.The goals of this first US probe are: 1) to save itself from defeat in South Vietnam, engaging in a retaliation to confuse and poison the public’s mind; 2) to probe its allies (including dependent countries) for their reactions; 3) to probe Vietnam for its power to resist; 4) to probe relations between China and Vietnam for China’s reaction; and 5) to probe the socialist camp for its reaction. In addition there is another, which is to obtain electoral advantage. This last goal has been achieved. Johnson has used this, conducting bipartisan talks and obtaining Goldwater’s agreement.On the other hand, it has been a major exposure, proving the failure of the United States.Does this boost South Vietnam’s morale? It is complete bunk. If the United States were to stop for a day, it could make South Vietnam lose hope all the more.In Laos, they cannot firm up the situation inside the country. Moreover a faction in Laos caused an uproar. Phoumi Nosavan, the top military official was arrested and could have been put under house arrest. Phouma went to Luang Prabang. In short, contradictions on the right have already surfaced.Even Chiang Kai-shek’s gang, which most hopes to expand the war, believes that the US attack against North Vietnam cannot continue.Is the United States probing the reaction of allied countries? The majority of them oppose it, with only Britain completely following along. France opposes it. Nor does Japan, wishing for a peaceful resolution, approve of it. West German for its part says that this issue has nothing to do with it. Thailand, although expressing support, is not so positive. Even India expresses regret.Naturally, Asia, Africa, and Latin America, as well as public opinion around the world, are opposed. Cambodia, Pakistan, and Ghana have all spoken on it. Japan’s leftists are also opposed. The current of opposition is likely to continue developing. I believe that the US fabrication and plotting are likely to be further exposed and come under the attack of the whole world.As for probing Vietnam’s strength, the fact is quite clear. Vietnam has resisted very well this time, having downed US aircraft while suffering few losses on its side.What about probing China? We have said it. We certainly must give support. We cannot sit and observe without going to the rescue. Today’s newspapers all reflected this attitude.I believe that the socialist camp and other leftist countries absolutely will respond one after the next.In the leading revisionist state, the Soviet news agency TASS has already issued a statement. But even the West believes that this statement is moderate. In fact, the Soviet Union is now engaged in double-dealing, having already agreed to take this issue to the United Nations for resolution.The issue of Indochina should not be discussed by the United Nations. Even Sihanouk opposes discussion by the United Nations.The Soviet Union in the Security Council supports the US proposal and speaks of wishing to invite the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) representative to join the discussion. This issue lies, at root, within the bounds of the Vienna Conference. By no means does it belong in the United Nations. The DRV of course holds firm in opposing this UN discussion. For the past several days such telegrams have arrived.The Soviet Union’s proposal is fundamentally unreasonable, completely acknowledging the US accusation. The United States has turned into the plaintiff; Vietnam, on the contrary, has become the defendant. This, once again, is an exposure. In reality, this is an attempt of two countries -- the United States and Soviet Union-- to settle the issue.According to the estimates of our Vietnamese comrades, as seen at present, following this action there is likely to be a halt for a time. Nor does it appear that the United States will soon expand the war into North Vietnam. The United States is proceeding step by step, in line with the election in that country. At times, however, the United States is also capable of taking risks. Because of this, we do not rule out the possibility of the United States conducting provocations.Vietnamese comrades are now actively making preparations. We, too, are now actively making preparations and increasing our vigilance.At present, such is the situation in Vietnam. I was going to have the Foreign Ministry inform Comrade Ambassador, but today Comrade Ambassador has come and I have used this opportunity to discuss matters. Comrade Ambassador, please communicate this to Premier Kim and the Korean Party Center.Pak: I will report right away. Today, in coming to meet Comrade Premier, I first convey the personal and entire concern of our Party Center and Cabinet for Comrade Premier and gratitude for arranging in detail the matter of Premier Kim’s visit to Indonesia. Premier Kim instructed me to express our thanks directly to Premier Zhou. At present, the situation in Vietnam is tense. Our Party Center and Cabinet are highly worried for the safety of our Premier while he is on his visit overseas. Moreover, as our leader has never visited a capitalist country, I have been particularly instructed to hear the considerations and views of Comrade Premier.Zhou: I heard that you and Vice Minister Zeng Yongquan discussed the situation yesterday. I have been giving this matter my attention. Today, having researched the situation and materials in their entirety, my sense is that US action probably will pause for a time. Of course, one cannot say that the United States will not act again. But in this the United States is likely to go through a period of observation. Last night we made two types of estimate. One is a pause, and one is a continuation for two or three days. This morning, having studied various materials, I judged the situation to be of the first type.The United States is taking this issue to the Security Council. We, of course, oppose this. But from an international point of view, this will simmer down. As the United States has already proposed this, in doing so again they must find an excuse and must really be occupied with the matter, as the old fabrications no longer work. On my previous trip to Pyongyang, I talked about this issue. The United States in the Security Council, having put forth a proposal, will also require a political solution.We, too, endorse a political resolution, but we must convene the Geneva Conference. Only in convening the Geneva Conference can we resolve the issue. One can estimate that following the election, with the United States in South Vietnam and Lao having come to grief, the United States only then is likely to agree to hold such a conference. At present the United States has yet to resign itself to the situation.So, as for Vietnam, there is likely to be a period of calm. But we must make active preparations while giving the enemy no pretext. If the enemy should engage in provocation, only then will we counterattack within the bounds of self-defense. The Vietnamese side, too, is preparing to act in this way. As for the situation in all of Southeast Asia, tension is unlikely to grow some eight, nine or 13 months before elections in the United States.From this estimate of the situation, Premier Kim's trip abroad is formally guaranteed. Of course, we cannot be careless but must increase our vigilance. We are researching and preparing in detail the organization work, every step of it, to ensure no problem should emerge in the flight. In the event of any difficulty, one side can contact the other at any time. We also have a vice minister responsible for this matter, and the embassy is indeed in daily contact with the Foreign Ministry. And I daily check on the situation and can inform you at any time through the Foreign Ministry. Before departure, should we encounter hindrance coming from imperialism and its vassal countries, we will inform you as necessary, and at that time still have time to change the itineraryIf en route there arise any difficulties, we can consider the following: either do not go or take a detour by an aircraft of Pakistan. It is legal for Pakistan’s aircraft to fly on international routes. Pakistan these days is better for us than imperialism. Comrade Ambassador, are you in contact with Pakistan’s ambassador to China?Pak: No.Zhou: The Foreign Ministry can make an introduction, and you can talk with him.Our aircraft have flown before to Indonesia without incident. The leg of the flight from Beijing to Rangoon is no problem, as Burma has a relatively good attitude toward us. So, the problem is from Rangoon to Jakarta, having between those two points to fly along the coast of Thailand and Malaya. Although flying in international waters, we have notified them in the past and it was still fine. If this time there should emerge any problem here, we can consider not going or changing our route. From Guangzhou or Shanghai we could fly one of Pakistan’s Boeing aircraft for a direct flight to Dhaka, then fly in international waters to Jakarta。Boeing aircraft, made in the United States, are faster than the Ilyushin IL-18. We have flown in them; they are very safe. From Guangzhou to Dhaka takes at most three hours, it is another three hours from Dhaka to Jakarta. This is just a thought, as the route from Rangoon to Jakarta is not necessarily a problem. However, we have made preparations and are now making arrangements.As for the issue of security following arrival in Jakarta, Ambassador Yao Zhongming has already returned and arranged matters. He is in contact with the DPRK ambassador to Indonesia and Comrade Aidit. Together with Indonesia, our embassy and overseas Chinese will make every effort to protect Premier Kim. We believe that Comrade Aidit will actively help. They were a great help last time when President Liu and Comrade Chen Yi went.Please, Comrade Ambassador, give your Center the following three situation reports:(1)    Judging from the political situation, we feel that this foreign visit will not be obstructed.(2)    Each day I intend to pay attention, take note, and take part in all issues related to this foreign visit. We must all be involved in this, from the Premier’s departure until his return. In the event a problem should occur, we can consider the two previous approaches discussed. One would be not to go; another would be to fly instead to Pakistan for a detour.(3) For security in Indonesia, the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI), our embassy and overseas Chinese will do their utmost to protect Premier Kim. Sukarno has invited the Premier, and he must also take responsibility to guard him. While in Indonesia, if the situation is good, Premier Kim go out and look around. If the situation is not good, then for the reason of ill health, he can hold many discussions, take many breaks, and spend little time touring the regions. In this way, his security will be more assured.Our thinking is only for reference. Everything still requires hearing from Korea’s Party Center and Premier Kim’s decision.Pak: Once again, Comrade Premier, I thank you for finding the time, busy as you are, to meet me. I will report today to Pyongyang everything concerning the situation reports that Comrade Premier has discussed.Copies: Politburo Standing Committee; Each Comrade of the Secretariat; Chen Yi; He Long; Rongzhen; Boda; Confidential Affairs Bureau; General Office, CPC Central CommitteeOffice of Foreign Affairs (1); Central Propaganda Department (1); International Liaison Department (3); Investigation Department (1); Military Intelligence (1); Third Department (1)Ministry of National Defense (3); Combat Operations Department; PLAAF Headquarters; Ministry of Public Security; MuzhiForeign Ministry leadership; General Office (3); Foreign Policy Research Office (2); 1st Asian Affairs Department; 2nd Asian Affairs Department; Ambassador; 3 file copies57 copies printed in totalReceived 7 August 1964       Sent to printer on 7 August 1964General Office, Foreign Ministry                   Printed and distributed on 7 August 1964\n",

      "Hereby I report the following information:On [August] 6, the chargé d’affaires of the DRV embassy paid me a visit. […]On my inquiry about the latest developments of Korean-Vietnamese relations, the chargé d’affaires stated that no new elements have been added to their relations. [Their relations] have remained unchanged, that is, they are good; [the two countries], at their discretion, mutually support each other’s struggle against aggressive American imperialism as far as they can. At the same time the chargé d’affaires drew my attention to the declaration that the DRV F[oreign] M[inistry] had made on July 20, on the 16th anniversary of the Geneva Agreements. According to the chargé d’affaires, this declaration well demonstrates the DRV standpoint on [the idea of] the common front of the “five Asian countries,” which has been recently so much emphasized by the Korean comrades. That is, the Vietnamese standpoint has remained unaltered, he said; since American imperialism is an enemy of every socialist country and of the entire mankind, not only of the “five countries,” it is necessary to achieve cooperation not only between the “five countries” but also between all anti-imperialist forces [emphasis in the original], and the main force of anti-imperialist struggle is not confined to the common front of a few countries but encompasses the whole socialist camp [emphasis in the original], for whose unity they, Vietnamese Communists, are fighting in the spirit of [1st President of Democratic Republic of Vietman] Comrade Ho Chi Minh’s last will. The chargé d’affaires asked how I evaluated the recent visit of a Korean military delegation in Beijing. I replied that I considered it [an event] whose importance was greater than that of a simple protocol or return visit. On his part, the chargé d’affaires added that in his view, [the visit] was a direct consequence of the Korean-Chinese joint communiqué that had been made in April […].                                                                                                                                     [Signature]\n",

      "TOP SECRETmb-04339/gs 9 August 1966copies to: Brezhnev (2), Kosygin (2), Gromyko, Kuznetsov, Kovalev, Kornienko, Sudarikov, IDU, UVI, OIuVA (2), file (2)On the Korean War, 1950-53, and the Armistice NegotiationsI. [Background to and Preparations for First Stage of the War]After separate elections in 1948 in South Korea and the formation of the puppet government of Rhee Syngman, on the one hand, and the formation of the DPRK, on the other, relations between the North and the South of the country were sharply aggravated. The Seoul regime, as well as the DPRK, declared its claim to be the authority in all of Korea. The situation at the 38th parallel became even more tense in 1948 after the withdrawal of Soviet and American troops from Korea. During this period, Kim Il Sung and other Korean leaders were firmly determined to unify the country by military means, without devoting the necessary attention to studying the possibility that existed at that time for peaceful reunification through the broad development of the democratic movement in South Korea. In the DPRK, a people’s army was created which in manpower and equipment significantly surpassed the armed forces of South Korea. By January 1, 1950, the total number of DPRK troops was 110,000; new divisions were hastily being formed.[1]Calculating that the USA would not enter a war over South Korea, Kim Il Sung persistently pressed for agreement from Stalin and Mao Zedong to reunify the country by military means. (telegrams #4-51, 233, 1950) Stalin at first treated the persistent appeals of Kim Il Sung with reserve, noting that “such a large affair in relation to South Korea ... needs much preparation,” but he did not object in principle. The final agreement to support the plans of the Koreans was given by Stalin at the time of Kim Il Sung’s visit to Moscow in March-April 1950. Following this, in May, Kim Il Sung visited Beijing and secured the support of Mao. The Korean government envisioned realizing its goal in three stages:1) concentration of troops near the 38th parallel2) issuing an appeal to the South for peaceful unification3) initiating military activity after the South’s rejection of the proposal for peaceful unification. At Stalin’s order, all requests of the North Koreans for delivery of arms and equipment for the formation of additional units of the KPA [Korean People’s Army] were quickly met. The Chinese leadership sent to Korea a division formed from Koreans who had been serving in the Chinese army, and promised to send food aid and to transfer one army closer to Korea “in case the Japanese enter on the side of South Korea.” (telegram 362, 1950)By the end of May 1950 the General Staff of the KPA together with Soviet military advisers announced the readiness of the Korean army to begin concentration at the 38th parallel. At the insistence of Kim Il Sung, the beginning of military activity was scheduled for June 25, 1950. (telegram 408, 1950) By the time of the attack, the North Korean armed forces had significant superiority over the South Koreans. The correlation of forces between South and North Korea was as follows: in number of troops 1:2; number of guns 1:2; machine- guns 1:7; submachine guns, 1:13; tanks 1:6.5; planes 1:6. The operational plan of the KPA envisioned that Korean troops would advance 15-20 kilometers per day and would in the main complete military activity within 22-27 days. (telegram 468, 1950)[Here follows a brief factual account of the course of the war through October 1950, from the initial successes of the KPA in June, July, and August, through their near defeat following the U.S./U.N. amphibious landing at Inchon in September- K.W.] During this period, which was an ordeal for the Korean people, the Central Committee of the Korean Worker’s Party and the government of the DPRK worked strenuously on the formation of new military units, using the territory of China as well for this purpose. The most steadfast of the KPA units that were surrounded in the South carried on partisan combat in the mountains II. Entry of the Chinese into the Korean WarDuring Kim Il Sung’s visit to Beijing in May 1950, Mao Zedong, in conversation with him, underscored his conviction that the Americans would not become engaged in a war “for such a small territory as Korea” and stated that the Chinese government would transfer one of their armies to the region of Mukden in order to render the necessary assistance in case the South Koreans drew Japanese soldiers into military action. The Chinese leadership based their calculation on the fact that the American troops would not take part in the war, and they did not intend to aid the DPRK by means of the entrance of a large number of their troops. In August 1950 American planes began bombing Chinese territory near the Yalu. In October 1950, soon after the American landing at Inchon, the front line moved close to the Korean- Chinese border and the enemy’s artillery began to fire on Chinese territory. Ships of the American Seventh Fleet entered the Taiwan Straits. By that time the Korean People’s Army had virtually disintegrated as a fighting force. Remnants of military units that escaped encirclement were making their way toward China to regroup.The Chinese government, under pressure from Stalin, adopted the decision to send volunteers to Korea only after a real threat to the security of China had arisen and the very existence of the DPRK had been called into question. The entry of Chinese volunteers into Korea began in the second half of October 1950. Subsequently, the total number of Chinese troops in Korea was brought to 1 million men; approximately the same number of men were sent to Korea to transport military cargo. (transmission of Soviet Embassy in Beijing #7, January 18, 1952) By the end of 1951, the strength of the Korean People’s Army was brought to 337,000 men. On the other side, 700,000 officers and soldiers participated in ground operations, including 380,000 South Koreans and 280,000 American troops, not counting American naval and air forces, which blockaded Korea from the sea. The entry of the Chinese volunteers into the war and the active participation of Soviet military advisers, who participated in the planning of all major offensive operations, brought about a vital breakthrough in the course of military events. American and South Korean troops were thrown back to the 38th parallel, and in several places even further southward. Chinese troops, operating on the Western front, occupied Seoul at the beginning of January 1951. However, Chinese troops, following the strategic line of the leadership of the PRC to preserve the front at the 38th parallel (one may suppose that Mao Zedong was afraid of the consequences of a further advance to the south), left Seoul and withdrew to the north. They did not support the efforts of the Korean units on the eastern front to dislodge American troops from the area along the northern side of the 38th parallel.During this period of the war, sharp disagreements arose between Kim Il Sung and the command of the Chinese people’s volunteers, led by Peng Dehuai. The Koreans were against the surrender of Seoul by the Chinese volunteers and reproached them for not supporting the Korean units on the eastern front.During the time that Chinese volunteers were in Korea there were numerous cases of Chinese interference in the internal affairs of the DPRK. Studying the morale of the Korean population, they sent reports to the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party which underscored the poor conditions of the population and criticized the policies of the Korean authorities. The Chinese attempted to draw towards themselves the commanders of the KPA. Illustrative in this regard is the affair of Pak Il-u, chief representative of the KPA in the headquarters of the Chinese volunteers. Kim Il Sung more than once declared that Pak Il-u was behaving as the personal representative of Mao Zedong, trying to disparage the authority of the leadership of the Korean Worker’s Party, placing himself above the party. The Chinese inflamed any sort of intrigue, using Pak Il-u against Kim Il Sung. Peng Dehuai was not ashamed to express his low opinion of the military capabilities of Kim Il Sung. Cases of great power manners were observed, obvious scorn toward Koreans by Chinese commanders. Once Kim Il Sung was stopped by Chinese sentries when he went to Peng Dehuai’s headquarters, and was detained by them for a long time. Local Korean authorities complained that the commanders of the Chinese volunteers frequently arbitrarily forced the population into construction work, indiscriminate felling of forests, slaughtering of livestock, etc.Numerous Koreans lay the blame on China for the retreat of the KPA and its huge losses, declaring that “if the Chinese help had arrived a month earlier, everything would have turned out differently.” Korean leaders said at that time that if it had not been for the Chinese position, it would have been possible to expel the Americans from the Korean peninsula and unify the whole country during the successful attack of the Chinese volunteers in the winter of 1950-51.In all of this the Chinese volunteers, as is known, played an important role in the breakthrough in the military situation and in the retention of the front at the 38th parallel. Their losses for the first year of the Korean War alone were more than 300,000 men. The Chinese leadership, making use of the volunteers’ long stay in Korea, tried to strengthen their long-term influence in the DPRK. After the signing of the armistice in Korea on July 27, 1953, the Chinese volunteers remained in Korea for more than five years. It was the end of October 1958 before they returned to their homeland, under pressure from the Koreans. The Chinese leaders even now, in every way possible, use the participation of the volunteers in the war in Korea to pressure the DPRK into supporting their adventuristic positions.III. The U.N. and the Intervention of the USA in Korea [a brief straightforward summary-K.W.] IV. Negotiations for the ArmisticeBy the middle of 1951, the situation clearly indicated that it was in practice impossible to resolve the unification of Korea by military means. Both the Chinese and the Korean leaders equally were forced to acknowledge this. After preliminary consultations with the Chinese and Koreans, the Soviet government on June 23, 1951, put forward a proposal for settling the military conflict in Korea. “As a first step,” the Soviet representative declared, “it would be necessary to begin negotiations for a cease-fire, for an armistice with a mutual withdrawal of troops from the 38th parallel.” This proposal attracted universal attention. On June 27, 1951, the American Ambassador [to Moscow Alan G.] Kirk visited A.A. Gromyko (at that time deputy minister of foreign affairs of the USSR) and appealed to him with a number of questions in connection with these proposals. Elucidating to Kirk the position of the Soviet government, Comrade Gromyko indicated that the negotiations on the armistice must be conducted by representatives of the joint American command and the command of the South Korean troops, on one side, and by representatives of the command of the Korean People’s Army and the command of the Chinese volunteers, on the other. Comrade Gromyko noted that the negotiations must be limited to military questions and first of all the question of a cease-fire.On June 29, Ridgway, who was at that time the commander of the “U.N. troops” in Korea, appealed over the radio to the commander of the Korean People’s Army Kim Il Sung with a proposal to begin negotiations for an armistice. July 1, Kim Il Sung and Peng Dehuai broadcast over the radio a joint answer to Ridgway’s appeal. The answer expressed their agreement to meet with representatives of the American command “to conduct negotiations for the cessation of military activity and the establishment of peace.” The negotiations of the representatives of the commands of the warring sides began on July 10, 1951, and continued, with breaks, for more than two years, until the end of July 1953.In the course of the negotiations such basic questions were discussed as: the establishment of a line of demarcation between the two sides for the creation of a demilitarized zone as a condition for the cessation of military activity in Korea; the elaboration of practical measures for implementing the cease-fire and armistice in Korea, including the staff, authority and functions of an apparatus for observing the implementation of the conditions of the cease-fire and armistice.By the beginning of May 1952, an agreement was reached on all questions, with the exception of the question regarding prisoners of war. Later that question was also resolved on a mutually acceptable basis.Measures undertaken by the Soviet government after the death of Stalin in many ways facilitated the conclusion of the agreement. While in Moscow for Stalin’s funeral, Zhou Enlai had conversations with Soviet leaders regarding the situation in Korea. During these conversations, Zhou Enlai, in the name of the government of the PRC, urgently proposed that the Soviet side assist the speeding up of the negotiations and the conclusion of an armistice. Such a position by the Chinese coincided with our position. For the implementation of practical measures ensuing from the complicated situation, a special representative was sent to Pyongyang from Moscow in March 1953 with a proposal for speeding up the peace negotiations. By that time the Koreans also showed a clear aspiration for the most rapid cessation of military activity. On July 27 an armistice agreement was signed in Panmunjom.The armistice agreement fixed the military demarcation line and provided for the withdrawal of troops 2 km from this line to create a demilitarized zone, [and] provided for a cease-fire and withdrawal of troops of both sides from the demilitarized zone within 72 hours after the armistice agreement takes effect. [Here follows a listing of the terms of the agreement—K.W.] V. The Korean Question after the Armistice The conclusion of the armistice in Korea created the preconditions for a peaceful reunification of the country. The first step in this direction must be the convening of the political conference envisioned in the agreement. Because of the sabotage of the USA, a political conference on Korea was convened only on April 26, 1954, in Geneva. The American delegates applied maximum efforts to prevent the adoption of the proposals of the DPRK, USSR, and PRC that aimed to create on the Korean peninsula a single, genuinely democratic government. The conference did not adopt any constructive decisions on Korea. The Korean question has remained until now within the framework of the U.N. and is considered unresolved. It is a subject of “discussion” at every regular session of the U.N. General Assembly. The government of the DPRK speaks out against the discussion of the so-called Korean question in the U.N. and in favor of disbanding the “Commission on the Reunification and Restoration of Korea” and the withdrawal of American troops from Korea. This position of the Korean leadership is fully supported by the Soviet government.FROM MATERIALS OF THEFOREIGN MINISTRY OF THE USSR[1] This figure is higher than the estimates of U.S. intelligence, according to which by June 25 the KPA numbered between 87,500 and 99,000 men. See the discussion of these figures in Cumings, The Origins of the Korean War, Vol. II, 452-53.\n",

The [North] Korean delegation was received by Emperor Bokassa and by the [Central African] Prime Minister Henri Maidou; [the North Korean delegation] had numerous discussions with local officials and visited 10 industrial and agricultural facilities, among which the Romanian-Central African joint venture Lorombois. The Korean specialists pressed the Central African Empire authorities to provide them with details on the volume and guarantees for investments, the repayment of loans, the fiscal code, the profitability of firms, the special payments for foreign specialists, the degree of qualification of the local work force, the use of production on internal and external markets, etc. The [North] Korean delegation managed to get, although only partially and after extraordinary persistence, documents which touched upon, although only marginally, the issues they were interested in. On the occasion of the final talks, with Prime Minister Henri Maidou, [Finance] Minister did not commit himself to building any of the facilities discussed (the wood industry plant, the soap factory, the ceramics factory, and the irrigated rice farm). Displaying a certain degree of unhappiness, Henri Maidou said: ‘it is clear that there are still difficulties and complex problems [we] must look into, but the two sides must undertake immediate efforts so that the agreements signed in Pyongyang are implemented by the end of the year.’The [North] Korean diplomats told us that the Central Africans proposed investments projects for the aforementioned facilities worth approximately $22 billion, being completely uneconomical and unrealistic, without an economic basis [for these demands]. At the same time, it is noteworthy that although the DPRK delegation was still in Bangui, the Central Africans put special emphasis on their relations with the regime in Seoul, on the occasion of [South Korea’s] national day, August 14, 1978. The warm telegram sent by Emperor Bokassa, referring to the necessity to reunify Korea democratically, [and] the level of participation to the reception offered by the South Korean Embassy hint at the fact that the Central African Empire will continue to draw the two Koreas into a competition [against each other] so that the [Central African Empire] can extract as many economic advantages as possible.

      "HA II/10\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBerlin, 8/23/1983Information Report About the Present Activity of the DPRK Embassy in the GDR1.1. IntroductionIn the analysis of identified activities of the DPRK Embassy in the GDR, it is to be assumed, considering the present policies of the DPRK, that the VI. Party Congress of the WPK[1] (October 1980) made the consistent execution of the ideological, technological, and cultural revolution the general line for the construction of socialism and communism.The WPK invokes the chuch’e [juche] ideology in all matters.The chuch’e ideology, whose linchpin is the term “sovereignty,” is an undialectical interpretation of Marxism-Leninism informed by the national liberation struggle but nevertheless seeks the construction of socialism in Korea.In this spirit, the WPK conducts extremely intensive political-ideological work at home and abroad, in order to propagate the chuch’e ideology.The theoretical foundation of the DPRK’s foreign policy concept is, in contrast to Marxism-Leninism, the basic evaluation of our epoch as an “epoch of nations’ striving for autonomy and independence, with the non-aligned states being the decisive revolutionary force.”On this basis, close cooperation and expansion of relations with non-aligned states is the core of the DPRK’s foreign policy.  With the goal of creating more favorable international conditions for the further construction of socialism in the DPRK, relations with socialist states are especially being developed in the economic area as well as in the scientific and technological areas.Dominating motives are to secure support for the course of peaceful unification of Korea, to prevent the establishment of diplomatic relations with South Korea by socialist and other non-aligned states, to strengthen its own positions within the Non-Aligned Movement, and to attain maximum economic and scientific-technological assistance for the DPRK.Hence, since the end of the 1970s, the DPRK endeavors to have specialists educated and receive scientific-technological achievements, including the associated know-how, from socialist and capitalist industrial countries.Recently, the party and state leadership of the DPRK, while exaggerating nationalist aspects, has been moving the struggle for peace and security more strongly into the center of its domestic and foreign policy.1.2. The State of the DPRK Embassy in the GDRThe German Democratic Republic entertains ambassadorial diplomatic relations with the DPRK since November 7, 1949.The embassy building is located at\t\t\t108 Berlin, Glinkastr. 7(until 1975 at 1157 Berlin, Dorotheastr. 4).As of 8/1/83, \t\t\t30 diplomats\t\t\tof which 27 brought their wives\t\t\t15 administrative employees with wife\t\t\t\t\tas well as\t\t\t47 childrenare accredited to the Korean Embassy.All accredited diplomats/administrative employees and family members are lodged in the embassy building.  The Korean visiting assistant professor and his family also live in the embassy.Moreover, the Embassy has rented seven apartments in the downtown of the capital, which are used for the lodging of Korean business travelers and students.Due to the central function of the Korean Embassy in the European area, according to the available information, the Embassy is structured as follows:\t\t\t\t\t\t- political department with extensive press analysis\t\t\t\t\t\t- military-political department\t\t\t\t\t\t- trade policy department\t\t\t\t\t\t- a task force employed by the CC[2] of the WPK, \t\t\t\t\t\t  with specific tasks for Western Europe\t\t\t\t\t\t- department for the delivery of materialsBesides the extensive mailing of propagandistic DPRK materials to GDR citizens, due to the low mail fees in the GDR (compared internationally), the department for the delivery of materials is also responsible for the worldwide mailing of Korean materials (a new agreement is currently being negotiated between the postal ministry of the GDR and the DPRK).  Due to the regular departure of special flights from the airport Berlin-Schönefeld to the DPRK, the Korean Embassy in Berlin is a central gathering point for goods that are to be transported to the DPRK (the Embassy receives these [goods] from Korean embassies in Western Europe, among other places).In accordance with Korean ideology and the norms derived from it, the Korean Embassy is very strictly organized, which is evidenced by the following:- general obligation to give notice of departure from the embassy, with diplomats/administrative employees only able to leave the embassy in pairs; - a daily two-hour instruction in the works of Kim Il Sung for all members of the embassy, with diplomats’ children who go to school in the GDR being educated in the embassy during school vacations;- for ideological reasons, television and radio is only permitted in common rooms of the embassy as well as in the offices of selected diplomats.2. Within the limits of the hitherto conducted and supervised operation on the DPRK Embassy in the GDR, the following generalized operational statements about the functioning of the Embassy can be made:2.1. Contact-related work of the Korean Embassy2.1.1. Personal contactsThe Embassy of the DPRK conducts a wide range of contact-politics with GDR citizen, for which \t[NAME AND PRECISE RANK REDACTED] Secretary of the Korean Embassyas well as\t[NAME AND PRECISE RANK REDACTED] Secretary of the Korean Embassy are responsible.  The basis of the formation and development of these personal contacts is in most cases tourist trips to the DPRK by GDR citizens, for which GDR citizens inform themselves about Korea ahead of time at the DPRK Embassy and, as a result, receive materials about the DPRK through the Korean travel agency “Korea International Tourist Bureau, Pyongyang,” whereupon they frequently contact the Embassy.For other persons contacted, their stays in the 60s, carried out for the purpose of completing a common economic project between the GDR and the DPRK in Hamhŭng, form the basis of contacts with [NAME REDACTED] and [NAME REDACTED], especially since [NAME REDACTED] back then was appointed to the supervision of GDR specialists in Hamhŭng.  Still existing sponsorship-relations with institutions or establishments carrying the name “Kim Il Sung” are also a basis of contact.It is to be noted that [NAME REDACTED] and [NAME REDACTED] sporadically engage in contact activities and primarily use them to request from their contact partners that congratulatory cards (i.e., laudatory articles) and congratulatory telegrams be sent to official Korean posts on the occasion of particular highlights in the DPRK, such as - the birthday of Kim Il Sung- the birthday of Kim Jong Il- the anniversary of the founding of the WPK,for which the contact partners, in part, are specifically sought out.The chief concern of their contact activity is the popularization and propagandization of the accomplishments of the DPRK, with particular attention being dedicated to the portrayal of Kim Il Sung as the founder of the chuch’e ideology. Through the predominant propagandization of Korean politics vis-à-vis their contact partners, [NAME REDACTED] and [NAME REDACTED] endeavor to develop concordant opinions, in order to portray the growing interest for Korean developments among the GDR population as an achievement of the work of the DPRK embassy.Besides the already mentioned avenues for the attainment of this goal, both diplomats use their contacts for the wide circulation of Korean propaganda material.  Furthermore, a selection of contact partners with sufficient language proficiency are commissioned for the short-term translation of various materials.It is interesting that [NAME REDACTED] and [NAME REDACTED] show a general interest in the career development, family situation, hobby, and recreational activities of their contact partners, yet both diplomats survey their contact partners only superficially and not comprehensively in accordance with the real volume of information.  Instead, they broach questions about the development of the GDR and the socialist community of states only in relation to Korean happenings, in order to evidence the correctness of the chuch’e ideology.In accordance with the Korean ideology, [NAME REDACTED] and [NAME REDACTED] also do not seek a discussion about global political problems.Next to the contacts with GDR citizens, [NAME REDACTED] and [NAME REDACTED] are tasked with the supervision of Korean citizens staying in the GDR for the purposes of education and work.Due to the organizational principles of the Korean Embassy, the students are directly, i.e., through someone who is responsible for them, in weekly contact with the Embassy.  Instruction in the study of the teachings of Kim Il Sung as well as a general reporting on task fulfillment occurs during this contact.In consequence of the cooperative bases (direct agreements, party relations WPK/SED, cultural-exchange plan), the Korean citizens enjoy “freedoms” beyond the concrete educational objective, which make it possible to gain comprehensive insight into the respective educational areas.2.1.2. Receptions and official contacts of the Embassy on the occasion of social highlights of the DPRK:- birthday of Kim Il Sung – 4/15- birthday of Kim Jong Il – 2/16- anniversary of the founding of the WPK – 10/10- anniversary of the founding of the Korean People’s Army – 4/25- anniversary of the founding of the DPRK – 9/9- anniversary of the victory of the Korean masses – 7/23- anniversary of the founding of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan – 5/28[During these events] receptions and film cocktails are regularly conducted in the Korean Embassy, during which, besides representatives from the diplomatic corps and official representatives of companies and institutions, a constant group of people of approx. 25 GDR citizens (Friends of Korea), which is known to HA II/10, regularly participates.Furthermore, an incessantly changing group of people is invited through the Embassy to participate in receptions/events, whose function lies in the documentation of a heightened interest in DPRK politics among the GDR population.  This incessantly changing group of people is the result of existing short-term contacts with the Korean Embassy.It can be estimated that these events always carry a propagandistic character and serve the popularization and propagandization of DPRK politics, especially the achievements of Kim Il Sung.Characteristic of the demeanor of Korean diplomats during such receptions in the Korean Embassy and other events of the diplomatic corps is that they, in accordance with the goals of the politics of the WPK, conduct extensive networking with representatives from developing countries, states from the Non-Aligned Movement, as well as diplomats from the Chinese Embassy, in order to increase their influence on these countries in terms of the chuch’e ideology.Moreover, the trade policy department of the Embassy maintains extensive commercial contacts with GDR companies and company representatives from the FRG/West Berlin.In line with the economic and party relations between the SED and the WPK, numerous Korean delegations are in the GDR and, in the course of their visits, realize special company tours in accordance with their wishes, through which there also arise good opportunities for a comprehensive gathering of information about economic and political questions.Furthermore, in the framework of tourist exchange, every year a group (24 people) from the DPRK visits the GDR.The DPRK tourist group consists of people specifically selected by the party and state organs, people whose mission is to gather scientific-technological and other information that can be useful for the development of the DPRK.Operationally relevant is the fact that these delegations are in part accompanied by staff from the Korean Embassy, that is, they maintain contact with the Embassy during their sojourn in the GDR.The following generalizations can be made about the activity of the military-political department of the Korean Embassy:The military attaché of the Korean Embassy, Ri Dong Il, fulfills the duties that are within the framework of his diplomatic activity, and, in front of official representatives from the MfNV[3], he displays efforts to further develop the relations between the Korean People’s Army and the NPA[4] of the GDR.The deputy to Ri Dong Il is [NAME REDACTED], who, besides his diplomatic activity, is also active for the Korean foreign trade company “Moran” (procurement for the Korean Ministry of Defense), for which he maintains contacts to specific foreign trade companies in the GDR.In this connection, one should note the existence of a group of Korean diplomats within the Embassy who are protected by their diplomatic activities and, according to the intelligence of Department X, carry out specific tasks—by order of the WPK—with regard to South Koreans living in Western Europe.It can be assessed that through the multi-layered official contacts of the Korean Embassy extensive opportunities for information gathering on economic and political questions become available, and thus the Embassy’s utilization of individual GDR contact partners’ volume of information (unofficial informant, the Embassy’s circle of friends) is not totally necessary, especially since they are only superficially and primarily made familiar with Korean politics.2.1.3. Distribution of materialsAnother form of the Korean Embassy’s activity is the extensive sending of materials to a wide-ranging group of people (approx. 250 per month).  Included in this distribution are a wide variety of current materials or speeches of DPRK representatives as well as daily newspapers and periodicals.The bases of the distribution of materials are- personal and private contacts with the Embassy;- commercial contacts with the Embassy;- scientific, i.e., professional, interest in the DPRK;- addresses of people who used to live in the DPRK for personal reasons, with the Korean Embassy receiving the addresses from the Korean travel agency (DPRK travel agency R.J.T.B. Pyongyang).3. Theater of operations – West BerlinOperationally to be noted is the existence of a South Korean consulate general in West Berlin 30, Ansbacher Str. 5.According to the available information, its main duty consists of consular activity in the monitoring and surveillance of all South Koreans living in West Berlin and in finding out the contacts held by this group of people. Furthermore, it has been ascertained that [NAME REDACTED], who was active at the consulate general until May 1983, was directly active in terms of intelligence service.  Therefore it must be assumed that the successor to [NAME REDACTED] will take over the diplomatic as well as intelligence service duties of [NAME REDACTED].In its intelligence service activity, the South Korean CIA assumes that a relatively large group of South Koreans who live in West Berlin maintain personal contacts with the Embassy of the DPRK (cannot be supported operationally).According to the available information, this results in the following main tasks that became noticeable in the intelligence service activity of [NAME REDACTED]:1. gathering of personal information about South Korean citizens in West Berlin who have contact with the DPRK Embassy in the GDR;2. gathering of intelligence about Korean citizens living in the GDR;3. gathering of information about negotiations between DPRK delegations and FRG companies;4. gathering of intelligence about the activity of the Korean Embassy in the GDR.Furthermore, in line with the operation “Forscher” it became known that the DPRK Embassy in the GDR is also in the process of gathering intelligence about a CIA office located in West Berlin.In this connection, the commercial contacts between West Berlin and the Korean Embassy gain particular operational significance.The following measures are required for the further monitoring of the Embassy of the DPRK:1. constant evaluation of monitoring measures introduced with regard to the Embassy, the goal being the discovery of further contacts with the Embassy and an operational assessment.\tresponsible: \tAuI.2. creation of two new and stable unofficial informant contacts with the Korean Embassy, especially with the diplomats [NAME REDACTED] and [NAME REDACTED].\tresponsible: \tSergeant Major Kieshauer\ttarget dates: \tsearch\t\t\t\t\t- 10/30/1983\t\t\tintelligence gathering\t\t\t- 12/30/1983\t\t\testablishment of contact\t\t- 1/30/19843. guaranteeing of stable intelligence relations with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs/Sector, with the goal of giving up-to-date evaluations of the situation and coordinating necessary measures\tresponsible: \tCaptain Herrmann4.

They warn us not to take any step that would harm Hungarian-DPRK relations and our common line toward the Korean comrades.As his private opinion, [Head of the 1st Far Eastern Department of the Soviet Foreign Ministry] Comrade [Mikhail Stepanovich] Kapitsa told [me] that we should not rebuff the South Koreans in a rude way. Some kind of contact may be useful in the future. To illustrate how carefully this issue must be handled, he mentioned that approx. 2 months earlier, the Korean comrades had given an information note to the MID, in which they disapprovingly described when and under which circumstances the Soviet envoys, at various diplomatic posts abroad, greeted, shook hands with, or sat at the same table as South Korean diplomats.      – Monori – 423 –\n",

      "Telegram from Pyongyang received 1 Dec. 1961 On the 28 November, Albanian students studying at Kim Il Sung University in Pyongyang held a party on the occasion of the Albanian state holiday. During the party, they propagated the position of the Albanian leadership and its destructive line. Besides the Korean students, Chinese and Vietnamese students also took part. According to the Hungarian comrades, the refreshments were provided by the Chinese embassy. The most important guest at the party was Kim Il Sung's son, who is a student at Kim Il Sung University and has been reportedly maintaining very close friendly relations with the Albanian students for some time. He has been inviting them home to meet his family. Before their state holiday, the Albanian students, after lengthy discussions with the Korean comrades, succeeded in securing permission to hang portraits of Stalin in their rooms. After the initial animosity against Albanian students that began to be apparent among Korean students after the 22nd Congress, when the latter became acquainted with the materials of the congress in Russian, the Albanian students launched a major initiative to gain the sympathy of both Korean students and students from other countries. A great help to them was precisely Kim Il Sung's son, who as early as the time of the Albanians' arrival in the DPRK headed the welcoming committee and organized a warm welcome for them. Among the students of the university, Kim Il Sung's son has been enjoying great respect and has tremendous influence on their thinking. Kohoušek 141\n",

Thanking for the message, the Spanish ambassador replied that the request would be forwarded to his home country. The problem is not simple, he said, because Spain maintains diplomatic relations with South Korea. The request could still be examined and the experience of the countries that maintain diplomatic relations with both South Korea and North Korea will be considered.During a casual meeting, I informed the ambassador of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea about the results.

      "The following officials attended the discussion: Stefan Andrei, Central Committee of the Romanian Communist Party Secretary and Dumitru Turcus, Deputy Head of Section within the Central Committee of the Romanian Communist Party. Pak Jung-guk, the DPRK ambassador to Bucharest also attended.Comrade Nicolae Ceausescu:Are you enjoying yourself in Romania?Kim Dong-gyu:Yes, thank you very much. Owing to your care and to that of other comrades in the party and state leadership we are enjoying ourselves very much, We can actually say we’re feeling as if we were at home.Thank you very much for the attention you are paying to our delegation. Thank you for this welcome, especially since you’re so busy at the moment.Comrade Nicolae Ceausescu:I would like to greet your party’s delegation once again, above all [to greet] comrade Kim Dong-gyu. We are happy that such a representative delegation took part in the workings of our Congress. We see it as an expression of the collaborative relations between our parties and our peoples. We see it as an expression of our collaborative relations which have been developing and are ever increasingly developing, between our parties, as we have agreed.Kim Dong-gyu:Thank you. I had the opportunity to take part in the workings of your party’s Congress, and I had the opportunity to convey to you our warm regards. But in addition, I was assigned by comrade Kim Il Sung to congratulate you right after the party elections, since he thought that the congratulations telegram will not reach you right away. I would like you to think of all these [gestures] as the embodiment of the extraordinary attention that comrade Kim Il Sung is giving you. We believe that your election as secretary general [of the Romanian Communist Party] is a perfectly natural thing. We believe that your election is absolutely normal, especially since you have acquired so much experience in fighting for the interests of the Romanian people, over a period of forty years; you are a figure that did his best to unite the people around the Romanian Communist Party.Your election is an important factor for the unity of the international communist and workers’ movement. We view the Report you presented at the [Romanian Communist Party] Congress as a report which clears up the way ahead for Romania to build the socialist society and thereafter to build the communist society. By taking part in the workings of your Congress we could clearly see the high regard and trust that the party, the Romanian people have for you. Your unanimous election to the fore of the party is an extraordinarily positive thing for the future of the relations amongst our parties as well. Our delegation highly appreciates the fact that you were elected at the peak of the party, and the fact that several comrades to whom we pay special attention and with which we are linked through a deep friendship were also elected to the top echelons of the party.Comrade Nicolae Ceausescu:I would like to deeply thank you for the greetings and wishes conveyed by comrade Kim Il Sung. Needless to say, I appreciate the fact that such a representative delegation was sent to [our] party’s Congress, and I regard the greetings, congratulations and wishes sent by comrade Kim Il Sung as proof of the excellent relations between our parties, between our parties and our countries, Romania and the DPRK.I would like to take this opportunity to express my satisfaction and that of our party’s leadership for the rising development of relations between our parties and peoples in all fields, and I would like to express my conviction that they will continue to develop.Comrade Kim Dong-gyu:Thank you.Comrade Nicolae Ceausescu:Please tell comrade Kim Il Sung about our desire to increase our cooperation, and even more, tell him about our desire to have him in Romania.Comrade Kim Dong-gyu:I assure you I will pass on the invitation and, at the same time, I’d like to tell you that we, including comrade Kim Il Sung, bear in mind at all times the issue of his visit to Romania. Please grant me all your trust on this matter and do not treat my statements as a personal point of view, but as a reflection of our entire leadership, including the opinion of comrade Kim Il Sung.Comrade Nicolae Ceausescu:As far as Romania is concerned, you attended our Congress, you became aware of the preoccupations we have with respect to internal development, you heard what we said about outcomes, shortages, and you also heard the criticisms brought forward. As for international matters, they were also broadly discussed, I wouldn’t want to dwell on them right now. We believe it is necessary to strengthen the unity, collaboration between revolutionary parties, between all anti-imperialist forces, so as to accelerate our struggle against imperialist policies, to guarantee a new type of international politics. In this respect, we believe it is for the better to have as strong a collaboration between our parties and peoples as possible, and we wish to intensify this collaboration. You saw that the big powers strike deals on all problems. In the end they reach an agreement. Comrade Kim Dong-gyu:We are aware of the content of the Report you presented at the Congress and we believe that what you said perfectly corresponds to the principles that should form the basis of international relations, principles that should form the basis of relations amongst states and the problem of how to apply the principles of Marxism-Leninism according to the state of affairs in each country. As you well know, our country is divided because of our enemies’ complot, and the situation is quite tough. With respect to your support that you have given us in the Report from your Congress, it is an extraordinarily important impetus for the struggle of our people, and therefore, I would like to take this opportunity to thank you. We really appreciate the fact that in the Report, you mention that you will support the struggle of our people for the unification of the country in the future as well, and the actions and struggle of other peoples that help us.We act with a view to peacefully and independently uniting our country, but, as you know, the North-South dialogue has been stalling. We are not guilty in any way for this situation; it’s only the fault of the puppets in the South and the American imperialists. However, we deem it necessary, and we will even try to maintain these North-South contacts, to continue to develop a general political action.As you know, we adopted several approaches to unite the country, including contacting the US Senate, but despite all these, our problems have not been solved. Not long ago, [the South Koreans] have intensified their actions, through which they infringe upon the agreements we reached at our meetings. South Korea is under foreign influence and at the 63rd Session of the United Democratic Fatherland Front of Korea we pointed out that in these conditions we can’t achieve the unification of the country peacefully as long as Park Chung Hee. For this reason, we asked for the North-South negotiations to continue between social and political organizations and that progressive parties in both Koreas strengthen [their ranks] and convene a Great National Assembly for both Koreas. When we put this forward, we took into account the fact that, in South Korea, there were massive workers and student protests, mass demonstrations, and our proposal is an impetus in the struggle of the masses [against occupiers], [and] on the other hand it is a factor that could lead to the growing isolation of the leadership in South Korea. Park Chung Hee found himself in a tough spot, but it is for this very reason that [U.S. President Gerald] Ford visited [South Korea] and released a very aggressive communiqué to the press. According to this communiqué, the Americans declared that they would not pull out their troops from South Korea and that they would help modernize the South Korean army and that in case of a certain situation occurring, they would intervene. I am telling you, comrade Nicolae Ceausescu, all these things because our relations are very good. After his visit to South Korea and after releasing the reactionary communiqué, Ford went to Vladivostok, where he talked to the First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Of course, we do not know what happened there. For the time being we cannot say how Brezhnev talked to Ford and what the former told the latter.Comrade Nicolae Ceausescu:‘Pravda’ reports that the Soviets got along [with Ford] even better than with Nixon!Comrade Kim Dong-gyu:The situation in South Korea is pretty severe also because the North-South dialogue is stalling for the time being. We know that just like before, you, comrade Ceausescu and your party will do everything to support our actions to unify the country, and I want to take this opportunity to pass on our thanks to your entire party. Honestly speaking, we have many friends and none of them, with your exception, could commit to sending those letters to the US Congress. Only your party, which is assuming an independent position, [based on] national sovereignty, supported us with this issue.Comrade Nicolae Ceausescu:We took and will continue to take [all necessary measures] in the spirit of solidarity, to increase the influence of the DPRK, to reach a resolution for this problem, ultimately to unify the country, and we are certain that [all these] will be achieved.Comrade Kim Dong-gyu:Thank you.Comrade Nicolae Ceausescu:I agree that the unification of the country will only be achieved through peaceful means, and through the intensification of the people’s struggle, both in the South and in the North to draw them closer to one another.Comrade Kim Dong-gyu:That is exactly where the problem is: it is progressing very slowly. Our door is wide open.Comrade Nicolae Ceausescu:Of course, it is not easy to carry out a political struggle but, you see, changes sometimes happen very fast. Your efforts to establish contacts will expedite the process of unification. You probably saw that in Portugal these changes occurred all of a sudden and they created the conditions for the demise of colonialism. In Greece, the military dictatorship perished in a few hours. Therefore, the intensification of the political struggle and contacts  will expedite this process of strengthening of reactionary [sic] forces in South Korea, and the presence of the United States cannot precluded it, as it managed to do in Greece.Comrade Kim Dong-gyu:We fully agree with your overview of the international arena.Comrade Nicolae Ceausescu:Of course, it is necessary to intensify international contacts.Comrade Kim Dong-gyu:It is indeed a very important aspect.Comrade Nicolae Ceausescu:Because that will give a powerful boost to the position of the DPRK.Comrade Kim Dong-gyu:That is correct.Comrade Nicolae Ceausescu:And of course, you must not give up developing your contacts with the US, with the US House of Representatives, with political figures in the US.Comrade Kim Dong-gyu:We too are doing our best to get in touch with them. It is for this reason that we proposed signing the peace treaty with the United States.Comrade Nicolae Ceausescu:The situation can be made clear for the US public opinion by inviting some representatives from the US Senate and journalists.Comrade Kim Dong-gyu:It is indeed necessary [to do so].Comrade Nicolae Ceausescu:And that will fuel a certain position against Ford and his administration.Comrade Kim Dong-gyu:Without any doubt, the factors you mentioned with respect to the situation in Greece and Portugal are favorable to the struggle we are carrying on as well. However, the situation in South Korea is different from the situation in other countries. There is a reactionary in South Korea which is supported internally by foreign forces and therefore it is harder to foresee that there will be a coup.Comrade Nicolae Ceausescu:Even more so, there can be coups overnight.Comrade Kim Dong-gyu:Compared to other countries, the situation [in South Korea] is complicated because they are dependent on the Americans politically, militarily and economically. Comrade Nicolae Ceausescu:Even more so, it is for this reason that the sentiment against foreign presence must be cultivated.Comrade Kim Dong-gyu:[Indeed,] that is why we now mainly stress the democratization of social-political life in South Korea and therefore, we are doing our best to replace Park Chung Hee with a relatively democratic and progressive personality. The problem is that the North is blamed for everything that is going on right now in South Korea, as there are rumors that there are spies from the North, and the South Koreans are therefore carrying out a vicious campaign against communists and [other forces.]Comrade Nicolae Ceausescu:The prospects are nonetheless good.Comrade Kim Dong-gyu:Thank you for your judgment, and you must know that we are optimistic too.Comrade Nicolae Ceausescu:I am planning a trip to Japan this spring. They are indeed talking about changing Tanaka but irrespective of any changes my visit is set.Comrade Kim Dong-gyu:We believe that these visits are good. It is paramount to influence public opinion in Japan.Thank you very much for receiving me, especially since you are so busy. We could talk for ages, but generally we know the situation of our relations very well.Once again, I would like to warmly thank you, on behalf of the entire delegation, for receiving us. I would like to wish you good health, a lot of success in your work and to express my firm belief that the tasks you adopted at the recent Party Congress will be carried out successfully. I assure you that upon my return home I will pass on your exact words to our leader, comrade Kim Il Sung.Comrade Nicolae Ceausescu:Once more, I would like to thank comrade Kim Dong-gyu and the other comrades who took part in the workings of our Congress and I would like to wish you success in your activity and good health.Please pass on to your party and people our wishes of success in the achievement of the peaceful unification of the country and the construction of socialism and once again, to comrade Kim Il Sung our best wishes for his health and successes in his work.Comrade Kim Dong-gyu:Thank you very much.2 copies\n",

      "TELEGRAM  085579To: the Romanian Ministry of Foreign AffairsFrom: the Romanian Embassy in Washington, DCSubject: US – South Korea relationsDate: December 15, 1977Classification: SecretDuring discussions with Comrade Petre Anghel, Third Secretary, David Blakemore, Deputy Director of the Korea Desk, and Robert Martens, Director of Regional Topics in the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, both at the US Department of State, noted: American-South Korean relations are presently going through a tense period, whose outcomes are difficult to predict. This situation is due to pressure from the US [on the ROK] to fulfill certain objectives at a time when either the government in Seoul was unprepared to achieve, or these objectives interfered with South Korean plans for strengthening its economic and military forces. The result has been the current state of affairs, in which bilateral relations are being tested by three very difficult and interdependent issues: US ground troop withdrawal, human rights and the current investigation led by a committee of the House of Representatives against the government in Seoul, regarding actions of corruption and influence in the decision process of Congress and the US administration. 1. American ground troop withdrawal. This foreign policy measure was announced by Jimmy Carter when he was still a candidate for President of the United States and became directive post-inauguration, when he assumed office in the White House. Although the measure was not explained in detail, following pressures from Japan and the US military, the Carter administration decided to gradually withdraw troops within a period of 4-5 years, in close consultation with the two aforementioned countries and providing adequate material and financial assistance. In view of the withdrawal, the administration has already forwarded to Congress a funding request pending approval, in regards to selling military equipment to the South Korean government and compensating for the first troop withdrawals scheduled for 1978 – approximately 6000 combatants. The request is structured in such a manner that the material compensation will precede the complete troop withdrawal scheduled for the most part at the end of the 4-5-year period. Although the two representatives of the US State Department firmly stated that the first drawback will take place in 1978, they were unsure whether Congress would approve the requested funding necessary for an adequate planning of the full withdrawal. This is due to an increasingly stronger view in Congress to suspend all transfers of military equipment until Seoul decides to cooperate with Washington in resolving the aforementioned allegations and ensures it will take appropriate measures to improve human rights. 2. The human rights issue. This has become an important aspect of American-South Korean bilateral relations and is closely followed, especially by the US. Congress hearings on the issue have emphasized the connection between the attention offered by Seoul in respecting human rights, on the one hand, and the economic and military assistance from the US, on the other. Despite the Carter administration’s commitment to human rights, the directorate for political affairs of the Department of State is trying to minimize the potential negative effects as much as possible, under the justification that South Korean security and economic development, including US assistance, must not be threatened since they hold undeniable priority in maintaining Korean independence and balance on the Korean Peninsula. 3. The scandal sparked by allegations of influence against South Korean officials has not only raised questions regarding American-South Korean bilateral relations, but also led to serious pressures on the South Korean government from both Congress and the Carter administration. This has increased the tension between the two countries. Given that numerous members of the House of Representatives are involved in the scandal, proving them guilty could negatively affect their stance towards the administration’s request to continue offering assistance to Seoul. This entire situation, as well as Seoul’s economic achievements, has led to strengthening South Korea’s national pride and confidence in its own abilities. Consequently, the US State Department representatives mentioned that Seoul might decide to increasingly distance itself from the United States, if the pressures continue, although this is a very remote possibility.

      "Secret Document 16Foreign Ministry FileRecord of Third Conversation between Premier Zhou Enlai and President Nasser(Premier has yet to review and approve)Time: 19 December 1963, 5:30 p.m. to 10 p.m.Place: Qubba Palace, CairoOur side’s participants: Vice Premier Chen Yi, Deputy Director Kong Yuan, Vice Minister Huang Zhen, Ambassador Chen Jiakang, Department Director Wang YutianReceiving side’s participants: Vice Premier Amer, Executive Council President Sabri, Presidential Council Member Rifaat, Foreign Minister Fawzi, Ambassador to China Imam, Presidency Secretary-General FaridInterpreter: Ji ChaozhuRecorders: Zhou Jue, Zhou MingjiZhou: Please, Your Excellency the President, you speak first.Nasser: It would be better to ask the Premier to speak first.Zhou: In that case, I will speak a bit. The last time Your Excellency the President asked with concern in regard to international issues and the issue of our country’s relations with some countries. I think that the issue most attracting the attention of the entire world is that of China and the United States. Indeed, since our country gained liberation and we founded New China, relations between China and the United States have always been bad. In the past, I spoke of this issue at the Bandung Conference. Relations between China and the United States are not good. Our side is not responsible for this. We have always been friendly to the American people.  The crux of the problem can be traced back to the Cairo Conference, late in the Second World War. At that time three countries -- the United States, Britain, and China -- issued the Cairo Declaration, recognizing that Japan after the war must return to China the Chinese territory of Taiwan, which Japan invaded and occupied in 1894. At that time it was Chiang Kai-shek who participated in the conference on the Chinese side (I also saw this morning that hotel where he stayed when he was in Cairo). After Japan surrendered, China’s Chiang Kai-shek government at that time sent someone in the latter half of 1945 to take control of Taiwan, appointed him provincial governor, and had Taiwan become a part of Chinese territory and a province of China. If Taiwan does not belong to China, then Chiang Kai-shek today cannot stay on Taiwan. With the liberation of the Chinese mainland, after Chiang Kai-shek went to Taiwan, in the latter half of 1949US President Truman declared that Taiwan was a part of China, that the fight between Chiang Kai-shek and the Chinese mainland was a civil war, and that the United States would not interfere. In 1950 the United States published a white paper and continued with this position. Taiwan’s jurisdiction and status were not at issue but, because of the Korean War, became an issue. After the Korean War broke out, US and UN forces invaded north of the 38th parallel and advanced toward the Yalu River that is the common border of China and Korea. China’s government for this reason issued a warning, stating that if the war expanded to the Yalu River, threatening New China’s existence, China would have to become involved and could not ignore it. This warning was passed via the Indian ambassador to the United States. But the US government paid no attention to this warning. Not only this, but the United States also seized the opportunity to use its fleet to occupy Taiwan, turning Taiwan into a protectorate. This shows that the US occupation of Taiwan, following the launching of a war of aggression against Korea, was something planned in advance. In October 1950US and UN forces drew near the bank of the Yalu River. At this time China finally could not but send its own volunteer army to aid Korea. The Korean War was then fought for two and a half years. When we were helping Korea resist, we proposed that, if only the US military would withdraw from North Korea, the issue could be peacefully resolved. It was like your movie “Saladin,” which I saw last night, on the one hand fighting the enemy and on the other hand negotiating. With regard to negotiations over the Korean issue, they began from July 1951 and concluded in 1953, lasting a total of two years. The first step in the talks was both sides signing the armistice agreement and preparing the second step, the signing of a peace treaty conducive to Korean unification. But in 1954, in the negotiations of the Geneva Conference, there was a failure to conclude the issue of signing a peace treaty, thereby creating a kind of unstable armistice situation. The US 7th Fleet has since remained in the Taiwan Strait without leaving, occupying Taiwan.In Indochina, the 1954Geneva Conference reached an agreement, recognizing the situation of North and South Vietnam’s temporary division and agreeing, following France’s military withdrawal, on the issue of a unified Vietnam through North-South peace talks. Laos and Cambodia also obtained independence through that conference. But the United States was quite special, participating in the negotiations but not signing the agreement. The US representative said that they were neither wrecking the accords but nor were they signing them. In reality, the United States is presently wrecking the accords. As soon as the French forces left, US forces immediately entered. In this way is now created day by day a state of tension. In Laos, France left and the United States then entered, making the civil war start again. After every effort, in the period 1961 – 1962there was held in Geneva a conference with regard to settling the issue of Laos with China’s government participating through Foreign Minister Marshall Chen Yi.Chen: At the time of the Geneva Conference，US Secretary of State Rusk asked Harriman to approach me. For days he stared at me like a fly, but I paid no attention to him.Zhou: The conference adopted a declaration of Lao neutrality. The United States signed this time but still kept giving weapons to the Lao right wing. The United States also gave a small share of weapons to the neutral faction of Prince Phouma. The Laos issue in reality is not resolved.As for Cambodia, it has resolutely implemented a policy of peaceful neutrality. Cambodia receives military equipment as aid from the United States, as well as some US loans, but at the same time also receives some help from us. The US, thus displeased with Cambodia, is thinking of how to overthrow Prince Sihanouk, as well as how to use South Vietnam and Thailand against Cambodia to carry out an attack from both sides. Recently Sihanouk was forced to declare that he was temporarily requesting the withdrawal of US and British diplomatic personnel.The above shows that the US is drawing near New China’s area, making the Taiwan Strait, South Korea, and Indochina three areas of tension and carrying out hostility against China. In the latter half of 1954, the United States also organized the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) countries to encircle and counter China. At that time Britain also stood together with the United States in wishing to split Taiwan off from China as an independent political unit. Then on the eve of the 1955 Bandung Conference, SEATO held a meeting in Bangkok. Eden, at that time Britain’s foreign minister, sent a telegram requesting that he and I meet on China’s border, that is to say between Hong Kong and the mainland. I asked him what issue we were to discuss. The opposite party said: the mediation of relations between China and the United States. The condition was that I recognize Taiwan’s status as uncertain. This was the first time that Britain conveyed the US view, dividing Taiwan from China. The policy that imperialism adopts here is the same as with Pakistan. This year Britain on the one hand voted at the UN General Assembly in support of our country but at the same time also declared that Taiwan’s status was still uncertain. The United States and Britain in these practices have both nullified the “Cairo Declaration.” From1955 to the present, the attitude of the United States and Britain on this issue have been identical.Not only does New China not recognize “two Chinas,” but Chiang Kai-shek, entrenched on Taiwan, also says that Taiwan is a province of China and does not agree to its separation. No Chinese agrees to Taiwan’s separation. Just as with the Arab countries, even the most reactionary ruler cannot but recognize that Palestine is Arab territory.Why has imperialism organized such countries as Thailand, Pakistan, Australia, and the Philippines into SEATO? Recently there has been conflict on the Sino-Indian border, and the United States again is vigorously grasping for India. The aim, then, is to form a crescent encirclement against socialist New China. In a previous conversation with Premier Sabri, I said that in the final speech that US President Kennedy had prepared for October 22 in Dallas [sic – reference to speech written for the Trade Mart in Dallas, Texas, for delivery on 22 November 1963], he proposed encircling socialist countries with nine countries: South Korea, Taiwan, South Vietnam, Thailand, India, Pakistan, Iran, Turkey, and Greece. In his prepared speech, Kennedy did not bring up the Philippines, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, or member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), but he did put in India, which can indicate the current status of India. In his prepared speech he also said that in these countries are organized 3.5 million troops, whose cost is only 10 percent that of organizing the same number of US soldiers. That is to say, the United States is attempting to use the people of these nine countries to fight their battles. It is asking Asians to fight in Asia, Europeans to fight in Europe. US military spending in the next fiscal year still increases as before, because of this. From the viewpoint of the nine countries, the spearhead of the US invasion is mainly against New China. Among the nine, six countries are directly related to China. Only the three Western countries are for countering other socialist countries.Be that as it may, I still want to sit down with the United States and negotiate a settlement to the conflict. As I said earlier, in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, I proposed that if the US military would simply withdraw south of the 38th parallel, we could then cease fire. The result was that after the US military withdrew, the war stopped. In 1958, the Chinese People’s Volunteer Army furthermore withdrew in its entirety from Korea. The US forces remaining in Korea have been reduced from the previous seven divisions to three divisions, but their weapons have become even more powerful with tactical nuclear weapons.Owing to Britain’s good offices, in August 1955, ambassadorial-level talks between China and the United States started in Geneva. Meetings have taken place over 100 times, the site has moved from Geneva to Warsaw, and at present they continue still. After eight and one half years have passed, you can no longer say that we reject talks, can you? The issue is there can be no haggling over principle. First of all, we believe that both sides must abide by the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, then seek the way to resolve the issue. Indeed, the first of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence is mutual respect for each other's territorial sovereignty and integrity. The United States has destroyed this principle. The United States did not want to sign at the first Geneva Conference to resolve the issue of Indochina. Nor does the United States want to withdraw from Taiwan. Taiwan, China’s territory, cannot serve as a protectorate of the United States. Yesterday evening I watched your film, “Saladin,” this national hero of ancient Arabia said to his enemies, “This is Arab land, you may make pilgrimages here, but you must leave.” If the United States agrees to withdraw from Taiwan, China and the United States naturally can get along in peace and friendship. The United States has even said that it could recognize that China has the right to say that Taiwan belongs to China. But at present the United States does not leave, so it is necessary to allow the US military to stay on Taiwan for a while. At this time, Chiang Kai-shek exists by himself as a political regime. This, then, is making “two Chinas,” which would require me to trade in principles. Second, it would require us to recognize as legal the US military invasion of Taiwan. I cannot agree to it. Owing to an inability to reach agreement on the basis of the two principles mentioned above, China and the United States as a result have been holding discussions all this time and relations between China and the United States have been somewhat tense. But this kind of tension is not severe, and it appears improbable that it would lead to war. In the past, Dulles has engaged in brinkmanship. He tried it before. The United States and Chiang continuously sent armed operatives to harass the mainland, carried out airdrops, and sent U-2aircraft for reconnaissance, carrying out every kind of armed provocation. In 1958 Chiang’s military on the island of Quemoy carried out the shelling of mainland Xiamen and we hit back with concentrated firepower, once more creating tension. But we abide by the principle of fighting a civil war with Chiang Kai-shek alone, not dragging the United States into it. We have not opened fire on the United States. For example, if US aircraft violate our airspace or territorial waters, we only give a warning. We do not open fire. The United States, too, orders its navy not to go into our territorial waters. Why is this？ Because allied countries of the United States do not want to fight China. Britain and France do not want to do it, nor do Canada or Australia. The majority of the people of the United States also oppose fighting for Chiang Kai-shek. The United States at that time wanted Chiang Kai-shek to withdraw from the mainland’s coast. But Chiang, fearing that he would lose contact with the mainland after an evacuation, fall further under US control, and one day be eliminated like Syngman Rhee and Ngo Dinh Diem, did not dare do so.There is no armed conflict between China and the United States. The civil war between the Chinese people and Chiang Kai-shek is not finished. Whatever the method adopted to finish it, this is an issue of China’s sovereignty. We are striving for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan, but when necessary one also should recognize that we have the right to use military force. The US forcible occupation of Taiwan is an international issue, because it is the United States that forcibly occupies territory of our country. Another issue is that between the Chinese people and Chiang Kai-shek. It is an internal issue of China. These two issues cannot be mixed together. The reason why the United States wants to turn this into a single issue, its goal, is the separation of Taiwan and the making of “two Chinas.” This is the crux of our UN struggle.One cannot place the issue of China on a par with those of Germany and Vietnam. This is because the issue of China is a result of the Second World War. Other issues are affirmed by treaty, such as those of Korea and Indochina. The issue of Germany, too, is one left over after the war. It is quite complicated. West Germany has never recognized two Germanys. But the issue of China is entirely the result of Chiang Kai-shek’s civil war. Chiang Kai-shek’s continuing presence on Taiwan is a continuation of China’s civil war. Taiwan reverted to China after the Second World War. The only thing that the United Nations must do is to restore China’s legal status. It should drive out Chiang Kai-shek’s representative. Taiwan cannot have the representative of any independent political unit remain in the United Nations. One cannot say, then, that one can both recognize China and have Chiang Kai-shek’s representative remain in the United Nations. Were New China and Chiang Kai-shek both to have a representative, no matter what the organization or organ of the United Nations, we would both refuse to participate. Until now Chiang Kai-shek, too, has not recognized “two Chinas.” The reason is that, one he did so, he would be declaring that he no longer “represents China.” His cadres and military forces would then immediately come apart. Therefore, this “two Chinas” issue has always been one that the White House unceasingly argued. Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Johnson have all been the same. But we believe there will come a day, as the general trend indicates, when an absolute majority in the United Nations will recognize New China as the sole legal representative. China will in the end recover its rights in the United Nations.The United States has now adopted two tricks in the United Nations. One is to do everything possible to postpone discussion on the pretext that the issue supposedly is not a substantial one. Another is to engage in “two Chinas.” Britain now works for the United States and in the future could force Chiang Kai-shek to accept it. Chiang Kai-shek has grown old. It is also possible that after his death his successor would be forced to accept it. Our position is that it would be better not to join the United Nations. Nor would we agree to have Chiang Kai-shek’s representative participate at the same time or agree to “two Chinas.” This is because agreeing to it would then be selling away territory. This principle is one on which we cannot yield. It is not us but the United Nations that suffers loss in China’s not recovering its rights in the United Nations. Here I would like to express my thanks to the many friendly countries, the United Arab Republic (UAR) among them, for supporting us on this issue. The issue of China and the United States will in the end be resolved one day. We have already waited 14 years and can wait another 14 years. Yesterday I heard Your Excellency the President say that in the past Europe’s Crusader army occupied Jerusalem for a period of 17 years. We still have three years to go. (Nasser interrupted to say that it was not 17 years, but 70 years.) Not resolving the issue of China and the United States in no way impedes us from implementing with other countries a policy of peaceful coexistence and friendship.The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are the basic principles of our country’s association with the countries of Africa, Asia, Latin America, and even the West. In Europe, we have diplomatic relations with such countries as Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark, and Norway. We believe that such relations will also expand. At present our country has already established diplomatic relations with over 40 other countries, and this will develop in the future. The number of countries that have trade and cultural relations with our country approaches one hundred. Other than the Union of South Africa and Israel, we have friendly relations with the peoples of countries throughout the world. A US labor delegation has already visited China. The US writer Strong and other US friends are still living in China. In the area of international activities, other than the United Nations, we have also created many other ways and means of international activities.   China by no means opposes the good principles of the UN Charter. There are representatives of the Chinese Communist Party who in the past participated as China’s representatives in the signing of the UN Charter. Chen Jiakang, our ambassador in Cairo, at that time accompanied Dong Biwu, now vice chairman of the People’s Republic of China, and participated in the signing of the Charter. We by no means oppose the UN Charter, and not a single Chinese soldier has ever entered US territory. The United States is so far away from us that we simply have not thought to go there. If we invaded someone else’s home as we pleased, that too would be imperialism. China deeply suffered harm from imperialism. Today, after obtaining independence there are so many things that we must do within our country that we simply cannot go invade other people. The issue is that the United States has violated the UN Charter and forcibly occupied our country’s territory, Taiwan. As for those persons who say that China is bellicose and expansionist, this is utterly without foundation. At present the US military is deployed in dozens of countries around the world, with several thousand military bases and over one million troops stationed outside the country. Next year’s US military budget already tops 100 billion dollars. The United States on the one hand calls on the Soviet Union to join in looking for a way to reduce arms but, on the other hand, Johnson asks in testimony before Congress for an increase in the number of military personnel. The United States on the one hand calls for arms reduction while in reality expanding its military. The United States also has been waging special war in South Vietnam. In short, I have a thousand accusations to levy against the United States, which has not one to count against us. If they were to say that there is one, then that would be the Korean War, which they lost. But that is because, first, the United States occupied the Chinese territory of Taiwan and, second, the United States did not listen to our warning.In 1954, Eden said to me at the Geneva Conference that the United States was unhappy with China because China beat the United States in Korea. China suffers the encirclement and hostility of the United States, so the people of New China cannot but oppose the United States. But we say again that we are friends of the people of the United States. We must make a distinction between the government and the people of the United States.At present the United States seeks hegemony over the entire world, an ambition which Britain, France, and other countries do not have. Such policies as Dulles’ brinkmanship and Kennedy’s New Frontier illustrate this issue. Against socialist countries, the United States engages in peaceful evolution. Kennedy in comparison to Eisenhower is more cunning and has an even more reactionary policy of double dealing. He speaks on the one hand of peace, and on the other he speaks of the status of power. It was precisely because the United States has powerful groups that did not permit him to engage in double dealing that they got rid of him in the end. Kennedy was reactionary, but a revolutionary people opposes assassination. Your film “Saladin,” too, calls for a contest of arms, not schemes and intrigues.The United States throughout the whole world is overbearing, and an absolute majority of countries have diplomatic relations with the United States. Other than those countries that follow the United States, other countries must take into consideration relations with the United States. But China and the United States do not have diplomatic relations, nor has China joined the United Nations. Therefore, it is good for China to make clear to the people of the world the bad things that the United States does. We can speak freely. We believe that although the Chinese and US sides are still negotiating, the time has not yet come for a real resolution of the issue. It is not a simple thing for the United States to change its policy. Kennedy only wanted to make some changes in its methods, resulting in his assassination, which is proof of this.Relations between China and the United States are not good. Will it make the whole world uneasy? It will not. This is because we do not want to start a war. The United States, if it starts a war, will become bogged down in it. Preparing for global war would be bad for the United States. Our country advocates peace talks to resolve conflicts and opposes resorting to military force. But if the other side insists on imposing war on us, we, too, will prepare to face the attack, meet it, and prepare to go on fighting. This way, the United States then has to consider China’s attitude. For “tiny, tiny” Cuba, once Premier Castro announces that Cuba will fight to the last man, the United States then has to think it over. The United States bullies the weak and fears the strong. If you are weak, it will bully you all the more. We have learned this from your side. You rejected Eisenhower-ism, and he was at a complete loss as to what to do. So it was, too, with the Suez Canal Incident and the US and British military occupation of Lebanon and Jordan.I previously met and spoke with Premier Sabri with regard to the Sino-Indian border issue and now will again say a few words.India does not want to negotiate now. There are those who say that if China completely accepted the proposals of the Colombo countries, then India would want to negotiate. We must answer this issue from two aspects. First, if so, it would be the same as requiring China to recognize the Colombo resolution as a ruling. I think that on this point all the Colombo countries do not think this. Our country in principle accepts the Colombo Conference proposals as the basis of negotiations, but actual action far surpasses the proposals’ requirements. We advocate that when the time comes both sides negotiate in putting their requirements and viewpoints on the table but should not put forth preconditions. Second, if the two sides are not sincere, even if they sit down at the table to talk, the negotiations will still break down. If the negotiations were to break down, if would be better not to have talked. Because negotiations between China and India are not the same as those between China and the United States, negotiations require a resolution of the issue. Were the talks to take place and break drown, the situation and impact would be worse than now.There is a basis to my saying that India does not want to negotiate. There are two things that can serve as evidence. The first is from 1960, when a small clash took place on the Sino-Indian border. At the time we took the initiative to propose that the premiers of China and India meet to resolve the border issue. I also said that, if it were inconvenient for the Indian premier to go to Beijing, I was willing to go to Delhi. I proposed negotiations at the time mainly in seeing the border issue between China and Burma resolved. There was then no reason that the Sino-Indian border issue could not have been resolved through peace talks. This is because the McMahon Line was not only drawn between China and India but between China and Burma as well. As China and Burma did not recognize the McMahon Line but the two sides resolved the border issue between them according to the actual situation, then the Sino-Indian border issue, too, should be resolved.In April we left Delhi, but the talks were without result. We even intended to propose several points in common as a basis for future negotiations. India refused, but these points in common were ones that India’s premier had previously accepted.India’s attitude is: for the eastern border, we must accept the McMahon line; for the western border, India wants it where it has never been, an area where Chinese have been living for several hundred years and made their own. In regard to these issues, in the past I visited India three times: in 1954, 1956, and 1957. They never put forth proposals. Naturally, this left China no way to accept it. This shows that in 1960 I was sincere in my visit but did not resolve the issue.The second thing was at the time of the July 1962, Geneva Conference when Marshall Chen Yi, representing China's policy, met Indian Defense Minister Menon. At that time, in a situation where both sides were prepared to settle through discussion in maintaining the border status quo (both the eastern and western border were more to India’s advantage at that time than at present) and hold talks without conditions to resolve the issue. Pan Zili, our ambassador to India, as he was returning to China at the end of his assignment paid a farewell call on Nehru, who expressed a willingness to have talks. At the time we assumed that the Indian side could accept a negotiated agreement reached with us on the basis of maintaining the border status quo. But unexpectedly Menon wanted our side first to demarcate several areas to give to him, commit them in advance, and then hold talks again. Because of this, the two sides did not come to an agreement. That meeting gave Menon the illusion that if India occupied Chinese territory stronghold by stronghold, China would not resist. Indeed, in order to avoid a clash, for about half a year we did not fight back when Indian forces attacked us. But each time we gave them a warning, demanding that they stop their advance. But India did not listen. In October last year, the Indian side even more openly declared that they would drive out all Chinese forces from China’s territory. The whole world saw the Indian prime minister’s statement and the defense minister’s mobilization orders. For this India then appointed a new military chief of staff. After that, only when our country was in an intolerable situation did we then carry out a counterattack in self-defense against the Indian army’s invasion.The two things mentioned above both explain that there were quite good opportunities for negotiation, but that India did not want to accept them. The present situation, by comparison to that before, has naturally become much more difficult.Asking China to accept completely the Colombo Conference proposals would be the same as demanding that we surrender completely. How could we do this? Does not India propose that both sides have honorable and dignified negotiations? How can one ask China to participate completely without honor in a meeting?! To show consideration for only one side and not the other is wrong. We have never made any demands but only asked to resolve the issue through meeting and negotiation. We think that now is not yet the opportune time for the two sides to negotiate. Rather than negotiate and break off negotiations, it would be better not to negotiate. We have made many concessions in consideration of India’s difficulties. When India says that they will not go to China, we can go to India. We have never cancelled this promise. If the location for the negotiations were some neutral country, that, too, naturally would be fine.  What is the outlook for the Sino-Indian border conflict? Frankly speaking, all is well for now. Since our side has taken the initiative of a cease-fire and such mitigation measures as initiating a withdrawal of 20 kilometers along the entire front line, there will be no conflict between the two sides if the Indian army does not again enter our actual line of control.Our side released all the Indian military prisoners, tended to the wounds of the wounded, and even sent back some of the captured weapons. We even returned some new ones shipped from the United States and still in their boxes. Our side does not want conflict and, naturally, will not engage in provocation.We have not only adopted the aforementioned measures but, in order to handle new provocations that the Indian side could start, we hereafter prepare to take steps on the basis of the following three types of situation:(1) If only a small number of Indian soldiers invaded our side’s area of control, then left again after coming, we would give a warning, make note of it, and each quarter inform the Colombo conference countries of the situation.(2) If India did not leave after invading our side’s area, we would give that side a warning, demand their withdrawal, immediately inform the Colombo Conference countries of the situation, and try to persuade India to go back. The situation would be over when the Indian army withdrew.(3) If India refused to withdraw, only then would we exercise the right to self-defense.The present situation is quite different from what it was in October last year. Previously there were only the notes and contacts of the two sides. Other countries were not involved. It did not attract much attention. As a result, fighting started.At present there are the three methods of response that I have mentioned. The Colombo countries can play an important mediating role.After 1840, every imperialist country, including even smallest Portugal, all had power in China, concluding with China every kind of unequal treaty. After the establishment of New China, our attitude in regard to the treaties is this: on the one hand we point out that these are all unequal treaties and, on the other hand we also point out that they are a fact of history. Naturally, we cannot recognize secret treaties concluded with local governments. If a border already has an old treaty, we strive to conclude a new one to replace the old one. If there is no treaty, then we strive to conclude a border treaty. On the basis of the principles of peace, friendship, and give-and-take, our country has concluded border treaties with such countries as Burma, Nepal, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Mongolia. With Korea and Vietnam, although they are still not unified and we have not signed treaties, we also have agreement in principle with them. In the treaty signed with Pakistan, we have also provided an explanation in regard to the issue of Kashmir. Everyone knows from reading the newspapers that in the past there was conflict over the Sino-Soviet border. Now both sides have agreed on holding border talks in February next year. The issue will be resolved. What remains unresolved has to do with only one country, India. We are also fully confident in this regard, believing that in the end the issue will be resolved one day.   Will it cause new border conflicts? As I see it, at present this does not seem likely. India’s government rebukes us for massing troops at the border, saying that China’s air force has invaded Indian airspace. We declare each time that there is no such thing, but India still frequently raises this. But India has recently lost its credibility. The United States knows that there is no such thing, as does the Soviet Union. Because the United States has military bases in Thailand, as well as military organs in India and Pakistan, if we massed troops in Tibet, they would be able to detect it from the air.The U-2 aircraft of the United States fly not only from Taiwan to the Chinese mainland, but they take off from SEATO as well. Tibet is not only vast in area and sparse in population, but also unsuitable for the large-scale massing of troops. Last year, only in a situation where there was no solution, did we then mass some troops. Once there was a ceasefire, those troops were then removed at once. Nor do we have a powerful air force in Tibet. The United States and the Soviet Union both know this. We have shot down two US U-2aircraft, obtaining many photographs, which shows that they know of it. In 1960I also spoke of this to Prime Minister Nehru, and to Burma’s U Nu and Ne Win as well, asking them to shoot down invading aircraft of unknown nationality and see just who they are. The result was that General Ne Win shot down an aircraft and, as expected, found that it was one of Chiang Kai-shek’s aircraft. I requested that India also give it a try, but Nehru did not believe it. I had expected them to say: your aircraft are too high to shoot down. As expected, later India’s defense minister said such a thing. In fact our country does not have such high-altitude aircraft. We do not have U-2 aircraft. Many countries also know this. I told them, if you keep squabbling over trivial points, we will not respond as it would be meaningless! In the future we will only give a general reply. The day before I left Beijing this time, I met India’s diplomatic representative and requested that he pass on to India’s foreign ministry our request that they not engage in such a battle of diplomatic notes, as they would lose credibility. Indeed, neither the US government nor Britain’s General Staff believe it.There are those who say that China and India cannot rely on negotiations to resolve the issue and that India will rely more on imperialist military aid. I recognize this fact. The issue is not that India only asked for aid due to tension between China and India, but that in India there are some people who feel happy to obtain aid and to fabricate rumors in order to obtain aid. At present India on the one hand takes money and arms from the United States and Britain while at the same time also obtaining aid from the Soviet Union. I worry about India because of this, as this is not good for India. It is also doubtful whether one can build an army this way. At the time of the Bandung Conference, the premiers of Thailand and Pakistan both told me that US military aid makes the domestic deficit grow day by day. They also said that the military equipment is second and third rate, comes with particularly few bullets, and is not easily replenished in a fight. There will come a day when India will feel that doing this will bring down India. Doing this also will increase the people’s dissatisfaction in India. If India’s government early would become aware of this and resolve the issue through peace talks, then that naturally would be good. But it certainly is not likely. It is like someone who smokes opium and becomes addicted, resulting in his only hurting himself. At present it is also said that India is a non-aligned country. That is ridiculous. India’s press and international opinion both have openly discussed and recognized this matter.Will the six countries of the Colombo Conference meet again? This is up to the six countries of the Colombo Conference themselves. I know that there is not now a unanimous view on whether or not to hold a meeting of the six countries. President Nkrumah, apparently, is a bit more interested. We occupy the status of mediator, which is not saying that we endorse or oppose it. If all six countries stand for it, we endorse it. But we have only one request. When the time comes, the parties involved on the Chinese and Indian sides should have persons attend the conference and speak more clearly there on the issue. We think that we are right and have no fear in regard to the conference. As we are willing to meet, we have the sincerity to resolve the issue. All that is required is to have an opportunity to meet, and there is always the possibility of obtaining some result. If the six countries feel that the time is ripe and the Indian side agrees, then we also will agree, whether or not the meeting is formal or not. We have always supported any effort to restore friendship and reconciliation. We believe that the six nations will certainly be able to adopt a genuine attitude of promoting friendship and reconciliation and solve the problem without increasing tensions. I am fully confident about this. As for discrepancies on specific issues and views, they often exist and can be resolved.Last, we hope that relations between China and India ease a bit. Your ambassador in Beijing can affirm that each time that I have spoken I have expressed my desire for negotiations and a peaceful resolution of the conflict. Nowhere have we spoken against India’s government. But India’s premier and ministers have spoken countless times in parliament or in the press, attacking China and setting off war hysteria within the country. In Delhi, for example, the atmosphere is not at all the same as that in Beijing or Shanghai. If we compare public opinion in both countries, the issue is clearly visible. Asian and African countries should get along with one another in peace and friendship, different from the relations between us and imperialism. Japan in the past invaded China. We are now willing to improve relations with Japan. Why would we want to make trouble with India?! With regard to this issue, tomorrow if we have time, I would like again to exchange views with Your Excellency the President.Now I will discuss again with Your Excellency the President some of my views on the Non-Aligned Conference and the Asian-African Conference.With regard to the Non-Aligned Conference: I sent a telegram expressing support to the First Non-Aligned Conference. This situation will be more complicated. First of all, there is the issue of whether India really is a non-aligned country. Second, to safeguard peace we must oppose whoever wrecks the peace and oppose whoever is making war. Once again, if India participates, whether India will agree to oppose imperialist wars of aggression is also worthy of skepticism. As for whether the Non-Aligned Conference will discuss the issue of China and India, I believe it will not. China is an aligned country and we will not ask to participate in the conference. There is some public opinion that says that China is thinking to fight to participate, but this is a misunderstanding regarding us. As the conference will not have China as a participant, I believe that there will be no discussion of an issue concerning China. I will not worry about this issue. The conference is Your Excellency the President’s initiative. I believe that Your Excellency clearly understands China’s position.In regard to the conference we will not oppose it, as it is an issue per se of the Non-Aligned Countries, but nor will we adopt a positive attitude. Imperialism will not be happy about the conference and will exploit it by means of some countries. This point is of concern to us. We believe, however, that most countries that participate in the conference will deal with this situation. As for the Second Asian-African Conference, it was raised earlier than the Non-Aligned Conference. The results of the First Bandung Conference surpassed the original forecast. The Bandung Principles were adopted under the auspices of Your Excellency the President, and the UAR has a greater responsibility to maintain and promote these principles. Some independent countries in Africa are greatly influenced by the Bandung principles. As Your Excellency the President said, the preparatory meeting for the Second Asian-African Conference indeed encountered difficulties, but any conference has its difficulties. For example, there were various groupings of countries attending the African Summit Conference, but through the efforts of Your Excellency the President as well as the leaders of other countries, barriers were eliminated and first steps were taken to achieve solidarity. It was a good start. So it was with the First Non-Aligned Conference. The countries attending the conference also had different ideas on how to view the issues. There are indeed difficulties in holding the Second Asian-African Conference. There are conflicts between not a few countries but, as long as they have strong confidence and imperialism does not participate, everyone will find points in common, eliminate difficulties, and make the conference a success. At the time of the First Asian-African Conference, there were not many countries that had established diplomatic relations with China and supported China. Everyone was unfamiliar with everyone else. The Philippines, Turkey, Pakistan, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, and other countries had misunderstanding in regard to our country and were unfriendly. However, after coming into contact, they felt that China was not that terrible. Some of the representatives later had a change in attitude. We believe that, so long as the conference can start, we can resolve the issues. I agree that before holding the conference we would have to go through very good preparation, that we cannot act with undue haste, and that there could be unofficial contacts among the participants in advance. We support President Sukarno with regard to his proposal for holding the Second Asian-African Conference. Your Excellency the President has also expressed support. If we fully carry out the advance preparatory work, it will be beneficial in facilitating holding and concluding the conference. A regional conference firmly opposes imperialism, safeguards peace, maintains national independence, and adheres to the UN Charter. This is all just and honorable.Naturally, the Second Asian-African Conference still has some specific issues, such as that of economic cooperation, which require discussions to resolve. Economic exchanges between Asian and African countries and those with imperialism receive very unequal treatment. Relations of economic cooperation between Asian and African countries should be built on the basis of equality and mutual benefit for everyone’s benefit in common. In common we have suffered backwardness and desire to cast it off. We need to be sympathetic and supportive of one another. We need to help each other, not hurt each other. We need to respect each other’s sovereignty, not impose ourselves on others, let alone interfere in the affairs of other countries and harm others for our own benefit. The Second Asian-African Conference very much needs to resolve issues of economic, technical, cultural, and scientific cooperation on the basis of the Ten Principles adopted at the first conference.The UAR is now establishing its own national economy. That is the impression we have gained after the presentations of Premier Sabri and Council Member Rifaat and our tours. The UAR’s economy is growing more each day. We emphasize collective cooperation among the countries of Asia and Africa, but we do not exclude mutual cooperation among two or three countries. In this respect, China may be able to make a little effort, but it would be quite limited. The reason is that China has not been liberated for a long time. To date we have only carried out two five-year plans. Moreover, the country is large, and casting off backwardness requires more strength. The Second Five-Year Plan mainly relies on ourselves to solve difficulties. We have already solved not a few difficulties, but there still remain not a few. In such a situation, what we can contribute today to Asian and African countries remains limited, which is not very suitable with the status of a great power. We hope to cast off our backwardness as soon as possible, and we hope the same for other countries. Asian and African countries help one another. They will be more reliable than the countries of the West.We consider that each Asian and African country should carry out mutual economic aid as follows: First, one offers what one can offer. Second, this kind of help should be appropriate to the needs of others. One cannot impose it on people. That is to say, it should be beneficial to the development of the national economy of other countries, not make others into a dependent economy, should be able to use their own materials, produce their own equipment and tools, and expand reproduction.It should also be of benefit to others in quickly being able to regain capital, satisfy the needs of the people, and facilitate the accumulation of capital. In short, help cannot burden others but should promote their development. Help is best that is free of interest, with debt repayment coming after economic development. If not, it would increase the burden on others in order to repay the debt. It is the same for learning from one another, which is learning from one another and not only one side learning from the other. If there are specialists and technicians from one side who go to the other, their treatment should be the same as that of the people of the receiving country and the sending country should take care of their family members. Technical information should be exchanged to promote everyone’s joint development. Naturally, this kind of exchange does not include obtaining things from other countries but is limited to what is within one’s own country’s grasp. Goods and equipment all should be exchanged at equal value. The above are the principles of economic cooperation with Asian and African countries. Sending people to other countries is to serve the people. Once finished, they should return and leave the technical personnel of other people able to grow quickly.We have seen a new look in the UAR’s level of industry, and your level of technology has shown great improvement. Saying that you would like us to give you some help would be to overestimate our capabilities but, after exchanging views with Premier Sabri and obtaining his encouragement, we feel that, starting next year, we first of all must make efforts to have the trade volume of our two countries to meet the amount of 27 million pounds sterling, expanding trade in non-traditional goods. Then we would increasingly expand our trade volume. Before the Suez Canal, the foreign exchange differential that our side provided was a bit larger. Owing to difficulties of ours, in the last year or two the figure has become smaller. This year’s figure is only one million pounds sterling. We will strive for a somewhat larger differential next year, expanding it to 1.5 to 2 million pounds sterling.In the area of economic cooperation, we also would like to offer some contribution, but the figure would be extremely limited and insignificant. If the UAR should feel the need, we could provide help in the area of equipment and materials. This kind of help would be according to the principle that I just mentioned. The figure would be 50 million dollars.Our two countries can greatly develop cultural cooperation. We hope that next year the UAR’s song and dance troupe will visit our country. We also will prepare to send many students to the UAR to study Arabic and the strong points of your science and technology.In regard to the science festival, I see your promotion of science, and this is very important. Whether it is social revolution or natural revolution, both require mastering science. I feel that you already have grasped this important link. Making use of a scientific attitude in educating the next generation is quite important, because the revolutionary cause is developing. Our generation cannot complete it. We must rely on the next generation to do so.What I have said just is what I wanted to say today, but I have spoken a bit too much.Nasser: I thank Your Excellency the Premier for giving me an introduction to the international situation and the situation in Southeast Asia. People tend to worry more about their own problems but little notice those of other areas. Such an introduction is very good for us.Since our meeting in 1955, we have all this time watched the development of China’s state of affairs and Taiwan’s state of affairs. Until now, we have only understood China from US newspapers and magazines. Since Bandung, our relations have made great progress. When we met in Bandung, there was also one of Chiang Kai-shek’s ambassadors residing there. In May 1956, we recognized China. Before then, when a cultural delegation led by Bao Erhan [Burhan Shahidi] came, I told him that we would make an appropriate decision on the issue of recognizing China.On the issue of Taiwan, we support you. We understand the issue of two Chinas and understand your desire to maintain territorial integrity. Two months ago your ambassador proposed to me that he feared we supported the position of two Chinas. This information is not true. We completely understand your position and support your point of view.Once the conflict between China and India started, I hoped that China and India could once more come together in solidarity. Unfortunately, much to my surprise, on 8 September conflict broke out. I immediately attempted to offer good offices. I was recently attacked in the press, which said that the Non-Aligned Countries should support one another and rebuked me for recently having refused to offer support. At that time, we agreed to India’s request that we provide India a few light weapons, a few submachine guns. This might have made you unhappy. At that time the ambassador called on me, and I explained it to him. A few light weapons cannot influence a war between the two sides. So, our provision of light weapons was to have India not turn to the West for weapons. Then Britain agreed to provide weapons to India, so we have not carried out our original arrangement with India. We are genuinely concerned about the future of India’s non-aligned policy. Indian National Congress members, the press, and influential organizations have all opposed India’s implementation of a Non-Aligned policy. I discussed this point with your vice minister and ambassador. Imperialism has always tried to exploit the tensions of Asian and African countries, such as the issues of Kashmir, Israel, and the Somali-Ethiopian border. Having suffered military failure and retreated, India believes that this is India’s shame. If there are to be negotiations, India cannot again negotiate in a weakened position but must negotiate from a position of strength. This will require strengthening the army, and strengthening the army will require depending on foreign aid. This is not something that can be settled in several months but will require several years. The present issue is whether the situation will be able to ease for several years. Otherwise, it will affect Asian solidarity and that of Asia and Africa. I very much appreciate the precautionary measures that Your Excellency mentioned just now. We are thinking of how to help resolve this issue. Even if the armistice can be maintained for several years, what do we do after several years? The Colombo countries if they meet again will have no new issues to discuss. If India does not agree to negotiations, then neither will it agree to attend the conference. Nehru has already spoken of this in parliament. We will do our utmost to offer our good offices, bring both sides together, and resolve the issue. India attacks China, and the West takes advantage of it. This is harmful to Asian solidarity.The Non-Aligned Conference will certainly mention new and old imperialism. The First Non-Aligned Conference raised the issue, and the African Summit Conference also raised it. It is for sure that, there will be no Non-Aligned Conference without mention of new and old imperialism. Should China not participate in the conference, the conference will not condemn China and support India on the conflict between China and India. Based on my contacts with all parties, with the exception of one or two countries none would agree to a discussion of the Sino-Indian border issue. Perhaps the conference would express its hope that China and India peacefully resolve the conflict. This formula would of course be reasonable. The conflict between China and India is not like the West Irian issue, as the other side to the West Irian issue is imperialism. Should China not participate, the conference certainly will not condemn China. Your Excellency the Premier may rest assured. There is no need to worry about this.Zhou: I am convinced that you will not condemn China. My concern lies elsewhere.Nasser: We discussed in our previous meeting the Asian-African Conference. We approve of actively carrying out the preparatory work, in particular of having India able to participate. If India does not participate, it would be a great loss for Asian solidarity. Today I saw in the newspaper Subandrio’s statement about preparing to hold a preparatory meeting in February next year. But he has yet to make formal contact with us. In short, we feel that holding this meeting would be useful. The important thing is first to carry out well the preparatory work. The Bandung Conference was prepared well and without reference to the issue of Kashmir. In preparing well in advance and reaching agreement, the conference will certainly be very successful.Your Excellency spoke of the issue of economic and cultural cooperation between our two countries. We completely agree. Your Excellency spoke of the issue of collective and bilateral cooperation among newly emerging countries. Again, we completely agree. As for strengthening economic cooperation between our two countries, I greatly appreciate such issues as your providing us loans and machinery. Alexandria has a textile factory with machinery that China has supplied. Later we can find out which machines can be imported from China, then ask again for China’s help. We should change the traditional trading of goods for cotton and add new content to it.I want again to emphasize that we welcome this visit of Your Excellency and your colleagues. This visit has provided a good opportunity to strengthen our friendship.Zhou: It is Premier Sabri who handled the start. I asked him several times to go, he did, and the result has been good.Nasser: Hereafter, too, we should continue strengthening exchanges between the leaders of our countries.Zhou: President Liu Shaoqi requests that Your Excellency visit China on a future tour of Asia.Nasser: I would be very happy to go.Our people are very interested in politics. They pay great attention to China’s development and China’s revolution, and have been paying more attention in particular since the Bandung Conference.Zhou: In the last several days, we have gained a deep impression. Thank you for being such hospitable hosts. In particular there was Mr. Farid, who showed his mastery of the scientific method. The schedule was well planned. In six days we came into contact with every field. The organizational work was well done.Nasser: These six days have passed very quickly.Zhou: We learned a great many things.Nasser: We also agree on strengthening cultural cooperation. Our education minister visited China not long ago. We would welcome more Chinese students coming to the UAR.Zhou: This third meeting was very useful. Many of the views on the issues are identical. We can express them in the communique. The film “Saladin” is very good and should be introduced to Chinese audiences. Later we can translate the dialogue into Chinese.(Conventional remarks exchanged at conclusion of meeting omitted）[…] [Ellipsis in original] \n",

      "On December 12-14th, the premier of the DPRK paid a state visit to Dacca. According to the information provided by the Korean ambassador, they had originally planned to send a party and government delegation in 1982, but the BNP [Bangladesh Nationalist Party] did not consider it timely to arrange a meeting of party delegations.The ambassador told us the following:In the field of foreign policy, particular emphasis was laid on the Non-Aligned Movement. [The Bangladeshi side] expressed the view that Bangladesh enthusiastically supported the movement, but they would be more pleased if its center were not Cuba but, for instance, the DPRK, and if its leader were not Fidel Castro but rather Kim Il Sung. [hand-written comment on the margin of the document: ?!]The Bangladeshi leaders are of the opinion that the deterioration of East-West relations was caused by the inappropriate behavior of the socialist countries. They confirmed that in February, President [Abdus] Sattar would travel to India, while the Pakistani president would visit Bangladesh in April. They are going to invite a Korean party delegation for the BNP congress scheduled for January.The Bangladeshi president accepted an invitation to the DPRK for 1982.In the field of domestic politics:They paid special attention to the achievement of economic self-sufficiency in Bangladesh. The DPRK is ready to provide assistance to that by inviting technical experts on a regular basis, for training periods ranging from one month to one year. The Bangladeshi side informed [the North Koreans] that after the presidential elections, the situation had not been finally settled yet; the government would soon undergo a reorganization to make it smaller than the present one.The ambassador is satisfied with the result of the visit.102 – G.  \n",

      "With respect to the secret negotiations which are currently taking place in Panmunjeom between the North Koreans and the Americans on the USS Pueblo military vessel seized by the DPRK on January 23, we would like to inform you about the following matters:The central press agencies released a brief statement revealing that, due to the persistent requests of the Americans, the North Koreans have agreed to enter into talks at Panmunjeom on the USS Pueblo incident.We know that the Koreans are usually extremely calm in their discussions and they are trying to drag their feet as much as possible to extend the length of these talks. One of the signs of the DPRK’s malleability is the fact that on February 6 it returned the bodies of the two USS Pueblo crew members who died during the incident while also expressing its intent to release the two or three wounded members of the crew.As far as we know from what the Press Director of the DPRK Ministry of Foreign Affairs told us on February 6, the Americans are searching for the best possible pretense to excuse themselves in front of the North Korean authorities and international public opinion, putting all the blame on the USS Pueblo commander who ‘lacked the consent of his superiors and, acting upon his own judgment, violated the territorial waters of the DPRK.’The fact that the Americans started their secret talks with the DPRK and that they are strictly discussing the USS Pueblo incident without linking it to the incidents in South Korea (the infiltration from the North on January 21), together with the tendency of the Americans to admit their guilt in one way or another in front of the North Koreans, gave rise in South Korea to the biggest repulsion towards the United States of America in the last twenty years.The South Korean authorities and all parties and organizations in South Korea laid official complaints and openly condemned the meek attitude of the United States, which is manifested in their willingness to enter secret talks with the DPRK on the USS Pueblo incident.Over the last few days, intense anti-American demonstrations have taken place in Seoul and in all urban centers in South Korea, underlining the dissatisfaction with the secret negotiations in Panmunjeom and asking Park Chung Hee’s government to revisit its position vis-à-vis the United States of America (which is discounting South Korea’s ability to pursue its own interests); in order to enhance its self-defense capabilities (given that the United States of America is no longer offering the appropriate guarantees), it was asked to withdraw South Korean troops from South Vietnam, to take serious measures to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future, etc. Under these circumstances, it has become even more obvious why the DPRK is extending its negotiations with the United States as much as possible.The diplomatic corps in Pyongyang believes that the South Koreans are intensifying this anti-American campaign so that after solving the USS Pueblo incident, they will be able to obtain more substantial military aid from the US.We think that irrespective of the means the US will use to draw closer to South Korea, the prestige and reputation of the Americans in the eyes of the South Korean people has been seriously undermined. In this respect, we take into account the fact that the United States accepted to sit down and talk to the DPRK, to whom they will apologize, as well as the fact that the majority of the infiltrations from the North are being carried out through the perimeter guarded by the American Second division, which has generated a lot of mistrust in the way the US is ensuring South Korea’s security.Due to the instability, confusion, and dwindling trust of the support offered by the US, South Korea adopted a series of serious measures to strengthen its self-defense capabilities. Thus, President Park Chung Hee ordered the mobilization of 2.5 million people on February 7, pausing all retirements in the armed forces and creating armed self-defense units (troops) in every large village.\n",

      "At the airport, before the arrival of Polish Deputy Foreign Minister [Tadeusz] Olechowski, General Director of  Political Affairs Munawir told us the following about the discussions held in the course of DPRK Deputy Foreign Minister Kim’s [sic] working visit in Indonesia (February 3-5th):   North Korea asked for Indonesia’s support with regard to two issues:The issue of Korean reunification be placed on the agenda of the summit [of the Non-Aligned Movement] in New Delhi, and this subject be included in the final statement (political declaration) in accordance with the North Korean approach.The next summit of the non-aligned countries be held in Pyongyang.To the first issue, [the Indonesians] replied that this problem was a domestic affair of the two Koreas, and they should solve it through negotiations. Munawir added that the fulfillment of this request would be difficult anyway, because the Korean question was deleted from the agenda of the first summit.On the second issue, they evaded making a standpoint by saying that if the right to organize the next summit was also given to an Asian country, then it would be unfair to deny Iraq, which had already made great financial sacrifices to arrange the present summit, this opportunity. The aforesaid result of the visit is remarkable, all the more so because one purpose of Kim’s visit was to make preparations for Vice-President [Adam] Malik’s trip to Pyongyang, which started on February 7th. Taking the close Indonesian-South Korean cooperation into consideration, it cannot be expected that Indonesia will make concessions to the DPRK at the expense of South Korea. Therefore, Malik’s visit is regarded as a goodwill visit, rather than [a political one]. Still, the Soviet ambassador does not exclude the possibility that during the visit, Indonesian-Chinese contacts might be made in Pyongyang. Malik has the reputation of being a firm advocate of the normalization of Indonesian-Chinese relations.19 – D.\n",

In this respect, the DPRK invited a Central African delegation to Pyongyang to finish the last details of a wide-ranging economic cooperation project (aimed at modernizing the agriculture through irrigations, giving out credits, [offering] specialists and agricultural equipment, civil engineering, etc.).

      "In the view of General Smoldas, the head of the Czechoslovak delegation in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Panmunjom, the spy ship incident that occurred on February 15 is more advantageous to Park Chung Hee than to the North. In the recent months, Park Chung Hee’s political position has become more unstable. He could expect a rift within the establishment. By launching a massive campaign over the incident and appealing to the emotions [of the South Korean population], Park Chung Hee might be able to achieve a temporary re-stabilization of his rule.Both sides are interested in keeping the tension alive, but, in the view of Smoldas, the northerners made a great tactical mistake when they got involved in the incident in such a political situation that was more advantageous to them [than to Park Chung Hee]. The general also considers it possible that the incident occurred by accident, in the sense that the commander of the northern ship might have lost self-control, and presumably opened fire at the spy ships disguised as fishing boats at a time when they were still on the high seas.

      "(Top Secret)Minutes of Conversation between Premier Zhou and Ambassador Pavel Yudin, 20:00 4 January 1955Ambassador Pavel Yudin stated: Prior to leaving New York, United Nations Secretary General [Dag Hjalmar Agne Carl] Hammarskjold once had a conversation with United Nations head secretary assistant Comrade Chernov [sic] (Soviet personnel). Now Comrade [Vyacheslav] Molotov is telling Premier Zhou the main points of the conversation between Comrade Chernov and [Dag] Hammarskjold. Comrade Molotov said that the reason why [Dag] Hammarskjold told Chernov the purpose of his visit to Beijing is because he knows that the conversation content will be passed on to Beijing.The following is the telegram text from Moscow:Our comrade Chernov, who is assistant to the head secretary of the United Nations, once had a conversation with [Dag] Hammarskjold prior to his trip to Beijing. Hammarskjold initiated to copiously explain the purpose of his trip to Beijing. The main content of what was said can be [text illegible] as follows:He believes that under the current conditions of the United Nations, that is to say the condition of having no consensus between countries in the [United Nations] Security Council with the [text illegible] majority on one hand and the [text illegible] on the other hand; the United Nations Secretary General plays a decisive and independent role. As Secretary General, he cannot simply act as the enforcer of resolutions passed by the majority in the United Nations General Assembly. [Dag] Hammarskjold does not intend to enforce [text illegible], because this policy can only reflect the interests of the majority and is detrimental to the interests of the minority. In addition this does not help in solidifying and maintaining peace. Therefore, today he will eagerly enforce this policy that is possibly not in accord with the majority; however this will be in the direction towards the easing of the tense international situation. He asked me (Chernov), is the “philosophy” that he had just described correct? I (Chernov) answered: according to me it is correct. At the same time, I added a line: In the past [Trygve] Lie (the former United Nations Secretary General) held the other kind of understanding and we all know the outcome that he received.[Dag] Hammarskjold claimed that there is a great difference between his direction and the direction of the former Secretary General. At that time he did not agree with [Trygve] Lie’s policy, and will never [text illegible] [Trygve] Lie’s policies. [Dag] Hammarskjold said, it is because of his own view of what the role of Secretary General is that he decided to intervene in the case of the American pilots. According to him because of this case, the abnormal relationship between China and the United States became even more tense; this helps to resolve the issue of China’s admission into the United Nations. It seems that [Dag] Hammarskjold’s trip to Beijing to meet with Zhou Enlai is due to his own decision. According to him, even if the United Nations General Assembly does not pass a resolution agreeing to allow the Secretary General to handle the case of the American pilots, he will still make this trip. It seems that for this reason he did not send that United Nations resolution to the Beijing government. [Dag] Hammarskjold seems to understand the difficulty and intricacy of his duty quite well, and he very rarely holds optimistic views. He wrote down the three possible outcomes of his trip to Beijing: (1) After a series of considerations by Zhou Enlai, including the interests of China’s internal politics, [Zhou Enlai] never intended to discuss the issue of the pilots. [Dag] Hammarskjold’s plan completely fails and it becomes a huge blow to his credibility of attempting to become a Secretary General that enforces policies in the interest of the United Nations and the whole world.(2) Zhou Enlai discusses the issue of the pilots but at the same time he produces judicial and other materials to show the crime of the pilots. If this is the case then [Dag] Hammarskjold says he seems to have all the evidence required for a rebuttal. This would be (A) All the pilots were shot down within the borders of Korea. (B) All the pilots wore military uniform, and none of them speaks Chinese; this point alone is sufficient to prove that they did not come to China to conduct espionage activities. (C) They all once fought on the side of the United Nations (Dag Hammarskjold once attempted to explain that he does not agree nor does he intend to defend the views of the majority of the countries which is that the [Korean] war was conducted by the United Nations. Regardless of whether or not he doubts this view, from a legal perspective the truth is such [that the pilots fought for the United Nations]. (D) All the equipment on the aircraft seems to show that the plane was attempting to accomplish purely military missions.(3) Zhou Enlai might express willingness to seek some kind of political resolution for the pilot issue. This kind of case, even if it is impossible to reach agreements on all issues, will allow the United Nations Secretary General to feel satisfied. This is because he never intended to conduct negotiations on purely legal grounds, [legal arguments] seems to be for usage as a last resort. [Dag] Hammarskjold hopes that Zhou Enlai, as a genuine national actor, will definitely walk the political path. Although perhaps this meeting will not yield any results, but it will not nail the door shut either; this is convenient for future diplomatic negotiations. [Dag] Hammarskjold believes that if he can receive that kind of result then it would be greatly beneficial regardless of if it is beneficial towards China or beneficial towards the common work of easing the tense international situation. Therefore, [Dag] Hammarskjold viewed Zhou Enlai’s reply to his telegram in that view; he believes [Zhou Enlai’s] reply is a positive sign and hopes that great benefits will arise in the future from personal interactions with Zhou Enlai.Finally, [Dag] Hammarskjold said, he plans to stay in Beijing for four or five days followed by a trip to Tokyo; and then he will proceed to San Francisco via Honolulu. We believe [Dag] Hammarskjold told Chernov these things because he wants the government of the People’s Republic of China to know these things.” Other than the above, Ambassador [Pavel] Yudin also told Premier Zhou the following, which is: Na-lan-ya [sic] (Indian) who is a section head of the United Nations Security Council from some Asian country once said: The Americans are pressuring [Dag] Hammarskjold to not bring any Indians when he goes to Beijing. [Dag] Hammarskjold once expressed that he wants to bring Indian ambassador [text illegible]. [Dag] Hammarskjold once mentioned the request to the Indian government but India refused his request and said that any official personnel from India can not participate in this trip [to Beijing]. Na-lan-ya believes that [Dag] Hammarskjold’s plan to travel to Beijing was issued by the Americans.\n",

There are cases among the population of displays of discontent at the existing situation which cannot be ignored, especially in view of the fact that it is necessary to achieve progress in the economic and cultural development of the DPRK which is convincing to all the Korean people (including South Korea). The situation in the Korean People's Army is bad. Military discipline has declined as a result of a slackening of political work in the Army and there is a lessening of political vigilance. There are cases of treason, desertion, and other crimes both among enlisted men and officers.The principles of collective leadership in the Worker's Party, Party democracy, criticism and self-criticism are being poorly implemented. Elections to the Supreme People's Assembly and local governing bodies have been delayed for a long time.The Worker's Party CC still devotes little attention to work in South Korea, and does not have its own organizations or support in mass legal organizations there.We think that it would be advisable to discuss issues with the Korean comrades which have come to a head about the situation in Korea and invite Cde. Kim Il Sung to Moscow in February 1955 together with a group of senior Worker's Party officials for this purpose.We also think it advisable to inform the Chinese friends about this and ask whether they want to express their views about the issues of the economic and political situation in the DPRK and to also find out in what form they might take part in the consultations with the Korean comrades.In this connection we are sending a memo about the situation in the DPRK from Cdes. Kuznetsov, Stepanov, Fedorenko, and Suzdalev. We consider the views described in the memo to be correct.A draft CPSU CC resolution is attached.V. Molotov M. Suslov17 January 1955Nº 83/MAuthenticated: [illegible signature]======================================================Secret Nº __DraftCPSU CC RESOLUTION1. Consider it advisable to invite Cde. Kim Il Sung to Moscow in February 1955 with a group of senior Worker's Party CC officials instead of the previously planned time frame of April-May 1955, and hold a conversation with him in the CC Presidium.2. Recognize it advisable to inform the Chinese friends about our views in connection with the situation in Korea and find out their opinion.Approve the attached draft instructions to Cde. Yudin in Peking.======================================================Secret Nº __PEKINGTO THE SOVIET AMBASSADORVisit Zhou Enlai and report the following to him.Kim Il Sung has expressed a desire to go to Moscow to consult about issues associated with the preparation of the Labor Party program and also in connection with the DPRK five-year development plan which has been worked out, and concerning several other issues.In Moscow they regard this offer favorably and consider it advisable to exchange opinions with the Korean comrades about the situation in Korea.This said, it is intended to discuss the following.Measures to revive and develop industry are being excessively speeded up in the DPRK and accordingly a considerable portion of budget appropriations are being directed at capital construction. High rates have also been adopted with respect to the production cooperation of agriculture. The Korean comrades are intent on putting all peasant farms into cooperatives in the next five or six years, which causes us serious concerns.The fact stands out that in the plans outlined and in the practical implementation of a number of measures the Korean comrades are insufficiently considering the need to carry out urgent measures to improve the population's living conditions which, according to available information, remain difficult. The Korean friends insufficiently take into account that in conditions where the country remains divided, it is especially important to show the entire Korean people, also including the population of South Korea, that in fact great work is being done in North Korea to improve the lives of the broad popular masses and in improving economic and cultural development at the same time. The CC of the Worker's Party devotes little attention to work in South Korea both legal and illegal, and does not have support there in existing legal organizations.In connection with the above it would be desirable to know the views of the CPC CC about the above issues and also about in what form the Chinese comrades could take part in the aforementioned consultations in Moscow.Reports results by telegraph.\n",

      "[The Soviets] are still expecting to discuss primarily economic issues during the visit of Pak Seong-cheol [Pak Song Chol] here […]It causes great difficulty that 1) The DPRK intends to relieve its serious economic situation by not fulfilling its obligations, which were set down in the long-term trade agreement and in the agreement on the exchange of goods this year, with regard to the export of goods that are saleable on non-socialist markets as well, and at the same time it constantly insists on the uninterrupted and punctual fulfillment of Soviet export obligations. By the way, in 1976 the Soviet Union also fulfilled its export obligations, whereas Korean exports, in contrast to an obligation of 216 million rubles, were only 90 million. Since a substantial part of Korean exports is used for provisioning the Soviet Far East, failures in their delivery always cause considerable difficulties, mainly in production (cement, fire-resistant bricks, etc.), because [such goods] cannot be supplied from other sources without substantial delays. The Korean side will probably attempt to convert the deficit resulting from [the under-fulfillments of] 1976 into a Soviet credit.2) The Korean side is strongly opposed to the application of the price policy that is in operation in the COMECON, including the raising of the price of any Soviet export article. In 1976 the Soviet side did not manage to achieve the COMECON price level in its relations with Korea, nor do they expect [to achieve it] in 1977.3) The Korean side constantly announces new demands (in addition to the agreements), and impatiently presses for their fulfillment. They repeatedly and very emphatically urge, at every level, that Soviet shipments of crude oil be increased to two million metric tons per annum (the Soviets suppose that they intend to sell the processed petroleum derivatives in capitalist markets). For reasons of prestige, they ask the Soviet Union to build a nuclear power plant for them (the five-year agreement did not include this either). They disregard the Soviet replies, according to which they [the Soviets] are unable to deliver loss-making articles over the quantity specified in the plan. According to the information available to the Soviets, in [North Korean] domestic propaganda these problems are presented as the causes of the [DPRK’s] economic difficulties (the Soviet Union exploits Korea by raising prices, it refuses to deliver the goods needed for economic development, because it prefers to sell them to the capitalists, etc.).-Marjai-16- \n",

If there was any delay in the [Korean] disembarkation of the delivered goods at the end of the quarter, the Cubans would halt the shipments next in line.

      "To Comrade Constantin Oancea, Deputy Minister,We report an increased interest in starting a dialogue with the South in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea after the Plenum of the Central Committee of the Workers’ Party of Korea in December 1979. The dialogue will lead to a rapprochement between the two sides of Korea and will create favorable conditions for tackling the reunification problem realistically.The Democratic People's Republic of Korea's wish to put an end to the division of the country has been observed during the recent discussions and in the mass media.  The Democratic People's Republic of Korea insists on the fact that \"the unification is a task that can no longer be delayed\" and that \"it's necessary to find and agree on a way\" that will lead to the reunification.After proposing to form a joint team comprised of North and South Koreans to participate in the Olympic Games in Moscow, and reconnecting the direct phone line between Pyongyang and Seoul, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea launched a new ample initiative. Prime Minister Ri Jeong-ok [Li Jong Ok] sent a letter to the prime minister of South Korea. Kim Il sent other letters as the vice-president of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, as the secretary of the Central Committee of the Workers Party of Korea and as the president of the Committee for the Unification of the Country, to other dignitaries in South Korea, including the presidents of the Republican Democratic Party, the New Democratic Party, the Democratic Party for Reunification, the United Socialist Party and the General of Staff of the South Korean Army.By analyzing the contents of the letters we noticed a few elements that are different from the position and the choice of words used before.In this respect, we noticed the use of the official name of the South - the Republic of Korea - as well as the use of the official functions of the recipients. On previous occasions the press and the radio referred to the South as South Korea.The emphasis is put on attracting the recipients in a dialogue and collaboration for solving the Korean problems and excluding any external interference.In the same time, there are no references to the presence of United Nations and United States troops in South Korea and their withdrawal is not requested.In some letters, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea openly admits that there were misunderstandings and a mutual distrust (between North and South Korea) and expresses its desire to leave the past behind and to stop looking for someone to blame. From this point of view, we can also explain why the Democratic People's Republic of Korea avoids criticizing the South Korean authorities.We also noticed a particularly malleable attitude and that the location for the meeting could be any place the South Korean side prefers.An official reply from South Korea to the proposals of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea hasn't been received yet. South Korean radio stations present these proposals as a part of a peaceful offensive of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea that seeks to stop the normalization of the situation in South Korea after the assassination of Park Chung Hee and the coup d'état attempt on December 12, 1979.\n",

      "SECOND MAIN ADMINISTRATION OF THE GENERAL STAFF OF THE SOVIET ARMYCIPHERED TELEGRAM No. 16052Copies: Stalin (2)From BEIJING Received 18 hours 40 minutes29.1.1951EXTREMELY URGENT TTo FILIPPOV [Stalin]At the present time the American troops are trying to attack the regions of the southern bank of the Han River adjacent to Seoul and Incheon [Jemulpo]. Such a situation has developed that our troops are deprived of the possibility of continuing rest and reformation and are forced immediately to begin preparation for the fourth operation. I send you my telegram of 28 January 1951, addressed to Comrade PENG DEHUAI.I ask you to familiarize yourself with it and communicate your opinion about whether this is advisable from the point of view of the international situation:“Comrade PENG DEHUAI!1. I received your telegram of 27 January 1951, 24:00, and your order about preparation for conducting military operations sent to all armies.2. Our troops must immediately conduct preparations for the fourth operation, with the goal of the destruction of 20,000 to 30,000 American and puppet [South Korean] troops and the occupation of the area to the north of the Daejeon-Andong boundary.3. In the course of the preparation for this operation it is necessary to hold Jemulpo, the fortification before the bridge on the south bank of the Han River and the city of Seoul, and also to draw out the main enemy forces to the Suwon-Jemulpo region. After the beginning of the operation the main forces of the North Korean and Chinese troops must break through the enemy's line of defense in the region of Wonju and make attacks in the direction toward Yeongju and Andong.4. The withdrawal of the Chinese and North Korean troops for 15-30 km to the north and the publication of a communication about support for the proposal about a temporary ceasefire is disadvantageous for us, since the enemy precisely wishes to cease military operations only at the time when our troops withdraw some distance to the north and in order that he (the enemy) can blockade the Han River.5. After the conclusion of the fourth operation, it is possible that the enemy will conduct peace negotiations with us regarding a resolution of the Korean question. Conducting negotiations will then be advantageous for China and Korea. However, the enemy at present is calculating to return the fortification before the bridge on the south bank of the Han River, to the south of the line Seoul-Jemulpo and to blockade the Han River, so that Seoul would be under threat of shelling from enemy artillery, so as thereby to force us to cease military operations and begin peace negotiations. In this way the enemy wants to place China and Korea in a disadvantageous position, which we can in no case allow.6. Our troops have not been able to receive reinforcements. Transporting troops is also inadequate. We have a very great difficulty in this regard. However, we are in a position to concentrate the main forces and with a strike in the direction of Wonju-Yeongju destroy a unit of American troops and four to five divisions of South Korean troops.I ask you explain this to a meeting of the high command. This meeting must be completely directed to the preparation of the fourth operation.7. After the Chinese and Korean troops occupy the region to the north of the Daejeon-Andong boundary, they must again make a two to three months long preparation, after which to accomplish the last, fifth, operation of decisive significance. This is advantageous in all respects.8. The ninth army group must in the near future be redeployed to the region of Pyongyang, Seoul, Jemulpo, Suwon for rest and reformation. At the same time they must fulfill the task of defending the given region so as not to give the possibility to enemy troops to land in Jemulpo and Jinnampo [Nampo]. At the time of the fifth operation the given army group must participate in military operations on the western portions of the front.9. At the time of implementing the fourth operation I ask you to think over the question of whether it will be better for the main forces of the Chinese and North Korean troops to divide into two echelons. Troops of each echelon must have a five day dry ration. Troops of the first echelon must make the breakthrough and carry out the pursuit of the enemy to a determined border, and the troops of the second echelon must continue the pursuit of the enemy, so that the operation will continue for 10-12 days and that in this time it will be possible to destroy as many enemy troops as possible.I ask you to communicate your opinion.MAO ZEDONG, 28 January 195119:00.”No. 478.28 January 1951 MAO ZEDONG\n",

      "Nº 336  Nº 1211-1220 3 July 1953 2340At 0330 3 July at the instruction of Zhou Enlai Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Wu Xiuquan came to the Embassy and delivered a draft reply of Kim Il Sung and Peng Dehuai to Clark's letter of 29 June (it is proposed to send the reply to Clark on 5 July), and also a note which describes the PRC government's assessment of the current state of armistice negotiations and measures planned in connection with Clark's letter.We cite the complete text of these documents below:\"The current state of armistice talks and measures in connection with Clarks' letter.The state of the talks. For the past 12 days, when Syngman Rhee released POWs and unleashed a campaign against an armistice, the US , reaching an impasse in the Korean War, primarily engaged in urging Syngman Rhee to cut back his campaign against an armistice and reaching a compromise with him.In order to pacify Syngman Rhee, the Americans are trying to conclude a temporary agreement with him. This would provide an opportunity to sign an armistice agreement and allow the US to get out of the current difficult position. However, Syngman Rhee is seriously trying to draw the Americans into his plans. He cannot be satisfied by the conclusion of a temporary agreement and continues to advance the demand that the political conference be limited to three [Translator's note: the typed word is very faded here, but is probably \"mes.\" (months)], at the end of which military operations would be resumed and he would be granted the right of veto at the conference. This demand is at odds with the US resolve to end the war. Accordingly, the two-day talks on this issue between the US and Syngman Rhee reached an impasse. Right now, the Americans are inclined to put pressure on Syngman Rhee.On 29 June Clark unexpectedly replied to Kim Il Sung and Peng Dehuai's letter in the above circumstances. The purpose of this reply is, first, to show Syngman Rhee that the limit to concessions has been reached and that the US cannot make further concessions, and to try to sign an armistice agreement, ignoring Syngman Rhee's opposition; second, to show us to what limits he (Clark) can go in his guarantees; by signing an armistice agreement he hopes to strengthen his position in talks with Syngman Rhee (after an armistice it will be easier to limit weapons supplies to Syngman Rhee) and to remove the issue of the 27,000 POWs; third, to show the entire world that the US wants to end the war.It can be assumed that Syngman Rhee, who deeply understands the United States' weak points, will not make concessions. However, the US plays the main role in the war in Korea and it is possible for the sake of its own interests that it will increase pressure on Syngman Rhee at the necessary time. Therefore, although there are certain very great differences between Syngman Rhee and the US on the issue of an armistice, one can nevertheless speak of the possibility of achieving an armistice in Korea and at the same time say that Syngman Rhee will continue minor provocations after the armistice.CountermeasuresBased on the above situation and also bearing in mind the vacillation in US policy caused by the complex domestic and foreign differences with respect to South Korea, we suggest holding to the following policy:Retain the initiative in achieving an armistice, try to achieve a common point of view with the US on the issue of an armistice in order to isolate Syngman Rhee and strike him a blow, and also to force the US to put pressure on Syngman Rhee, and deepen the domestic and foreign differences of the American side. It is proposed to take the following steps in accordance with this policy:1. Prepare and send the reply of Kim Il Sung and Peng Dehuai to Clark on 5 July. In the reply agree to a resumption of negotiations, criticize the American side, and also indicate the possible consequences for the policy of collusion being pursued by the US.The text of the letter of reply is attached.2.  Prepare and launch a strike on the puppet troops of Syngman Rhee before the signing of an armistice in order to move the front line to the south. After the resumption of the meetings point out to the opposite side that, inasmuch as the signing of an armistice has been hampered  through the fault of Syngman Rhee, the situation has changed and, based on the agreement that a settlement ought to be achieved on the basis of the actual situation, propose revising the line of demarcation again.It can be assumed that the other side will agree with this proposal as a consequence of the complexity of its relations with Syngman Rhee at the present time. However, it is also quite possible that the other side will not make concessions and will resort to propaganda gimmicks. In this event, we are prepared, [after] having selected a suitable moment, to make the concessions in the end and set the line of demarcation as was agreed to on 17 June 1953.  3. Prepare for a resumption of the meetings of delegations after 6 July at which the following questions are to be put to the other side regarding the realization of an armistice agreement:1). The revision of the line of demarcation;2). Will Syngman Rhee be a party to the armistice and the associated issue of the timely evacuation of troops from the demilitarized zone in accordance with the armistice agreement?3). Will Syngman Rhee's clique participate in the joint inspection groups of the military armistice commission?4). The charging of the American side with the responsibility for returning the 27,000 POWs; if the American side declines this responsibility then we will retain the right to raise this question for discussion [at] the political conference;5). Guarantees for the security of the Red Cross joint groups when they conduct surveys of POWs and of the representatives for conducting explanatory work;6). Ensuring that POWs who insist upon repatriation are not subjected to forcible retention;7). The question of how to ensure the realization of \"the rights of a  repatriation commission of neutral countries\" when it resolves the problem of POWs not being directly repatriated and how to guarantee the security of the personnel and troops of this commission;8). The time that the work of the neutral observation commission is to begin work;9) [When] the armistice enters into force.4. Staff officers and interpreters should prepare for the signing of the armistice agreement simultaneously with the start of the meetings of the delegations. The construction of the premises in which the signing of the armistice is to be signed is being resumed.5. We think that the signing of the agreement might be scheduled for about 15 July. It is necessary to announce that the Polish and Czechoslovakian representatives and their deputies in the observation commission of neutral countries, members of 20 inspection groups, and also at least their operations staffs needed for the initial period will arrive in Peking on approximately 10 July. Be ready to report about this to the other side at the meeting of delegations\".\"To the Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Armed Forces, General Clark\".In your letter of reply of 29 June 1953 you admitted that the forced release of POWs of the Korean People's Army from POW camps by the Syngman Rhee clique and the forcible retention of these POWs is a serious and regrettable incident. This is correct. However, your explanations and the measures you have adopted with respect to this incident cannot be considered satisfactory.All the simple facts confirm that the UN forces cannot completely shed their responsibility for this incident. It has long been evident that the South Korean government and army prepared this incident in advance and your side knew about this but however took no steps to prevent it. After this incident emerged your side took no effective measures against the actions of the South Korean security detachments under the control of UN forces. These actions were directed at wrecking the agreement on POWs and forcing the POWs to leave the POW camp. After our letter of 12 June in which we pointed out that your side should pay serious attention to this, you as before allowed the South Korean security detachments to continue the forcible release of POWs from the camps. As a result of this the total number of POWs forcibly retained by the Syngman Rhee clique is more than 27,000, including more than 50 Chinese people's volunteers. In the 18 June letter of the chief of your delegation, General Harrison, and in your letter of reply of 29 June it says that measures are being taken at the present time to return the POWs \"who fled\". However, at the same time these letters contain a statement about the impossibility of completely returning these POWs. In fact the gendarmerie of your side received an order not to take any steps with respect to the POWs \"who fled\". In addition, it was complicit in the forcible sending of these POWs to military training centers of the Syngman Rhee army. In military terms the position taken during this period by UN forces boils down at the very least to complicity in the actions of the Syngman Rhee clique and the creation of obstacles in realizing an armistice.You try to compare the humane actions of our side which released POWs on the field of battle before the start of the armistice talks with the disruptive actions of the South Korean security detachments which forced POWS to leave camps after the conclusion of the POW agreement. This is completely untrue. With respect to the POWs \"who fled\" your side will bear full responsibility for their return In any event. We are forced to warn you that the Syngman Rhee clique is still continuing to shout that it intends to release and forcefully detain more than 3,500 POWs of the Korean People's Army who are not being directly repatriated. The Syngman Rhee clique in collusion with agents of Chiang Kai-shek is trying to force the Chinese people's volunteers POWs to leave the POW camps and thereby once and for all wreck the POW agreement which has already been reached by both sides. With respect to this incident, we think that your side should accept full responsibility and give guarantees that such incidents will not be repeated.Your letter contains a guarantee that UN forces will take possible military measures of a preventive nature at the necessary points in order to ensure the implementation of the armistice agreement. We think that this is necessary. However, your side declares that it cannot reliably guarantee the observance by the South Korean government and forces of an armistice agreement reached by the delegations of both sides. At the same time, the Syngman Rhee clique continues to shout that it \"will unify Korea by military means\". Just this statement alone is evidence of who began the aggression three years ago. If at the present time UN forces continue to indulge the Syngman Rhee clique and allow it to commit all sorts of criminal actions in order the undermine the possibility of solving the Korean issue, this will lead to, as before, [a situation where] armed aggression might flare up at any time against the Korean People's Democratic Government after the signing of an agreement for an armistice in Korea. Therefore, we think that your side ought to take effective steps so that the South Korean government and forces observe an armistice agreement and all other agreements relating to it. Only then might there be a guarantee that an armistice in Korea might not be violated.Based on the above, although your reply cannot also be considered entirely satisfactory, considering that your side has expressed a desire to exert efforts for a rapid achievement of an armistice and also taking into account the assurances you have given, we agree however to the delegations of both sides setting a meeting time and agreeing on the practical implementation of the issues relating to an armistice agreement which precede the signing of this agreement. The date of the meeting should be set by the heads of both delegations via the liaison officers. Supreme Commander of the Korean People's ArmyMarshal Kim Il SungCommanding General of the Chinese People's VolunteersPeng Dehaui5 July 1953After delivering this document Wu Xiuquan then orally reported the following at the instruction of Zhou Enlai.In the opinion of the PRC government, the latest provocative actions of Syngman Rhee are explained on the one hand by his desire to bargain with the US for a little more aid and on the other by a fear of the Chinese volunteers in Korea and China in general. This is why Syngman Rhee insists so stubbornly on concluding a \"mutual defense\" pact with the US.Syngman Rhee's statements that if the US does not meet his demands he will give an order for South Korean troops to fight to the end is an empty phrase.The PRC government thinks that the US will give Syngman Rhee only limited defensive aid. The US is afraid that if Syngman Rhee is given large-scale aid he might begin serious adventures and draw the US into them. However, the prospect of being drawn into any large adventures in the Far East does not suit the Americans right now. The Americans have certain differences with Syngman Rhee in this regard.There are also differences between Syngman Rhee and the US about behavior at a future political conference. Syngman Rhee thinks that if the conference does not accept his (Syngman Rhee's) demand then he ought to leave the conference and resume wide-scale offensive operations against North Korea even to the Yalu River, that is to the Korean-Chinese border. The Americans, for their part, think that the talks at a political conference ought to stop only in that the event it becomes obvious that the Korean-Chinese representatives at this conference seek what North Korea and China could not achieve through [force of] arms. Taking all the above into consideration, the PRC government considers it necessary to sign an armistice agreement in the interests of peace. \"In this case\", Wu Xiuquan joked, \"a paradoxical situation will be created inasmuch as we and the US are sort of acting together against Syngman Rhee\".Wu Xiuquan then said that, in the opinion of the PRC government, Syngman Rhee might be able to organize only minor provocations and dirty tricks but will not be able to mount anything more serious.In conclusion, Wu Xiuquan said that the PRC government awaits the opinion and comments of the Soviet government about the draft reply to Clark, the note, and those ideas which he was charged with describing orally.3 July 1953  Vas'kovPrinted from: AP RF.

According to the information received from a deputy of the foreign secretary, the leaders of the Yugoslav Foreign Secretariat were not surprised by the North Korean step, because the Korean [side] had informed them during the recent talks of the [Yugoslav and North Korean] foreign ministers. At that time, they were of the opinion that the DPRK considered itself stronger than South Korea, both in a political and an economic sense, and this is why it took the initiative more easily.

      "In response to a question, the South Vietnamese [PRG] ambassador, who paid me a farewell visit on [July] 8th, declared, among others, the following:1) In his view, the North Korean-South Korean joint declaration is [at least] as harmful to the existing but weak South Korean revolutionary forces as it is useful for the relaxation of tension on the Korean Peninsula, because it disarms [the revolutionaries].2) In his view, for the time being the main beneficiary of the joint declaration is Park Chung Hee, because it reinforces his position. Comment: it is possible that this is not just the personal opinion of the South Vietnamese ambassador but—taking into consideration the present difficult conditions in Vietnam—also the opinion of Vietnam.   The South Vietnamese ambassador also emphasized that the Vietnamese had supported the idea of [finding] a peaceful solution for the Korean question from the very beginning, and they would also like to solve their own Vietnamese question by peaceful means, but only in a principled way, without giving up their principles. The North Korean-South Korean joint declaration makes one think that the North gave up its principles, but this issue requires further analysis. 137 – K. \n",

He added that the African—including Mauritanian—contacts of the Republic of Mali might be helpful for the DPRK. In the opinion of the fraternal [diplomats], the delegation was received at a high level. The first speech of the Malian head of state was a reserved one as far as international affairs and the adulation of the DPRK were concerned. He spoke on the achievements of the struggles in Indochina and Africa, on the assistance provided by the socialist countries, on the Middle East, and on [the proposal] to make the Indian Ocean a zone of peace. On the Korean question, Mali has adopted and supported the standpoint of the DPRK. The movement of the non-aligned countries was extensively covered during the negotiations and in the speeches.The two sides are in agreement on that the 5th conference of the movement will be of historical significance. In his later speeches, the [Malian] head of state laid increasing stress on praising juche and Kim Il Sung. He called the achievements and experiences of the DPRK a model for the developing countries. The entourage of the head of state was composed mainly of economic experts. In the view of the Syrian ambassador, the agreement on economic and technical cooperation, which they signed, is not an important one. It has only political significance. The head of state made no request to the DPRK.In the opinion of the Soviet ambassador, a section of the delegation specifically studied the structure of the Korean Workers’ Party and the party’s methods of operation.

He has temporarily suppressed opposition and the resistance of the people, but this situation cannot last for a long time.

      "[...]Record of Conversation between Vice Foreign Minister Qiao Guanhua and [North] Korean Ambassador in China Pak Se-chang, 8 June 1965Time: 8 June 1965, 5:30pmLocation: East Foreign Ministry Building Reception RoomIn Attendance: Vice Minister Liu XianglunTranslator: Tang YingbinRecorder: Zhang QiSynopsis:The [North] Korean ambassador introduced the Algerian Special envoy [Mohamed] Yazid to discuss [North] Korean participation in the [Second] Asian-African Conference. Yazid primarily raised the following topics to the [North] Korean representative: 1. Tshombe's participation in the [Asian-African] Conference; 2. Vietnam's participation in the [Asian-African] Conference; 3. Malaysia's participation in the [Asian-African] Conference;  4. Participation of the South Korean puppets in the [Asian-African] Conference;  5. The USSR's participation in the [Asian-African] Conference;  6. Ben Bella's opening address. They also discussed China and [North] Korea's approval of Algeria's opposition to the participation of Tshombe and the South Vietnamese puppets in the conference and expressed wishes for representatives from the South Vietnamese Liberation Front [the Viet Cong] to attend as well. They expressed complete disapproval of the USSR participating.After the introduction by the [North] Korean ambassador, Vice Minister Qiao raised the topic of the past two days of the 7th Standing Committee meaning, the issue of a permanent structure [for the Asian-African Conference], and that of the Chinese and Vietnamese delegations' date of departure for participation in the Asia-Africa Conference. (After greetings are exchanged)Ambassador Pak [Se-chang]: I've come with our brother, the envoy from Algeria to discuss matters. After the envoy's arrival in [North] Korea, he met with our Foreign Ministry on 6 June, and he met with leader Kim [Il Sung] yesterday (the 7th). The Algerian envoy discussed a total of six points with us:1. Concerning the question of Tshombe, Algeria has chosen not to issue an invitation because the majority of Asian and African countries oppose Tshombe. It would be improper to issue him an invitation.2. As for South Vietnam, Algeria has decided not to invite the puppets from Saigon to participate, and instead to invite representatives from the South Vietnamese Liberation Front to attend as observers.3. In regards to Malaysia, Yazid only mentioned that Algeria has sent an envoy to discuss this issue with Sukarno.4. Regarding South Korea, though the decision was made at Jakarta to invite them, Algeria has yet to issue said invitation. He said that Algeria has decided to maintain this position until the Foreign Ministers' Conference at which point they will meet and again consider the situation.5. On the question of the participation of the USSR, he has expressed that Algeria's position is a difficult one. Algeria has difficulty taking an active stance on this issue.6. Lastly, on the topic of Ben Bella's inauguration speech, he said that Ben Bella's speech will not be one of etiquette and formality, rather one that will set the course for the conference as well as clarify his own positions.After Yazid explained Algeria's positions, we discussed our own attitudes on the aforementioned topics.Firstly, we expressed our approval of their decision not to allow Tshombe and the South Vietnamese puppets to attend the conference. We hope that representatives from the South Vietnamese Liberation Front will be allowed to attend as formal delegates representing South Vietnam. We told them that this is our wish. We also explained to the Algerian representative that the South Vietnamese puppets are simply cronies of imperialism and cannot represent South Vietnam. Additionally, we told the envoy that we take a position of utter opposition to the question of the USSR's participation in the conference. Finally, we will certainly raise the flag of revolution high at this conference's meeting, increasing cohesion in the struggle of the Asian and African peoples. We wish them success in their struggle.These were basically the topics of our conversation with the Algerian envoy.Additionally, in order to help our Algerian counterpart understand the situation of South Korea, we provided a set of materials such as proof that South Korea is actively deploying troops to South Vietnam, etc.Our primary goal at this conference is to clarify our positions to Algeria, and to wish that our coming together for the Asia-Africa Conference will bring about significant achievements.When I picked him up at the airport early this morning he said that this meeting was very successful, he is quite satisfied with the results.Vice Minister Qiao [Guanhua]: Thank you for your explanation.After Yazid returned to Beijing yesterday, we received him on behalf of the Afro-Asian Peoples' Solidarity Organization and invited him to a meal, since Yazid is the Algerian chairman of the Afro-Asian Peoples' Solidarity Organization. He told us that Algeria is prepared to raise high the flag of opposition to imperialism and colonialism. Yesterday we were rather busy and unable to receive him, so [Vice] Premier Chen Yi met him at the airport this afternoon to speak with him for a while. He is very satisfied with the meeting with North Korea. I asked him, “What do you think of South Korea attending the conference?”  They said that they completely support North Korea's position and that they want to try it and see.Pak: They said they will wait until the Foreign Ministers' conference and continue observation.Qiao: Alright, then we will both continue to work hard.Algeria has some experience. There was a time in their history where their situation was similar to that of present day Vietnam. We hope they will continue their work. We hope that by holding this conference in Algeria, we can help to spread their influence. This discussion has clarified some previous questions, indicating that the work we have done with them has been of some use.In addition, we discussed the question of whether or not to establish a permanent structure to these conferences after the conclusion of this one. We expressed our position, which is that it would be best not to. He said that this problem should be easy to handle, and that he will pass our opinions on the Ben Bella.Pak: Do they wish to establish a permanent structure [for the Asian-African Conference]?Qiao: He thinks that if we are to establish such a system, that we should do so in Algeria, just as Indonesia wants to do something similar in their country. He says that the matter should be easy to handle, but in reality it's not that he doesn't want to do it. If we are to do it, we should do it in Algeria, or not at all.Our position is that even though everyone agrees that we should hold the conferences in Beijing, we do not want to do it, it would be very inconvenient. It would take a large amount of energy, so we do not want to argue about this in future. Last time we met with [Foreign Minister] Subandrio, he agreed that we should not establish such a system, but the Indonesian Vice Foreign Minister, Mme. Supeai, has advocated such a system when visiting China in the past. It's possible that they still had not notified her. These are matters that concern Yazid.As for the matter of the standing committee, the telegrams we have received are still not complete. But there is something we can discuss.As for the economic issue, we have expressed that we do not approve of the standing committee writing a document of our collective comments on the United Nations Trade and Development Conference in Geneva. We spoke on this matter all day on both the 4th and 5th. There are some right now who support our stance. The result of our deliberation is that the standing committee will not write a formal document; rather, send a record to the Foreign Ministers' Conference along with an ordered letter showing the topics we discussed for their reference. But, this letter could become a formal document. Even if it is formally written by Algeria, we will still have a look before it is sent.As for the opposition to the Saigon puppets and Park Chung Hee clique attending the conference, we three nations have done well. They are preparing to bring up these two issues at the same time, but up until now there has never been any result. I estimate that they will certainly fail in creating a partnership. There are some who choose to advocate on this issue and some who choose not to. They will argue about it; one way or another they will argue about this kind of thing, but once they're done arguing they can bring the issue to the Foreign Ministers' Conference.Has your delegation solidified their plans?Pak: We still have not heard who will be included in our delegation, nor when they will leave.Qiao: Comrade Zhou Enlai is currently out making visits; he plans to go to Algeria to have talks before the conference.Pak: He won't return to Beijing before the conference?Qiao:  He will. Comrade Zhou Enlai left for Tanzania today. He will come back before going to Algeria. I think our delegation will leave a little early. Since they will go to the United Arab Republic [Egypt] first, they should leave early. However, we won't decide the exact date until Comrade Zhou Enlai comes back. We'll let you know as soon as we've decided.   Pak: Thank you very much.Qiao: We can cooperate. Once the Vice Premier of Vietnam, Comrade Nguyen Duy Trinh, is done visiting Africa he can go directly to the conference. Aside from him there is also a group of comrades who plan to leave Hanoi on the 14th, arrive in Beijing on the 15th, and then go to Algeria. Lastly, there is Prime Minister Pham Van Dong who still has not decided when to leave for the conference. We've been handling these issues over the past few days. Pak: Yes, as the time for the conference nears, we'll be more and more busy.[...]\n",

      "1. For some time the diplomatic corps has been speculating about the fact that starting with the second half of April, Ri Hyo-sun [Ri Hyo Sun] and Pak Geum-cheol [Pak Kum Chol], members of the Politburo Presidium and of the WPK Central Committee Secretariat, have not been seen in public. 2. These speculations have been confirmed. For instance, in a conversation with Ionescu Teofil, the Second Secretary from the Hungarian Embassy, Karoy, said that several Koreans informed him about the removal from the superior party and state leadership of several people, among whom he mentioned Ri Hyo-sun, Pak Geum-cheol, Go Hyeok [Ko Hyok], Vice-President of the Council of Ministers, and Kim Do-man [Kim To Man], secretary of the Central Committee.The Hungarian diplomat told us that the North Koreans avoid directly answering any questions about the reasons for the purge of these officials. They only say that while they can tolerate deviations from the party line, they can’t tolerate a lack of respect for the leader - Kim Il Sung.3. In our discussions on these matters, Polish and East German diplomats confirm that the purge of the aforementioned officials, together with many more from the Ministry of Culture, Health, Railway Transportation, Light Industry, as well as the assignment of the members of the Pyongyang party committee to do menial work, marks the re-emergence of Kim Il Sung’s cult of personality after the removal of the aforementioned officials in March-April. In the period before the October 1966 party conference and immediately afterwards, the cult of personality was visibly diminished, and the role of the Party and of the people in Korean life and in the accomplishment of their successes to date was much more emphasized. Given the positions of the aforementioned purged officials, it can be inferred that they opposed the cult of personality in one way or another, favoring instead the introduction of collective work, and the leading role of the party.Some diplomatic sources suggest that they were the partisans of an independent and principled foreign policy, equidistant towards the USSR and the PRC and in line with the efforts meant to strengthen the unity and the cohesion of the socialist bloc. In this respect, our office was informed by telegram in the eve of the October 1966 Party Conference that Kim Il Sung had encountered objections to his exclusivity policy with the USSR. 4. Pak Geum-cheol was in charge of ideological and political matters in the Politburo; until the Party Conference, Ri Hyo-sun was in charge of organizational affairs and the South Korean problem. After the party conference, he was responsible only for South Korea, as his organizational responsibilities were passed on to Kim Yeong-ju [Kim Yong Ju], Kim Il Sung’s brother (recently promoted to the rank of deputy member of the Politburo and secretary of the Central Committee). Go Hyeok was responsible for cultural matters. Kim Do-man was the head of the Propaganda Section within the Central Committee.We will continue following these matters and keep you informed.\n",

      "According to the information provided by the [North] Korean ambassador, his government intends to increase its presence in Africa, and at the same time it seeks to gain support to the unification of the country. To achieve these aims, they extend the network of their diplomatic representations in Africa, and they also participate in every action and forum activity that might be helpful for them.Their efforts include the development of bilateral relations. In Angola, he said, their initiatives had been favorably received so far. On the basis of an TSC [agreement on technical and scientific cooperation], at present 50 Korean technical experts work [in Angola], of whom 20 are [engaged] in agriculture, while 30 are providing guidance to the reconstruction of the textile industry. Their working conditions are identical with that of the other [technical experts]. According to their experiences, their technical experts easily endure the problems of accommodation and the working conditions. Their plans include the dispatching of additional technical experts, but for the time being, the Angolan side placed some more important issues on the agenda. In the opinion of the Koreans, the Angolan side, having been liberated from the paralyzing effect of the sabotage activities that affected the entire economy, should now give a green light to the assistance of the socialist countries, which would facilitate [economic] recovery.According to the ambassador, Angolan-Korean cooperation has started in the field of ideology, too. On the initiative of the Angolan side, circles for the joint study of the works of [Agostinho] Neto and Kim Il Sung have been formed both in Luanda and in the countryside. They strove to broaden this [activity], but certain events have intervened.Concerning the latter issue, I would like to note that it is being discussed even among the fraternal [diplomats] that the Korean [embassy] was one of those embassies which the Angolan official documents describe as having maintained contacts with the group of Nito Alves long before the events [the coup attempt of Alves in May 1977].69 – A. \n",

      "Premier Zhou [Enlai] (to be abbreviated as Zhou): Several Vice Premiers could not be here today because they are ill. How many Vice Premiers do you have?Pak Geum-cheol (to be abbreviated as Pak): Seven. (eventually changed to eight)Zhou: We have sixteen. How many Vice Chairmen does your Standing Committee have?Pak: We have three [Vice Chairmen]: Kang Ryang-uk [Kang Ryang Uk], Han Seol-ya [Han Sol Ya], and Paek Nam-un [Paek Nam Un].Zhou: We have thirteen Vice Chairmen. How many parties does [North Korea] have?Pak: We have the Korean Social Democratic Party and the Chondoist Chongu Party. The people in charge [of these parties] are all here (referring to Kang Ryang-uk and Pak Sin-deok). There are also some small parties that came over from South Korea. These parties exist only in name, such as the National Independence Party.Zhou: Are they connected to the South?Pak: Due to the military demarcation line, there are no public connections [but] there are some secret underground connections. There are more fishermen who come [to North Korea from South Korea] by sea. There are hundreds of people [who come] every year.Zhou: It is convenient to conduct contact through fishermen. The sea provides a very good opportunity for contact.Pak: It is a very good opportunity [and] we want to maintain this relationship in the future. Most of the people that come over are good people, but there are also some bad elements. After they come, we show them our factories, we take care of them, and in many cases they return to [South Korea] and say good things [about North Korea].Zhou: This kind of work can be expanded because there is no 38th parallel at sea.Pak: Even at sea, American guard ships conduct interceptions, so the fishermen come over at night.Zhou: The [fishermen] have needs. We have already introduced the parties of the National People’s Congress to you. Our government departments also have other parties; they probably all attended Chairmen Zhu [De’s] party. Recently our newspapers all published the file passed by the [North] Korean Supreme People’s Assembly. The President of the Assembly wrote to us and we also received a telegram. The newspapers also published Comrade Choe Yong-geon’s report on South Korea and on opposing the American-Park Chung Hee bloc. Apart from our support for your “25 June” commemorative activities, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress and our government will also take actions to support you. The United States is quite nervous because its provocative actions in Asia have all received counter blows. Its recent troop deployment in Thailand was opposed by various socialist countries and was opposed and criticized by other countries in Asia. Even its allies are offering differing opinions and criticisms. The United States is isolated as a result of its troop deployment in Thailand, particularly since the three forces in Laos have already joined together to form a coalition government. The Geneva Conference is also early next month, and so the United States will become even more isolated. The [North] Korean Supreme People’s Assembly’s file condemning the provocations of the American-Park Chung Hee bloc in South Korea and requesting the withdrawal of American troops came at an appropriate time. It is an effective action in striking against the U.S. At the same time, Vietnam also took similar actions to criticize the American-Ngo Dinh Diem bloc and requested the withdrawal of American troops from South Vietnam. We also publicly revealed the American-Jiang Jieshi [Chiang Kai-shek] conspiracy to conduct provocations and landings across the Taiwan Strait. The coordination between our fraternal countries is excellent; the coordination between Asian countries is also excellent. The United States’ plan is to create a crescent shaped encirclement; from South Korea, Japan, the Philippines, South Vietnam, Malaya, Thailand, Pakistan, India, and then west to include Iran and Turkey, this would encircle Soviet Asia. The current American actions in South Korea, South Vietnam, and Taiwan, as well as the activities of the 7th Fleet, are inseparable elements from its plan. However, the United States also admits that its plans are incomplete, that there are some gaps, and its allies are not united. For example, relations between South Korea and Japan are not yet [agreed upon]. On the one hand Jiang Jieshi and the Americans are cooperating and want to try to conduct provocations in the Taiwan Strait, but, on the other, there are also contradictions. Yesterday, Kennedy told journalists that Jiang Jieshi is not allowed to act without permission; this could also be a double act, but for Jiang Jieshi it looks bad, it is difficult to be a son. It seems the United States is sparing no expense to expand its military and prepare for war and they are expanding their bases as much as they can. However, there are many loopholes and the situation is not to their advantage. The most important experience is that the United States’ weakness emerges when socialist countries and nationally independent countries join together in condemning American military provocations. If we become tough, then they become soft. The formation of the Laos coalition government proves this point. Phoumi Nosavan is a product of the United States and in the past he produced serious troubles, [but] since everyone strongly opposed American troop deployments to Thailand, he had to concede and agree to the formation of a coalition government. This is a victory for Laos. Of course, the United States will not take a softer stance on all issues due to one incident. In order to fight its arrogance, we still need to conduct struggles on all fields. On this point, both of our parties, national assemblies, and governments all hold the same view: we cannot be soft on the United States; we can only beat them back by confronting them. The United States’ condition in Asia is vulnerable. In order to strike, we must have firm preparations. [North] Korea, China, and [North] Vietnam all share this view. If they come they will destroy us; if they do not come then we should prepare. Preparations will help us avoid trouble. We admire and support the foreign policy of the Korean Workers’ Party. The Geneva Conference is about to be held, and we have sent the Vice Foreign Minister [to the conference]; if an agreement is reached in the future then we will have the Foreign Minister sign the agreement. We are prepared to continue to expose American provocations in Asia. The United States needs to be responsible for the tense situation in Asia, which includes the Korea issue. [We] want the United States to withdraw troops from various places of tension. (Towards Comrade Chen Yi) Does Comrade Foreign Minister have anything to say?Chen Yi: The Premier has said it all. I do not have anything to say. Let us have comrade Kang Sheng present the gifts? (Comrade Kang Sheng presented a 15th century book of ancient Korean poetry to comrade Pak Geum-cheol. Pak expressed his thanks. Premier Zhou said that they are continuing to expand their collection and if they find more they will present them [to North Korea]. Then he talked about his trip to Jilin. Jilin was the site where Premier Kim Il Sung studied and conducted anti-Japanese struggles. Local authorities [at Jilin] have been instructed to collect items for commemoration. Section skipped.)Zhou: Regarding some situations at the Geneva Conference, we can have the Foreign Ministry inform Comrade Ambassador. Although this is a local issue, it relates to the world anti-imperialist struggle.Pak: When we went to Andong [Dandong], Shenyang, Tianjin, Beijing, Wuhan, Shanghai, and Hangzhou, our delegation received the enthusiastic welcome of the Chinese people everywhere. We were received like blood brothers. Today with the Premier and the Vice Premiers here, I want to say that our time in China has been very delightful and joyous. Our meeting with Chairman Mao [Zedong] in Wuhan was particularly important, and Chairman Mao discussed the relationship between our two parties and the [overall] situation with us. During our visit, we also had discussions with Comrade Peng Zhen, Comrade Deng Xiaoping, and Chairman Liu [Shaoqi] about opposing revisionism. Today Premier Zhou also discussed many issues with us, all of them very important. Earlier Premier Zhou talked about the issue of opposing imperialism. American imperialism is our mortal enemy; the Korean [Workers’] Party and the Korean people are absolutely firm about this. The Korean [Workers’] Party and the Korean people clearly understand that the Chinese [Communist] Party and the Chinese people have always assisted us throughout history. At the same time [the Chinese] have also provided enthusiastic support for our current foreign policy. The main focus of our work within the Party is to educate the people to oppose revisionism and to conduct a long term struggle against imperialism. Therefore we oppose becoming undisciplined; [we] must maintain our vigilance. We educate Party members to oppose western trends [as] western trends emerge from moral degeneration and make people desire peaceful lives. We must therefore oppose moral degeneration. The Premier also understands that the situation before and after the liberation of Korea is complicated. After the war, Korea’s revolutionary mission became even more complicated. [Although] the enemy organized anti-communist organizations in Korea, the Party has concentrated on reforming them and uniting with them to jointly engage in construction. We have already made some achievements and we will continue this work. Regarding the economic situation, we are currently struggling for year two of the Seven-Year Plan. During this year, we want to occupy the Six Peaks. As Vice Premier Luo [Ruiqing] knows, this spring when tensions were high, we sent Chief of Staff Kim Chang-bong over [to China]. Due to heightened tensions at the time, we had considered compressing the Six Peaks [in order to] strengthen national defense. [But] judging from the current situation, we can still continue with the original plan. The transformation of the production relationship between urban and rural areas was completed smoothly, but there were shortcomings. Some people become complacent with small achievement [only]. Premier Kim [Il Sung] instructed us to be attentive and prevent that from happening. In terms of future plans, Premier Kim is considering a continuation of this year’s standards: work hard on agriculture and then work on national defense with the remaining strength. The firm Marxist-Leninist and anti-revisionist positions of our two parties will not change and in the future our position will also be completely identical to the Chinese [Communist] Party’s. Regardless of possible difficulties and complex situations, our party and people—in accordance with the spirit and instruction of Premier Kim—will always stand together with the Chinese [Communist] Party. The Chinese [Communist] Party has a long history and is rich in experience. The relationship between our two parties was formed through mutual-assistance in long periods of difficult struggle. [Our relationship] was formed particularly under the principles of Marxism-Leninism and our unity and friendship remain constant. Premier Kim often tells us that we cannot sell out our friends in any situation and we have memorized his words. Premier Kim also tells me often that, from generation to generation, we cannot forget—but actually it is impossible to forget—how the Chinese [Communist] Party, Chairman Mao Zedong, and the Chinese people sent the [Chinese People’s] Volunteer Army to assist us in our most difficult times. I want to say again that this was my first time meeting Chairman Mao and it was also the first time for the comrades of the delegation, and we were all very happy [to meet him]. We are the offspring of the revolution, we are still young. Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou provided us with analyses on many important issues, and they told us that we should keep [their analyses] close to heart because they have significant meaning towards our education. I am not providing pleasant words today because Premier Zhou is here with us, [rather it is because] Premier Kim often taught us that the Chinese [Communist] Party has a long history and was trained through extended periods of arduous struggle. We want to emphasize learning from the Chinese [Communist] Party—[we] learned from [you] in the past and will continue to do so in the future. [All of the above] are words from our heart. While we do have some achievements in socialist development, we cannot be proud; we need to continue to learn from China. Meeting Premier Zhou today makes [me] very content. After we came to China, our lives have become very pleasant.Zhou: Comrade Pak’s speech is excellent. We are very moved and encouraged. On behalf of my colleagues and the government, I would like to first welcome the delegation’s visit. [On the other hand] we are sorry for coming late and receiving you late. However, we compensated for that by having met you earlier in Shenyang. I am ahead because I am still earlier than Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.Pak: Meeting Premier Zhou in Shenyang—on the one hand, this made me content but on the other hand made me feel sorry.Zhou: There is nothing to feel sorry about. [The meeting in Shenyang] was to show that our friendship is brotherly! Earlier, we discussed the issues of opposing revisionism, opposing imperialism, upholding the principles of Marxism-Leninism, socialist development, and [maintaining the] unity of the international proletariats. Our views are identical. This consensus [between us] is not coincidental. It has historical roots and has been tested by combat. Without talking about the far [past], we have been assisting each other ever since the old democratic revolutionary era. Chairman Mao said in Wuhan that we will not talk about these things. We have been assisting each other ever since the birth of our two parties some forty years ago, we have been through the tests of many arduous struggles, and we have been united. Since the artillery fires of the October Revolution, we had the May Fourth Movement and you also had your revolutionary movement. From that time onwards, Korean comrades have consistently taken up positions within the Chinese revolution. We often tell the Chinese people and younger comrades that the Korean comrades participated in each stage of the Chinese revolution. [This is] particularly [true with] the united anti-Japanese forces in [China’s] Northeast led by comrade Kim Il Sung; he firmly continued the struggle in high mountains. Chairman Mao often tells us to thank the Korean comrades. This time in Wuhan, Chairman Mao said it again. Comrade Pak Geum-cheol had said that in the past Premier Kim often [emphasized] the Chinese People’s Volunteer Army crossing the river to assist [North] Korea during the War to Resist America and Aid Korea. However, in this regard, the Korean people made greater sacrifice and the Chinese people only provided partial [assistance]. Mainly it is [North] Korea that assisted China: you have guarded the eastern outpost of the entire socialist camp; you have guarded northern Korea; you have guarded China’s development. We are speaking from our heart. We often say the same words to our cadres. Everyone who has been to [North] Korea or participated in the War to Resist America and Aid Korea is moved by your spirit in this arduous struggle. The exception being very few people such as Peng Dehuai and others, who conducted subversive activities, [but] everyone else has been moved. Even today, your spirit still has a very great influence within our military. Everyone who has been [to North Korea] all feel that the hard working and tough spirit of the Korean people under the leadership of Premier Kim Il Sung and the Korean Workers’ Party is worth learning from. The recent activities of modern revisionism further revealed the significance of raising the flags of anti-imperialism, anti-revisionism and concerted action. Your newspapers often deepen the education of the people by publishing anti-revisionist historical materials. This is a good measure as it helps to deepen the education of the people. Mutual economic assistance is [also] very necessary. We are fraternal countries that share the same woes; your achievements are also ours. We feel uneasy that we cannot provide many items to you on time because of the natural disasters that are affecting our agriculture. This is also the case in the area [managed by] Chief of the General Staff Luo [Ruiqing]. Military assistance also cannot be provided in a timely manner particularly for aircrafts [transfers are delayed]. Every time when Comrade Ri Ju-yeon and Comrade Kim Chang-bong come over to visit us, we always feel uneasy that we cannot provide things as promised. With our current adjustments, things will be better after recovery starts, but it will take time. We hope that you obtain victory in the struggle to obtain the Six Peaks. Comrade Premier’s direction for next year is very correct. We hope that when things become better next year, we will be able to gradually satisfy your needs. As for the welcoming we provided the [North Korean] delegation, it comes from our heart. The Chinese people, assembly, party and government all feel this way. Our reception for you is nothing compared to your reception of several hundred thousands of [Chinese People’s] volunteer soldiers. We will never forget how you passionately received the [Chinese People’s] Volunteer Army in Korea. Marshal Chen seated here has been to [North] Korea with me, Marshal He [Long], and Chief of the General Staff Luo have both been [to North Korea before]. Marshal He went twice; Comrade Deng Xiaoping and Comrade Kang Shen both went [to North Korea] before; Comrade Peng Zhen also went [to North Korea] this time. The warm reception that our five delegations received cannot be compared with our reception for you.He Long: I first went to [North] Korea when the war had just stopped. There were not even houses, [but] the people [still] very enthusiastically welcomed us.\tZhou: We will never forget all of this, your receptions are far better than our [receptions].Peng Zhen: All five visits were received very well.Zhou: We cannot return the debt. One phrase, our parties are together because of history, because of revolution, and because of friendship formed through combat—we can never be separated. We will always be together through thick and thin, we will walk together towards socialism, towards communism.(After the conversation, the Premier hosted a dinner for the delegation. After the meal, the Premier stayed to discuss the Sino-[North] Korean border issue with Ambassador Han Ik-su [Han Ik Su]. That conversation record has been organized separately)\n",

      "Record of the Second Meeting between Premier Zhou and Prime Minister U Nu(Not Yet Approved) Time: 29 June 1954, 11:15-12:30Accompanying personnel from China: Tong QianriAccompanying personnel from Burma: U Kyaw Nyein, U Myint Thein Zhou Enlai: There is no agreement of a political nature between China and Burma. Between China and India there is an agreement related to trade and transportation between Chinese Tibet and India; in the preamble of that agreement, China and India both made an assurance of a political nature. However there is no agreement like this between China and Burma. This time [I] once talked with Prime Minister Nehru in Delhi. I said, the Chinese policy towards Burma is the same as the [Chinese] policy towards India; therefore if Burma is willing then I will initiate and bring forth an agreement with a [similar] nature; it will be beneficial to friendly relations and peaceful coexistence between China and Burma. Prime Minister Nehru replied and said this is a good idea, but the agreement will require time; the passage of this time through Yangon is brief, therefore why not issue a joint declaration prior to the signing of an agreement as a start; then decide what form should be adopted depending on the situation of the preparation work. I thought that view is excellent; therefore I reported [to you] the content of the discussion between me and Prime Minister Nehru. What is the view of Prime Minister U Nu? U Nu: We should do as [suggested by Prime Minister Nehru]. We can first issue a joint statement and then consider signing an agreement. Zhou Enlai: Good.U Nu: Regarding the contents of the joint statement, I have the following six suggestions: (1) Accept the five principles in the joint statement from China and India and include them into our joint statement. (2) The two countries of China and Burma jointly declare, [we] will not participate in conspiracies to overthrow the legitimate governments of China and Burma. (3) China and Burma will jointly issue an appeal, the targets [of the appeal] are Burmese communists and the Jiang Jieshi [Chiang Kai-shek] elements, but it is not necessary to explain specifics. We will appeal to them and tell them to give up incorrect thoughts and use peaceful ways to solve disputes. (4) The two countries will solemnly assure that they will do everything within [their] powers to further peace in the world and especially in South East Asia. (5) The border between China and Burma is not yet clear, in our joint statement we can express that we will take steps; but it is unnecessary to explain the specifics of these steps.(6) In a letter from Nehru, he said during a discussion between your Excellency and him, [your Excellency] once said that if overseas Chinese have already obtained the citizenship of the host country then China will no longer view them as Chinese citizens; if they continue to maintain the identity of Chinese citizens then they should abide by the laws of the host countries and should not participate in the politics of the host country. I hope to include this into our joint statement. Zhou Enlai: Just now Prime Minister U Nu agreed that a specific agreement will require preparatory work and consideration regarding its form; therefore it will require time. This is to say, specific issues need to be prepared in order to produce appropriate articles; this isn’t something that can be solved by a hastily prepared statement. It is also related to the laws of various countries, such as the issue of approving jurisdiction; this also isn’t something that can be resolved by a joint statement issued by the prime ministers of two countries.According to [the above], I will bring forth the following views towards the six points of suggestion from Prime Minister U Nu. In terms of general spirit, our views are mostly the same. However regarding certain points, I still have some opinion; now [I] will answer separately: Regarding the first point and the fourth point, there is no problem; these two points are our common wishes and should be recorded down. Regarding the second point, if Prime Minister U Nu’s view is to say no interference in internal affairs then we can add a few lines in the joint statement about this principle. I do not agree with Prime Minister U Nu’s suggested wording. If the prime ministers of two countries speak as such in the joint statement then it will give people an impression that this point has already become an issue, or there is already some truth in it, or that it takes two prime ministers to close the rumor; which would not be good. Although this is our first meeting, I will say frankly that [I] cannot accept Prime Minister U Nu’s suggested second point. According to the reaffirmed five principles in the joint statement from China and India; we can say that it is appropriate for the relationship between China and Burma; we can even specially mention mutual non-interference in each other’s internal affairs and mutual non-aggression. China will not interfere with Burma’s internal affairs. Burma will not interfere with China’s internal affairs. China understands that Li Mi’s forces pose a difficult problem for Burma, it is also a threat to Burma; the Burmese government did not subjectively allow them to be here. If the affair with Li Mi’s forces must be [text illegible] just as Prime Minister U Nu suggested then it would not be good. Therefore, why don’t we say, the principles of mutual non-interference in each other’s internal affairs and mutual non-aggression will be specially used in all relations between China and Burma.Regarding the third point, according to Prime Minister U Nu’s suggestion, is that the governments of our two countries will say to their people to not hope for outside assistance. To have the head figures of the government of our two countries say that in a joint statement is equal to admitting that the people of each other’s countries have such a hope; which will become a serious issue. Not to mention the prime minister of one country appealing to the people of another country is also interference in [another’s] internal affairs. Therefore this kind of wording must be [used] very carefully. Why don’t we say the governments of the two countries acknowledge that the people of any country possess the right to choose their own country’s system and life style; other countries cannot inference [in this]. The Chinese people already chose the current system, if the Jiang Jieshi elements stir up trouble then the Burmese government will not assist [them]. This kind of wording will allow the people of the two countries to have a clear understanding, and it will not involve internal affairs, therefore this kind of wording is beneficial for both sides. Regarding the fifth point, the issue of the border between China and Burma is an issue left behind by history; it is especially an issue not resolved by the Guomindang [Kuomintang] era. I agree this issue needs to be resolved in the future. However, this issue is too specific, it is impossible to mention in a joint statement. According to my understanding, Prime Minister U Nu’s meaning is that: Although [the issue of] the border between China and Burma has been dragged out for a very long time, the [two countries] have always been able to get along peacefully; the two countries hereby express they are gratified. As for how to write down this point with the appropriate wording, it can be studied. Regarding the sixth point, the issue of nationality of overseas Chinese is also an issue left behind by history. As for the existence of this issue, the new China cannot be held responsible. Just then Prime Minister U Nu quoted from Prime Minister Nehru’s letter; [the quote] is correct. That is new China’s direction on the issue of overseas Chinese. Regarding this specific issue, the Chinese government is about to negotiate with the Indonesian delegation. Your Excellency knows that there are the most overseas Chinese in Indonesia. According to the above described direction and after the issue of overseas Chinese in Indonesia has been solved by specific stipulation with Indonesia, then we will solve the issue of overseas Chinese with other countries such as Burma using the same stipulation. Since currently there is no such stipulation, then the mentioning of this issue by the prime ministers of two countries will [cause] involvement in issues of internal laws of the two countries and international laws. My discussion with Prime Minister Nehru is the same as the discussion with the prime minister of Burma (especially since Prime Minister Nehru has already corresponded), now I can prove that is true once again. In the future we will solve issues according to this policy. I want to provide a suggestion for the other sixth point, which is according to the eighth point of the joint statement from China and India; the two countries of China and Burma will also express [willingness to] strengthen friendly relations between the two countries by frequent interaction. Does Prime Minister U Nu agree?U Nu: Regarding the second point, if your Excellency agrees to mention again the two principles of mutual non-aggression and mutual non-interference in each other’s affairs, then that is sufficient. The wording [issue] can be handled by people [responsible] for drafts. Regarding the third point, if your Excellency does not like my suggested appeal, then other than what your Excellency has just suggested, I suggest to include what your Excellency said at the journalist reception in Delhi, which is: Revolution cannot be exported, at the same time, a country’s people’s expressed common will cannot tolerate outside interference.Regarding the fifth point which is the border issue between the two countries, my meaning is to ambiguously mention it and only say that this issue has not yet been resolved and that steps will be taken in the future; rather than any mention of specific steps. Other than that, the suggestion mentioned by your Excellency just then can also be included.Regarding the sixth issue, which is the issue of overseas Chinese, we can cancel it. I do not have a resolute view on this matter; I only like very much the view expressed by your Excellency. I agree with your Excellency’s suggested sixth point. Zhou Enlai: The second and third point can be drafted according to the views of both sides. Regarding the fifth point, which is the border issue, I am still wondering if it should be written down, because I am considering the issue of my own personal power. I personally believe, on principle, it should not be a problem. However the Chinese government has not yet placed the border issue between China and various countries onto the agenda. The Chinese government is so far not willing to touch this issue, because currently it is not possible to handle this issue. Before handling this issue, there is still a lot of work to be done, such as measuring, etc. If the Chinese and Burmese joint statement wants to mention this issue, then I will have to send a telegram back to my country and ask for instructions. According to the procedure of the Chinese government for handling matters, this kind of issue is handed to the Central People’s Government Committee for discussion or decided by the Central People’s Government Chairman. U Nu: In the past when we [contacted] the Chinese government to resolve the border issue, we always received a similar answer, therefore the Burmese people are puzzled. They are thinking, does China have ambitions towards Burma’s territory? Exactly for this reason, I suggested to ambiguously mention [the border issue] in the joint statement.Zhou Enlai: I am not saying that this issue will not be resolved. I am saying that if this issue is mentioned by the joint statement then I will be involved in issues related to my own personal power. U Nu: All right, let us cancel this issue. Let us maintain contact between us, once your Excellency obtains power, please inform [us] by telegram. I will also frequently instruct my ambassador to provide specific suggestions to the Chinese government. Zhou Enlai: Agreed(At this time Qiao Guanhua and U Myint Thein leave the conference room to go to another room upstairs in order to draft the Chinese and Burmese joint statement)U Nu: Burma’s population is only eighteen million. And China’s Yunnan province alone has sixteen million to twenty million people. Therefore, Burma’s population is only equal to one of China’s provinces. Burma does have some fears towards China, and hopes that China respects the territorial integrity of Burma. Your Excellency please forgive our fear [of China]. I want to bring forth an appeal to your Excellency (not mentioned within the joint statement), we believe that China is our big brother, we hope that China can take steps to eliminate our fear. Zhou Enlai: Prime Minister Nehru once discussed this issue with me. He said that the small countries around the two countries of India and China have this kind of thought. In the past I knew a bit; this time after conversing with Prime Minister Nehru, I understood even more. Exactly for this reason, while I was at the journalist reception in Delhi, I specifically picked a question to answer. I said of all the countries in the world, regardless if they are large or small, strong or weak, regardless of [differences] in social systems, as long as they handle relations with each other using the five principles from the agreement between China and India, then they can all get along peacefully. This is also exactly what Prime Minister U Nu quoted just then.Regarding this aspect, I can personally and frankly tell Prime Minister U Nu that the policy of the new China is the policy of peace. We are willing to [follow these five principles] of respecting each other’s territorial sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference into each other’s affairs, equal and mutual benefits, coexist peacefully and get along with all countries in the world; not to mention Burma and China are countries with a connection as relatives. China sees India and Burma as the same, India’s population is second in the world with three hundred and sixty million [people], Burma’s population is smaller but we did not differentiate because of differences in size between India and Burma. When we send out visiting delegations, we visit India and Burma at the same time. When we establish friendship associations, we establish Sino-Indian and Sino-Burmese friendship associations at the same time. [The above] proves that we see India and Burma as the same.As for territory, China is already a large place with a large population. Our nation founding policy is to make our own country great. We do not have any territorial ambitions. Now that I am making this statement, Prime Minister U Nu can believe [in it]. In the past we have participated in very few international activities. This time participating in the Geneva conference is our first time. Reason being, we are already very busy with internal affairs, we cannot handle it all. We are willing to establish [relations] with our neighbors and get along peacefully with them. We are not willing to see our neighbors allow foreign interventionists establish military bases. Burma, India and Indonesia did not agree with the United States organizing an invasive bloc in South East Asia and oppose the United States’ establishment of military bases; this proves that we have the foundation for friendly cooperation. After frequent interaction, then we can further our relationship of friendly cooperation.Exactly because of [the above] point, just then I suggested another sixth point. We understand the feelings of the peoples and governments of small countries; we are willing to pay additional attention, because this can only be beneficial and not detrimental. In the past, China once invaded other countries during the old imperial era; for example east to Korea and south to Vietnam, and there was once conflict with Burma. Of course, in the past China was also once invaded by others. All of this has already passed. Now the new China does not tolerate this kind of invasive policy, [we are] even opposed to this kind of thought. We enthusiastically hope that the countries around us become strong and that [we can] get along with them peacefully; this is beneficial to peace in Asia and the world.To [sum it up] in a sentence, after many interactions, Burma will understand that although China is a large [country] with a large population, it is easy to get along [with China]. Our two countries are both Eastern peoples with relations of relatives; I believe [we] will get along very well. If difficulties do arise between us, then it can be solved immediately through diplomatic relations. If we pay attention to each other then there won’t be matters that cause misunderstanding. U Nu: I am very happy to hear what your Excellency has just said. Your Excellency’s trip this time is very effective and eliminated a large portion of the Burmese people’s fear towards China. Suppose if our first meeting can eliminate this much fear then the more interaction the more fear eliminated. Exactly for this reason, a year ago, I extended an invitation to your Excellency’s ambassador; inviting your Excellency to visit Burma. Later on, when our minister [responsible] for land nationalization visited China, I told him to extend the invitation to your Excellency. He returned and said that, your Excellency told him that it might be possible after the ceasefire of the Korean [War]. Now it has finally been realized. Also exactly because of the same reason, I am happy that your Excellency, on the way to the presidential palace, invited me to visit China. I am currently seriously considering this invitation. After I receive the authorization from the cabinet, I will inform your Excellency by letter. Suppose if I were to go to China then I want to mention a request which is, after I visit various important cities as arranged by the Chinese government, the two of us should go on a trip to Yunnan. This is because if any disputes were to occur [between China and Burma] then it will begin in Yunnan. Nehru and I have done this before. In the border between India and Burma, there is an area inhabited by tribes, this kind of tribe is called [text illegible] Liang (transliteration), a part of them lives within India and another part of them lives within Burma. Nehru and I once went to see these two areas together. Zhou Enlai: Regarding requests by visiting guests, we will of course attempt to satisfy [them].U Nu: Thank you. I am never willing to say negative words about others. However the communist party within our country is not as intelligent as the Chinese communist party. Actually they should know that if they continue to conduct [text illegible] with the government then that will only push the government more towards the United Kingdom and the United States. Because with continued fighting, the government will need arms and we can only purchase arms from the United Kingdom and the United States. If they continue to conduct sabotage then the government will require funds and equipment for reconstruction. Which in turn, funds and equipment can only be obtained from the United Kingdom and the United States. If it wasn’t for our resolute independent policy, we would have inclined towards the United Kingdom and the United States long ago. Not long after we obtained independence, and at that time the communist party has not stirred up trouble yet; the United Kingdom and the United States once sent representatives to ask us if we need assistance. We replied and said, if there is a need, we will pay, we cannot accept gifts. We have a lot of resources; we can use resources for exchanges. However, after the communist party started to attack, the situation changed. We needed arms and other things. Actually when the communist party conducts attacks, it is not the government that suffers, instead it is the people that suffer. The communist party bombs trains and rob villages. They will never be able to obtain power through this kind of method. I do not know what kind of assistance you can provide for us in this regard. However, the Burmese communist party respects the Chinese communist party very much. If you utter a sentence, they will listen.Zhou Enlai: (Laugh) Then that will become interfering with [others] internal affairs.U Nu: We welcome this kind of interference in internal affairs. Zhou Enlai: I said just then that after Burma obtained independence, [Burma] was unwilling to become a military base for foreign interventionists, [Burma] was unwilling to accept conditional aid. Towards [all of] this we feel admiration. Your Excellency once said that oppositional parties can bring forth opinion in elections and have the people make decisions; this is the principle of democracy. We are willing to see the country friendly to us become an independent, democratic, united and free country. According to the democratic principle mentioned by your Excellency, I believe that the internal issue within Burma can be solved. When I am saying all of this, I am speaking with the identity of a relative and a neighboring country; other than expressing friendliness there is no other meaning. Your Excellency said just then that there is no place to obtain arms, there is trade between China and Burma, and we can sell arms to you without condition. However, this will cause the United States to say that China wants to create a “Guatemala” in South East Asia, which will cause you difficulties. U Nu: Yes and not only so, there are other difficulties. Our army received British training; if we purchased arms from China then we have many things that will require drastic changes. Our position is very special. You only need to consider the issue of whether or not the United States will intervene, if the United States won’t intervene then everything will be well. Whereas we need to consider revolt from all sides, [revolt] by the communist party, [revolt] by Karen people, [revolt] by Kachin people, in addition to harassment by the Guomindang army.Zhou Enlai: I have already said, policy of the revolution must be appropriate to local needs; it must be able to grow on the soil of the native country. This is the experience of the Chinese communist party. We once had failures before, although we obtained success now, but we will never forget the experience from past failures. U Kyaw Nyein: I have once seen some [text illegible] regarding the mistake of Li Lisan’s path. Later Chairman Mao entered the farm village and made peasants the foundation for strategic purposes. The Chinese communist party possesses their own experience, they did not plagiarize others. Zhou Enlai: The issue is to rely on the largest number of people; it is not yet a strategic issue. The Chinese communist party is very against plagiarizing; therefore we once had a rectification movement. Regarding this aspect, we also have many documents for viewing. I want to ask about the situation of the Guomindang army, we are willing to know what other difficulties the Burmese government has regarding this aspect. If Prime Minister U Nu finds it inconvenient, [you] may say nothing. U Nu: I can answer this question. When they were here in the past, we once reported to the United Nations; the United Nations decided they should pull out of Burma, but they did not comply. Therefore, we sent the army to fight with them, and then they escaped to Thailand. However there are some that secretly slipped back in. There are about seven thousand people that were pulled out of Burma. These people can’t fight at all, they cannot beat anyone; they are only good at smuggling opium, robbing villages and raping women. Zhou Enlai: They have already become professional bandits, but the United States is still using them. What is the attitude of Thailand on this issue? [Thailand] should be helping Burma, but Thailand seems to be helping the Guomindang army instead. U Nu: No, Thailand is still helping us. Thailand agreed to be a member of the troop withdrawal committee. They are doing what they can to pull as many Guomindang troops out of Burma. Zhou Enlai: After the Guomindang army was withdrawn to Thailand, what was the attitude of Thailand? U Nu: These Guomindang troops are a threat to Thailand as well. Thailand cannot handle them because Thailand has internal disputes within their own country. Thailand’s army is not as strong as ours. Zhou Enlai: Are there Guomindang troops in the north eastern mountain areas in Burma which are inhabited by minority peoples? It was said in the past that they committed robbery there. U Kyaw Nyein: According to our intelligence, there are not many Guomindang troops in the Kachin people area. They are mainly in the southern part, where Burma and Thailand meets. There are not many of them in the border region between China and Burma. Zhou Enlai: Guomindang troops are Chinese, we are also very sad by how they trample the Burmese people. Our People’s Liberation Army rushed to the border too slowly; otherwise it would have saved Burma a lot of trouble. \n",

The Syrians agreed in principle with this [liaison work] with Korea.Note: we would like to note the emphasis added by the Korean diplomat on the ‘party and state’ nature of the visit to Syria of Pak Seong-cheol’s, given that until now, no party visit to Damascus has taken place.We think that the responsiveness displayed by the Syrians towards the party and state liaison actions with the People’s Republic of China and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea reflect Damascus’ interest in expanding its sphere of relations with socialist countries and in balancing Syria’s relations with these [socialist] countries in Europe and Asia.SignedEmilian Manciur\n",

      "On February 23rd, Vietnamese Ambassador Cao Kien Thiet visited me, and provided me with the following information about the latest steps of Korean diplomacy:In mid-February, Kim Il Sung gave an interview to a correspondent of AFP, in which he declared that the Non-Aligned Movement should return to its original objectives, and keep a distance from both blocs. He called for the withdrawal of foreign troops from every country. In the view of the Vietnamese, this is an anti-socialist standpoint, and actually it shows submission to the Western efforts. Even the Western observers are of the opinion that this standpoint is directed against the Soviet Union and Vietnam. Now the DPRK has launched a campaign to obtain the position of vice-chair in the [Non-Aligned] Movement as a representative of the Asian continent, after the summit to be held in New Delhi. Vietnam is of the opinion that if the Koreans [manage to obtain] this position, they will start undermining the Non-Aligned Movement from within, and this will endanger the unity of the movement. They called the Soviet Union’s attention to this issue, and also suggested that they should jointly choose and support some other candidate in order to offset the [efforts of the] Koreans. (Vietnam itself is also applying for this position.)All this indicates that—in contrast with the rumors that are also fueled by the Koreans—there has not been yet any substantial change in the policies of the DPRK.The ambassador said that the relationship between Korea and Vietnam was bad. Although Vietnam continues to consider the DPRK a socialist country, the line of the Korean Workers’ Party is contrary to Marxism-Leninism. This is indicated, among others, by the dynastic step taken by Kim Il Sung who has already selected his successor in the person of his son.China and the DPRK are in cahoots with each other against Vietnam, which continues to cause difficulties to Vietnam.The so-called “Cambodian question,” and the Korean standpoint adopted on this issue, creates a conflict between Vietnam and the DPRK.The Korean leadership is still unable to comprehend how Vietnam could gain a victory over American imperialism without the ideas of juche. This generates jealousy in the Korean leaders, and at the same time they must take into consideration that the ordinary people in Korea will contemplate that Vietnam has managed to reunify the country even without the ideas of juche.[…]   [signature](ambassador)\n",

      "The ambassador of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to Guinea recently visited Nigeria. The purpose of his visit was to investigate whether it would be possible to establish official relations between Nigeria and the DPRK. The ambassador paid no visits to the fraternal ambassadors; he cooperated solely with the ambassador of the People’s Republic of China, and used the latter’s car. On the fifth day of his visit in Lagos, he unexpectedly visited the comrade Soviet ambassador, and asked him to help him in arranging an official visit to the FM [Foreign Ministry] of this country. [The Nigerians] informed the comrade Soviet ambassador that the Chinese ambassador had already made such a request to the FM, and they told him that they could not meet the ambassador of the DPRK. Finally the comrade Soviet ambassador managed to arrange that the ambassador be unofficially received by the head of the Main Department of Asian Countries. Following his visit in the FM, the DPRK ambassador departed from Nigeria without paying a visit to the Soviet ambassador; he merely sent his interpreter to inform the comrade Soviet ambassador. During the unofficial conversation in the FM, the head of the Main Department of Asian Countries stated that for the time being, it was out of question to recognize the DPRK.According to the interpreter, the conversation was of a very formal and reserved nature.[illegible signature]\n",

The United States of America is introducing increasing quantities of weapons, which aggravates the danger of a conflict breaking out in the peninsula.

Given the active American presence in the Peninsula, the Korean matter is no longer a regional problem, but an international problem on whose resolution peace in Asia and in the entire world depends.In this context, it is necessary for all the peoples of the world to intensify their efforts to condemn the interference of the United States of America in the internal affairs of Korea, to follow closely and to actively support the just struggle of the Korean people, to take decisive actions with a view to turning the UN resolution on the Korean matter into reality.Signature: illegible\n",

      "Foreign Policy and International19 and 22 March 61Relations DepartmentBerlin, 14 March 1961ConfidentialDemocratic People's Republic of KoreaInformation on a few problems in the Korean Workers Party and in the Democratic People's Republic of China.(Prepared by the embassy of the GDR in the DPRK)Addressing the following issues:I. The influence of Chinese interpretations and theories in the DPRKII. Kim Il Sung's cult of personalityIII. The status of repatriation to the DPRK of the Koreans living in JapanI. The influence of Chinese interpretations and theories in the DPRK1. Corresponding to the Chinese theory of the national economy developing in leaps, our Korean comrades have also attempted to achieve Socialism in great leaps. The Korean version is the so-called “Ch'ollima” movement. As in China, the symbol for it is a winged horse on which a worker is mounted.Even after the publication of the Moscow declaration, there is talk of “new, even greater and more successful leaps” in reports on the satisfaction of the Five Year Plan and in the formulation of tasks for the Seven Year Plan.During the course of the Five Year Plan, this theory of leaps led to major disproportions in the national economy, just as it did in the People's Republic of China, and these disproportions were considered legitimate occurrences linked to the building of Socialism.2. Only in the last year there were measures implemented with the consent agreement of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers Party that amounted to over-centralizing the management of the national economy. Having eliminated nearly all of the ministries and established two super-committees for managing the national economy, now they are again undertaking to form ministries for the individual branches of the national economy.3. So-called “experimental economies” were created in two areas that include regions of up to 12,000 hectars, and they are organized in precisely the same manner as the Chinese people's communes.They have even begun to establish a type of urban people's commune, called Housewives Street Brigades, in that housewives and family members form so-called homeworker cooperatives that decide issues of production, societal life, and other things.4. The same managerial methods are applied in the army as in the Chinese army. The generals must serve as soldiers. There is no individual responsibility. Orders are decided in advance in the Party organization. The army is both a military unit and self-reliant in all areas. Chinese methods have been applied with even greater vigor, especially since the visit by the Chinese military delegation during the last months of last year.5. There is a strong orientation toward “black and yellow” brothers. This leads to violation of the principle of proletarian Internationalism, especially with regard to the importance of the struggle by the worker class in Europe and in other regions of the world. The roles of the Soviet Union and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union are still seriously underestimated and the role of the Communist Party of China is overestimated.II. Kim Il Sung's cult of personalityThe cult of personality surrounding Comrade Kim Il Sung has been growing steadily for some time. Everything the Party and the Korean people earn is attributed to Comrade Kim Il Sung. There is no room, no classroom, no public building in which a photo of Kim Il Sung cannot be found. The Museum of the War of National Liberation is designed entirely around the role of Kim Il Sung. There are no less than 12 figures of Kim Il Sung in the rooms of the museum, each larger than the next.The history of the revolutionary war and the formation of the Communist Party of Korea are not correctly portrayed. The decisive role of the Soviet Union in the liberation of Korea is completely downplayed. Its role is addressed on only a single panel. This is also expressed in the materials as well as in films and depictions. Thus, a legend of Kim Il Sung has been created that does not correspond to the actual facts if one considers what Comrade Kim Il Sung has actually done.Party propaganda is not oriented toward studying the works of Marxism/Leninism, but rather is solely and completely oriented toward the “wise teachings of our glorious leader, Comrade Kim Il Sung”. Many rules of Party life, such as the link to the masses, are portrayed as if they were discovered by Kim Il Sung rather than by Marx, Engels, and Lenin. There are almost no articles or events in which Comrade Kim Il Sung is not mentioned. It is also a fact that all of those who are not in agreement with such an approach are characterized as sectarians, and recently as revisionists. This demonstrates that criticism and self-criticism in the Party are very poorly developed and in many cases democratic rule is not guaranteed. This is particularly true of the army and state organizations.How the Korean Comrades view the fight against domination is evident from a statement by Comrade Pak Tin Tsches (spelling from original German document) which he made in his lecture at the 15th anniversary of the foundation of the KWP: “We as Korean comrades have always fought the battle against dogmatism, we have always pursued our own standpoint against that of others”. That is naturally a vulgar and false interpretation of the battle against dogmatism. Dogmatism in the Korean Workers Party is closely linked to the mystic ideas of Confucianism, which extend to certain nationalist tendencies. It is frequently stated that only a people like the Korean people is capable of such feats and heroism. All successes, not the least those achieved with the great assistance of the fraternal Socialist nations, especially with the aid of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people, are portrayed as their own successes. Great feats that were accomplished by the Soviet Union, the CSSR, Poland, and the GDR are portrayed as accomplishments of the Korean workers “without foreign” assistance. It is not coincidental that even after the Statement of the Communist and Workers Parties, neither international cooperation in all fields nor fraternal assistance from the Socialist nations were mentioned or shown any appreciation. Connected to this are also certain efforts not to take part in Socialist works and to underestimate the successes of other peoples in the Socialist camp. These nationalist tendencies are particularly prevalent in films, in the theater and performances, and in lectures.III. The status of repatriation to the DPRK of the Koreans living in JapanBy the end of 1960, the DPRK had sent 54 repatriation ships to Japan to bring about 53,000 Koreans back to the DPRK. 94% of them had lived in South Korea prior to emigrating to Japan. Among these Koreans are 700 specialists, 300 scientists and artists, 3 doctors of medicine, and 1 doctor in another field. In addition, this group includes 1500 Japanese who also emigrated to the DPRK. (These were primarily Japanese spouses.)By January 1961 there were markedly fewer announcements and reports on repatriations in the press and on the radio in the DPRK than there had been previously. On 3 February 1961 the Japanese Red Cross announced that the Red Cross of the DPRK had sent a telegram to its Japanese counterpart which read: “To prevent an epidemic of the flu that is in Japan, the repatriation transports are being temporarily suspended.” (Announcement in Vertr. Bulletin of the Ztak.)On 8 February 1961, the Tokyo-based Japanese broadcaster “International Radio” reported that the Japanese Red Cross had sent a telegram to the DPRK that contained the following:• Request for immediate dispatch of the 55th repatriation ship• There are 735 repatriates in Niigata, none of whom are ill with the flu• Proposal that the repatriates be provided prophylactic inoculations• Proposal that the DPRK send with the 55th ship physicians whose duties would be to conduct examinations and administer inoculations.The reasons the repatriation activities were halted are as follows:1. The repatriates who are already in the DPRK have sent word to those still living in Japan not to come to the DPRK due to the living conditions.2. Keeping track of the repatriates has proved difficult for DPRK organizations. For instance, our embassy has been able to observe that the younger repatriates, in particular, form groups and show up in Pyongyang, for example. They have their meeting points in the city and in some cases turn out to be “troublemakers”.3. Their clothing, attitude, and manner of personal appearance make them immediately recognizable in the DPRK. Some amenities that were commonplace for them in the past — portable radios, record players, etc., reach the Korean populace this way and lead to inconsistencies and complications in the education of the people, particularly the youth. (Tasks set forth for the youth at the last Central Committee meeting of the Democratic Youth Association: “Resolve difficult and complicated issues — Members of youth organization must be developed into “red soldiers of the Party”.4. The so-called Order Shops (purchasing centrals) currently offer items repatriates brought with them from Japan. Especially bicycles, portable radios, watches, leather jackets, suits, record players, leather purses, records, etc. These things are sold for cash to provide the so-called “material foundation” for the repatriates. Young repatriates in particular sometimes live up to six months on this money and do not pursue any regular employment. They use this time to make deals. This results in perceptible stimulation of the “black market” in the streets.5. The repatriates, settled by DPRK organizations across the entire country, even in the most remote villages, frequently leave, migrating primarily to major cities.6. There is dissatisfaction among the women repatriates, as well. In Japan, they were accustomed to having access to a broad range of products in shops and department stores, which is currently not the case in the DPRK.7. The independent Capitalists and former owners of small and mid-size businesses adapt best and most rapidly to life in the DPRK. The sale of the of the complete factory equipment they bring with them and models (machines, spare parts, cars, etc. gave them high profits and great advantages, such as top jobs.The specialists among the repatriates also fare well, since they are employed in accordance with their special knowledge and abilities. Repatriation has for the most part improved the lot of the farmers, since they were among the groups that suffered most in Japan. (High taxes, extremely poor living conditions.)Repatriation also brought with it a host of problems for the DPRK in terms of security and vigilance. Since the border between North and South Korea is hermetically sealed, the enemy attempts to infiltrate agents and spies, especially through Japan. The great number of those returning to the DPRK makes it easier for certain trained cadre from foreign intelligence services to penetrate. The possibility of taking personal property [illegible lines][illegible] the repatriates also provides an opportunity to introduce technical means of espionage and sabotage into the DPRK (portable radios as transmitters, etc.)This problem is not acknowledged publicly at all. The facts listed above are observations that have also been made by diplomats from other embassies and that have been confirmed in talks and meetings. \n",

      "In a discussion with Ionescu Teofil about the internal situation in North Korea and the significance of the repeated statements about the forthcoming ‘great revolutionary event’, the Vietnamese Minister-Counselor, Huang Mîoi, stated the following:‘Gathering from conversations with the North Koreans and from the remarks that the North Koreans made on various occasions, it can be concluded that the North Korean leadership is set on taking actions which will result in either the definitive solution of the Korean problem and the expulsion of American forces, or the acknowledgment of the existence of two Korean states through an international treaty, which would replace the current armistice. Given that the efforts undertaken until now to achieve these goals using political means had no results, this time a military path will be adopted, which in the current international context, would trigger a chain of political reactions to achieve the above-mentioned goals. If victory is achieved in Vietnam by democratic force, or if the conflict in Vietnam is ended by means of political [negotiations], with the condition of the withdrawal of American troops, then the plan is to launch a limited military conflict on the 38th parallel. Time-wise, this war will be unleashed at the time of the decision to withdraw American troops from Vietnam will have been taken, but shortly before the actual withdrawal will have begun.[’]The North Koreans are taking the following aspects into account:- The United States will be politically and militarily paralyzed, which would prevent it from getting involved in another war without having definitively resolved the current one. On the other hand, involvement in yet another conflict would taint the US in the eyes of the international public opinion, as the latter would conclude that this additional war was unleashed to satisfy the bellicose ambitions of the American administration, etc. Such an action would not enjoy too much support and sympathy externally, as the outcomes and denouement of the Korean War still endure in the memory of the US public opinion.In other words, the unleashing of a military conflict in Korea while the Vietnam War would be drawing to a close, would be met with widespread public condemnation from the international community, which would be set in motion to ask the immediate conclusion of this new war.It is also acknowledged that a settlement on the Vietnam issue would create the framework, basis and premises, including a precedent, for the immediate resolution of the conflict in Korea, without taking the proportions [of the Vietnam War].The North Koreans are also aware that reigniting the conflict in Korea would mean the resumption of hostilities between UN forces and Korean-Chinese forces, which would affect all UN member-states, and this organization overall, which is currently characterized by a different atmosphere and mindset, compared to the 1950s.  This situation would create a premise for discussing from the outset the Korean issue within the Security Council and within other UN bodies, which would attract the attention of the international public opinion and would create the framework for solving the Korean matter with the consent of both socialist and Third World countries. The approach adopted at the last two UN sessions on the Korean issue points in this direction.On the other hand, China would find itself compelled to intervene on the North Korean side so as to respect its old commitments as well as to defend its own political interests. Korea would not create the type of obstacles that China has encountered in Vietnam, given that China [in the Korean case] will have to intervene, and the USSR has already given North Korea the necessary military aid, which it could continue to supply since there is a common border between the DPRK and the USSR.In addition, the Vietnamese diplomat showed that in case the envisioned conditions won’t create the desired premises, the North Koreans could terminate the conflict, given its limited scale, through bilateral contacts within the armistice accord framework and with the consent of the great powers, especially the USSR.With respect to the issues discussed at the beginning of the conversation, the Vietnamese diplomat expressed his belief that presently the North Koreans were only preparing the domestic and international public opinion. The domestic public is used to the thought that this conflict will eventually take place and that its responsibility is to be morally and militarily prepared. The international public opinion is enticed by emphasizing the tensions on the 38th parallel, the fact that the US is delivering modern weaponry to South Korea etc. The North Koreans are aiming at portraying the US as planning the resumption of the war in Korea, given the preparations it is making. While military preparations in the North intensify and Soviet military aid reaches its destination, the South will undertake measures to step up the import of weaponry and to increase the level of military preparedness. This situation would make the job of North Korean propaganda significantly easier.The Vietnamese diplomat expressed his belief that Kim Il Sung and Kim Il had discussed these issues in Moscow and it seems that they had received guarantees that the USSR would grant them all its moral and material support.Moreover, the Vietnamese diplomat implied that in one form or another Kim Il Sung referred to these issues during his visit to Bucharest. He wanted to find out why Kim Il Sung had gone straight to Bucharest from Moscow and what kind of issues were discussed [in Bucharest].Ionescu Teofil replied that he was aware of Kim Il Sung’s visit to Bucharest, but that he did not know the details of the conversation.Note The Vietnamese Minister-Counselor is known to be a serious diplomat, who doesn’t make puerile speculations. He has frequent contacts with North Korean decision-makers and other officials, he travels considerably to take part in actions honoring North Korea’s solidarity with the struggle of the Vietnamese  people and the aid granted by the DPRK to Vietnam.Signed: N.

      "The main purpose of the unofficial visit that North Korean Vice-President Pak Seong-cheol paid [to Pakistan] on March 10-13th was to dissuade the new Pakistani leadership from re-examining Pakistan’s previous standpoint on the issue of Korean unification. Our North Korean friends anxiously monitor South Korea’s advance on the [Indian] subcontinent, which is indicated by the elevation of Sri Lankan-[South Korean] diplomatic relations to the ambassadorial level. According to the leaked news, Kim Il Sung’s message called the Pakistani leadership’s attention to that South Korea, with American support, was making preparations to launch a war on the DPRK, and asked for Pakistan’s mediation to prevent that.In confidential conversations, the Pakistani side confirmed that despite the removal of Bhutto from power, they do not intend to make changes in the bilateral relations between Pakistan and the DPRK, and they will maintain the friendly relationship. Despite the American pressure, they will not modify the status of the South Korean diplomatic mission from consulate-general [to embassy]. In the question of Korean reunification, they support the North Korean efforts “to create a unified Korea under the leadership of Kim Il Sung,” which are based on the resolutions of the UN. According to the information available to Pakistan, the United States was not making preparations to start a new military conflict on the Korean Peninsula, because this would halt the Sino-American rapprochement.The Pakistani government asked North Korea to intensify its efforts to rearm the Pakistani armed forces, and increase its arms shipments—small arms and anti-armor weapons.According to journalists, they were given such a promise [by the DPRK].In sum: The Pakistani military leadership linked the continuation of its political support to the DPRK to the increase of arms shipments from North Korea. Pak Seong-cheol’s visit was given unusually great publicity. Up to now, the DPRK ambassador has made only very general statements about the purpose of the visit; he neither refuted nor confirmed the information we had obtained about the objective of the visit.

      "In a discussion with Ionescu Teofil, the Soviet Minister-Counselor remarked that the current preparations for the forthcoming revolutionary event in the DPRK have the following goals: a. Distracting the attention of the masses from economic problems b. and their material situation. Military mass training establishes the regimentation of almost all people and is aimed at keeping the population under rigorous military discipline.c. Covering up the mistakes of the North Korean leadership made in the field of economic development, and their recent failures, which they justify as efforts and sacrifices made so as to strengthen national defense. The current campaign and especially the intensification of the presupposed war preparations of the South Koreans and the Americans are used to justify the sacrifices which the North Koreans have made for the strengthening of the DPRK abilities to defend itself.     d. In addition to this propagandistic dimension, the North Koreans are also emphasizing on the country’s multilateral military preparation. The Soviet diplomat mentioned that the North Koreans believed the current international situation created the conditions for solving the Korean problem.The Romanian diplomat tried to obtain more details on what these ‘conditions’ meant, assuming that the USSR and the DPRK had discussed this matter, and on what the Soviet Union would do in case of an armed conflict. The answer he received pointed out that the Korean delegation which visited Moscow had justified its request for military assistance by underlining the preparations undertaken by the Americans, without mentioning anything about North Korean intentions. The North Korean side was assured that in case of an attack, it would receive the material and political support of the USSR.Signed: N. Popa27 III/14.\n",

      "[…]Honourable Minister of Foreign Affairs | Ambassador Ushiroku Observations on the Management of North Korea Issues (I) No. 455 SecretOutbound No. 379The travels of Chongryon-associated Koreans (Chōsenjin) to North Korea have recently provided an opportunity to acknowledge where the issues lie, and how deep they are, in regards to contact between North Korea and Japan. I take this opportunity to provide for your reference my thoughts on contact between Japan and North Korea, particularly the contact of domestic Chongryon-related elements with North Korea.Firstly, I believe that there should be a fundamental distinctions be made between our contact with North Korea and our contact with Communist China.1.\tThat is to say that while there are still the usual arguments in regards to Communist China, they have seized legitimacy through their UN membership. We have ended formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan and proclaimed that it is our basic policy to pursue formal relations with Communist China. Given this, contact with Communist China that follows this basic policy will, on the one hand, necessarily increase pressure and difficulty on Taiwan or be conducted at their expense. In other words, this policy would in effect be pursued “AT THE PRICE OF TAIWAN.”  At the same time, this is our chosen course of stern and realist diplomacy, and as such we should not continue to take into consideration the injustice of the above. In addition, at this point it appears that Taiwan is prepared to endure heavy burdens.2.\tAlthough the case of Vietnam is slightly different, under the name of Vietnamization, the United States is attempting to maintain the barest minimum in order to save some face. Mirroring the phrase, “après moi le déluge,” the troops have been withdrawn leaving no trace.  For this reason, it is doubtful to all parties involved whether or not South Vietnam can continue to be a viable nation while also retaining its current qualities and identity.3.\tTo summarize, among Asia’s divided nations, it is difficult to deny that China and Vietnam strongly carry the potential for there to be a situation where “The East Wind Prevails Over the West Wind,” or some other similar situations. In contrast with the above, the situation of the Republic of Korea is completely different from that of countries like Taiwan.AFollowing the UN resolution on the establishment of Republic of Korea and the attitudes taken when Korea was officially recognized by various countries, including the Japan-Republic of Korea Treaty, in terms of international law the Republic of Korea is a state limited to the south of the Peninsula; notwithstanding their moral claim to the entire Korean Peninsula. To put it differently, even if North Korea were to improve its international position in the future, unlike the situation of Taiwan, North Korea would not replace the Republic of Korea’s international  position. Even if the state of affairs proceeded in the best possible manner for North Korea, it would still result in international recognition of North-South coexistence, like the German ‘One Nation, Two States.’ Similar to the situation for West Germany, considering the factors, such as the Republic of Korea’s population, geographical area, and position in international society,  there is more potential for a situation where “The West Wind Prevails Over the East Wind.” It is clear that North Korea will not replace the position of South Korea. In other words, there is no reason to be concerned that the North will grasp legitimacy. As long as this is the case, and barring the North’s use of force or unification through violent revolution, the replacement of international positions is an impossibility.For this reason, our work to enhance contact with the North requires neither concern about an eventuality where the positions of North and South Korea may become replaced, nor concern that such contact is carried out at the expense of the South. We should proceed with ample consideration paid to our ally, the Republic of Korea’s position, but without guilt. We should also be prepared to not be swayed by some domestic elements that claim that ‘North Korea is next.’ They wrongly draw analogies between the Korean Peninsula and the totally dissimilar cases of China and Vietnam. Concerning North Korea, our acceptance of Republic of Korea is certainly not a losing bet.4.\tEnhancing our contact with North Korea would contribute towards decreasing tensions in the region. If tensions were to increase such that it risked war on the Korean peninsula, that would present the greatest threat to our national interest, and it would necessitate our complete dedication to decreasing tensions. However, at this time the Republic of Korea has neither the capacity nor confidence to invade the North. Similarly, notwithstanding their true intentions, the North is also subject to an international environment that favors peace. Therefore, it appears that at this time there is an absence of serious and imminent tensions that might concern our national security. From the standpoint of our national security, it is sufficient if our measures to decrease tensions with North Korea simply follows the general trend of detente. We should not pursue, so called, detente so diligently that it causes difficulty for our ally, the Republic of Korea, or that it leads to distancing between Japan and South Korea.5.\tEven with the basic understanding as described above, détente with North Korea is more likely than not to be at the level of gesturing, rather than one coming from a deep consideration of domestic politics. Be that as it may, implementing détente with North Korea must reflect the above described basic understanding of the situation and be free of flirtation with North Korea. Furthermore, when we are determining the pace (or interval) and timing of such measures, we must do so while being truly an ally to the Republic of Korea and pay close attention to their position and the possible psychological impacts that détente may have. As a neighboring country, we must be more sympathetic to the Republic of Korea, especially since they are worried that their importance may be waning since the Nixon Doctrine and the thawing of Sino- American relations. (The Unite States decision to defer the issuance of passports for North Korea is an object lesson to this point.)The Red Cross dialogue may serve as a sort of benchmark for when thinking about the pace and timing. In the Red Cross example, care must be taken as to not outshine and deflate the diplomatic measures of the Republic of Korea by going much deeper than surface level détente vis-à-vis North Korea. This would also provide invaluable data on reading the atmosphere ahead of the upcoming discussion and deliberation on the Korea issue at the UN General Assembly.\n",

      "Top Secret Document 284Ministry of Foreign Affairs Top Secret FileRecord of Second Conversation of Premier Zhou Enlai and President Ben Bella(Premier has yet to review and approve)Time: Morning, 31 March 1965 Place: Villa Joly, the Algerian Presidential Palace Summary of ContentsPremier Zhou: 1) once again analyzed the outlook for the development of the situation in Vietnam and clarified our position of uncompromising opposition to US aggression and support for the Vietnamese people’s struggle; 2) exposed the truth of the Soviet Union’s false anti-imperialism and real surrender on the Vietnam issue; 3) explained our point of view and attitude on the principles that we should follow for the Second Asian-African Conference, the basis for the work during its preparatory period, and the issue of the Soviet Union’s inability to participate in the conference; and 4) further clarified our position regarding the United Nations. Ben Bella: 1) explained the reason that Algeria conveyed U Thant’s proposal to China; 2) explained Algeria’s position in support of the Vietnamese people and proposal to sound out a resolution of the Vietnam issue; 3) introduced the recent state of affairs in Africa, such as the situation in Congo (Brazzaville), relations between Algeria and Morocco, the Nouakchott Conference convened on 10 February, and the attitude of Tunisia, Morocco, and Libya regarding the issue of arming Israel; and 4) asked regarding our point of view on the function of the United Nations, the position of the Soviet Union on the Vietnam issue, and the results of Kosygin’s visit to Vietnam. (Exchange of greetings omitted)Ben Bella (hereafter simplified as Ben): May we now start our work? If you agree, I would like first to raise issues of which the Premier spoke yesterday. First of all, I would like to explain the situation behind our desire to convey U Thant’s proposal to China. United Nations Secretary-General U Thant, through our country's representative at the United Nations, requested that our country convey to you his proposal. We have already told you the content of the proposal. The reason that U Thant requested that our country convey it is that he and some other countries think that our country has a favorable impression of China’s policy (Premier Zhou interjected: This is correct.). At that time, we decided that we had the obligation to convey this to China. It is for you to decide as to the attitude you adopt. I have told your ambassador that Algeria's position is not neutral and that Algeria stands on your side and on the side of the Vietnamese brothers. I have also said that, if you think that this proposal is no good, we can express to U Thant our refusal to convey it. We simply convey this to you. Letting you know may be useful. We think it necessary to speak clearly of matters. Now I would like to say a few words about the issue itself. We, too, feel that an unconditional ceasefire is inconceivable, as it would be tantamount to destroying the morale of the fighters of the National Front for the Liberation of Southern Vietnam and allowing the imperialist conspiracy to prevail. For the resolution of this issue, we think that there may be two ideas. One is as Your Excellency the Premier said yesterday: the idea of having four steps or four phases. We think that it also possible to envision adding a phase. We do not think that the situation’s development will stop at the fourth phase but could develop to a fifth phase, leading to world war. We also believe that US imperialism could not obtain victory in a world war, but a great war could take place and the world would suffer destruction. Moreover, in the fifth phase, after much fighting there will still need to be a ceasefire, because in war it would be impossible to go on fighting ceaselessly. By that time, a ceasefire would already be simple. If we do not want the situation to develop to the fifth phase, then attempting a ceasefire in the second or third phase ceasefire requires having a proposal for a resolution. Of course, when conceiving a proposal, we must take into consideration the victory of the National Front for the Liberation of Southern Vietnam. We wish to cite our own example, which, of course, is not exactly identical. We did not achieve total military victory in Algeria's struggle against France. We only contained the French forces. Because of this we considered compelling France to accept a resolution and such a way also would have let us obtain power. We arranged a ceasefire. Following the ceasefire, we established a Provisional Executive. This Provisional Executive was not a revolutionary organization. Later, to enable the victory of the Revolution, it was necessary to establish a revolutionary regime and abolish the Provisional Executive and the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic [GPRA]. The GPRA at the time was unable to resolve the issue of the Algerian Revolution’s destiny. My reason for speaking a bit about this is to make clear our talk. Our conclusion is that, whatever the development of the war, whatever phase it reaches, the fourth phase or the fifth phase, in the end the National Front for the Liberation of Southern Vietnam must obtain power. Certainly, we cannot exclude imperialist scheming. Imperialism may exploit this or that country, going so far as U Thant’s proposal. If you have any proposal, you can tell us. We simply want, at a certain time, when Algeria can play a role, to play a useful one. We are not neutral. We have an obligation to play a role. What is important is that, no matter what, we must always enable the armed forces of the National Front for the Liberation of Southern Vietnam to survive and obtain power. We forever stand on the side of the National Front for the Liberation of Southern Vietnam. Our attitude is the same as yours, we think it necessary to listen to the views of the National Front for the Liberation of Southern Vietnam. We stand on their side. As for the outlook for the war in Vietnam, we do not think that the United States will be able to resolve the issue with one or ten divisions. First of all, it is because the National Front for the Liberation of Southern Vietnam is determined to fight. If people in one country are determined to fight, no force can stop them from gaining liberation. Such was Algeria's situation at the time. During the war, France had 800,000 troops in Algeria, not 500,000, with 200,000 in the Department of Algiers alone. Algeria lies only 800 kilometers away from the French city of Marseille (it takes only an hour to fly there by jet aircraft). However, the Algerian people were determined to fight to rid themselves of colonial rule. We believe that the Vietnamese people are determined to fight. Whether one, two or three US army divisions, whether the war develops to the third, fourth or fifth phase, nothing can stop the Vietnamese people from gaining victory and power. This is our view on the future of south Vietnam. As we are frank with one another, I propose to raise this question: Supposing that the United States continues to take steps to enter into the third phase, going into north Vietnam, expanding the war, and even occupying north Vietnam, do you not know the attitude and action that the Soviet Union may take? What were the concrete results of [Alexei] Kosygin’s visit to Vietnam? I first raise this issue. Later, we also have to discuss some minor issues. Zhou: I thank Your Excellency the President for frankly telling us your point of view. We have no misunderstanding regarding your conveying to us the proposal of U Thant. We fully understand that the President’s position is well-intended and cooperative. We decided before visiting Europe that we would afterwards visit Algeria and discuss some issues, so we did not respond to Your Excellency by telegram regarding U Thant's proposal. What is regrettable is that there was no change in the time that we had decided for visiting Romania, but Comrade [Gheorghe] Gheorghiu-Dej passed away. As a result, the visit turned into attending his funeral. As for the background to U Thant's proposal, I do not intend to add to the speculation. This is conceivable. Perhaps this is something he himself put forth, or someone else agreed with it. This is not important. Recently, U Thant expressed his desire to visit China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam if China and Vietnam both agreed. At present, international relations are tense, complicated, and delicate. Therefore, there are bound to be some persons who want to conduct various activities. There is nothing strange about this. For example, recently, the British prime minister, too, proclaimed that he wanted to send former foreign secretary [Patrick] Gordon Walker, who lost his seat in parliament [in 1964], as an envoy of the British foreign secretary to visit Hanoi and Beijing. At present it is quite natural to conduct activities in taking this or that position. With the development of such events, such activities will surely increase. Of course, among these is one that the United States needs, which is to probe for the United States. I already talked about this point yesterday. As we understand it, the United States is still not prepared to fight a major war. Therefore, at every step it will extend its tentacles and probe. Therefore, we will explain a bit more clearly the background to our Algerian brothers and Algeria’s leaders so that when they run into such a situation they can handle it. Whether it is U Thant or other persons probing, there is a fundamental issue that requires explanation. 1) Just as Your Excellency the President has said, we must respect the determination and stance of the Vietnamese people. The National Front for the Liberation of Southern Vietnam has representatives in our country. We maintain regular contact with them. 2) Any activity related to the Vietnam issue first of all requires seeking the views of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Vietnam Workers’ Party. This is our position. Algeria’s leaders readily understand this. In the past, the GPRA had representation in Beijing. We regularly sought their views. We later learned that there was a struggle between your revolutionary faction and the GPRA. We were relatively late in learning of this. After the President returned to Algeria, the GPRA issue was resolved. It was at this time that an Algerian youth delegation arrived in Beijing. Mao Zedong received them and said to them that in the past we had received many Algerian delegations, many of which later turned into rightists or bad elements. We gradually are coming to understand these situations. We fully trust President Ben Bella. In late 1963, Marshal Chen Yi and I came here to visit. Your Excellency the President and other brothers told us in detail of the situation and made us understand more clearly your situation at that time. Algeria is far from our country. In the past our understanding of the development of many situations insufficient, nor did we seek more ways to understand it. This a shortcoming in our work. Of course, objectively, too, there are certainly difficulties. Vietnam is a neighbor of China. We have a relatively clear understanding of Vietnam. We have an obligation to introduce the situation to all of you brothers here. The most important expression of the determination of the Vietnamese people is the National Front for the Liberation of Southern Vietnam’s statement of 22 March. This statement, with greater focus and concrete words, expressed the Vietnamese people’s determination to firmly oppose unconditional ceasefire negotiations. Your Excellency the President just said that Algeria stands on the side of the Vietnamese people and opposes unconditional ceasefire negotiations because unconditional ceasefire negotiations are tantamount to striking the morale of the Vietnamese fighters and allowing the imperialist conspiracy to prevail. We are in agreement on this issue. The Vietnamese people do not want to yield in the face of the bayonet and bombing. The President now proposes to study the possible development of the situation in Vietnam, believing that the development of the war will not change according to the will of US imperialism, that the war will not stop at the fourth phase, and that it may develop to the fifth phase -- world war. Of course, this possibility cannot be excluded, even though the United States is still not prepared. I wish to speak clearly. The so-called four phases are not plans that the United States has already prepared, but a type of estimate, conceived from the worst possibility so as to adopt the necessary measures. We are brothers and friends. We are willing to speak frankly to you of our ideas. The United States to this day still says that it has no intention of expanding the war to China. In early March this year at the Warsaw meeting between China and the United States, the US ambassador told our country’s ambassador that the United States was not prepared to expand the war in Vietnam, let alone thinking to expand the war to China. Why does the United States every time have to make such a statement and make public statements? Its objective is to isolate Vietnam. We responded to the statement of the National Front for the Liberation of Southern Vietnam. At that time it was expressed in the form of a newspaper editorial. The response of the United States was very intense. However, [Dean] Rusk still said that, although China responded to the statement of the National Front for the Liberation of Southern Vietnam and expressed its willingness to send people to help south Vietnam, would the Communist Party of China in the end send a volunteer army? The United States is always at a loss as to China’s intent. Rusk deliberately said that with the intent to make the Vietnamese people lose hope and to make south Vietnam yield to the US threat. Therefore, at present what we certainly can say is that what the United States can do now is to take the first step of sending three divisions to south Vietnam, of which two are US divisions and one is a division put together from vassal countries, have them go protect cities, airfields, ports and such, and transfer the puppet troops to go fight the armed forces of the National Front for the Liberation of Southern Vietnam. Yesterday, I also spoke a bit about the United States having three options in bombing north Vietnam: The first is the bombing of more than 20 targets in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam that are near south Vietnam. Among them are military bases, ports, depots, and such. At present, the United States has already carried this out. The second option is the bombing of eight industrial targets, including Hanoi and Haiphong. The third option is the bombing of 100 targets throughout Vietnam. At present the United States is taking action in three respects: sending troops to south Vietnam, bombing north Vietnam, and imposing a maritime blockade. All this falls within the first phase. As for the second phase and the fourth phase, which we speculate could develop, it is not a plan that the United States has already prepared. But the development of the situation has to do with China. At the same time the National Front for the Liberation of Southern Vietnam has expressed its determination and will. Therefore, we cannot but conceive of it. If we do not conceive of it, then we are not the brothers of the Vietnamese people. If we do not tell our Algerian brothers about what we have conceived, that would be wrong. If we met and we did not tell you about the situation, then if later such situations arose, you would not be prepared. We thus have this tentative idea in four phases, starting from our own position. We cannot drag in even more aspects or make even broader considerations. We have not only devised a tentative idea, but also made preparations, letting the United States know that what we are saying is not empty talk. In this way we may make the United States have even more misgivings when it wants to take action. At present, the United States each time it takes a step must then examine it. In 1950, it had not been a year since the liberation of our country. The United States then instigated a war in Korea. At the same time, the United States sent the 7th Fleet into the Taiwan Strait and declared the Taiwan Strait to be under the “protection” of the United States. However, we issued a warning, saying that if the United States crossed the 38th parallel and approached the Yalu River on China’s border, our country would be unable to ignore it. Not only this but, through the Indian ambassador [to China, M.M. Panikkar], we also told the United States that we stand by what we say. However, the government of the United States simply did not believe what we said, because we had just gained liberation. The result was that our country’s volunteer army crossed the Yalu and the United States was utterly surprised. After three and a half years of war, the United States failed and had to cease its fire. This went beyond the expectation of the United States. This is a reason for the so-called unwillingness of the United States to recognize China. In this Vietnam incident, we have given advance warning that we cannot ignore it if the United States were to expand the war into north Vietnam and all of Indochina. We have said that we have already prepared well for it, and we stand by what we say. However, the government of the United States deliberately played down the significance of our statement. They said that what we said was unreliable. Therefore, we think it necessary to tell the leaders of friendly countries our position: we are in fact well prepared. From our perspective, the United States at present has only four phases. After reaching the fourth phase, there are two possibilities. The first is turning it into a world war. The second is that the United States [text indistinct] China, cannot but seek a solution. As for the President’s mentioned fifth phase, I have already said that this cannot be excluded. The reason is that the United States is different from France. The United States is more powerful than France. It is attempting to dominate the world. In the United States, there is no one like [Charles] De Gaulle, someone capable of resolving to withdraw from south Vietnam. However, another possibility is one that the President can see. That is to say, whether in the second or third phase, the United States must meet and discuss matters with China. In each phase it must take into consideration the Chinese factor. Today’s China is no longer the China of the 1950s. We can also explain to the president that if the United States wants to expand the war and fight with China, we are determined to take full responsibility and absolutely not ask other countries, in particular socialist countries, to jointly assume responsibility. As early as 1958, when we made the decision to bomb Jinmen [Quemoy], Mazu [Matsu], and other islands, we informed Soviet Foreign Minister [Andrei] Gromyko. At the time, we knew that [John Foster] Dulles engaged in brinksmanship. He would not let us cross the Taiwan Strait. He was concerned that, after liberating Jinmen and Mazu, we would right away liberate Taiwan. In fact, we had no such plan. However, Dulles instead had Chiang Kai-shek withdraw from the coastal islands, attempting to cut off the Taiwan Strait from the Chinese mainland in order for the United States to completely control Taiwan and establish a so-called independent political entity. Our intent in bombing Jinmen was to pin down Chiang Kai-shek’s troops on these islands in order to take the opportunity to publicize his preparing to “counterattack” the mainland. At the time the Soviet Union sent Foreign Minister Gromyko to China to negotiate the issue. We told him about the entire situation, that we were only hitting the coastal islands, not going beyond the limit of China’s territorial waters or territorial air space, nor were we provoking the United States. At that time, we also understood that the US Department of Defense had ordered the US Navy and Air Force not to enter China’s territorial waters or territorial air space or to carry out provocations. Therefore, there was no possibility of something triggering a greater clash occurring. However, at that time we also prepared for the worst. If the United States attacked China, what would we do? We told Gromyko that if the United States forced war upon us, we alone would take responsibility for it. Despite China and the Soviet Union’s alliance relationship, we would not ask the Soviet Union to send troops. We think that doing it this way would be good. China hinders the United States. The Soviet Union is even more powerful and its voice is greater. The Soviet foreign minister felt that our attitude was both prudent and resolute, and he was greatly moved. As for this matter, I asked him whether or not he still remembered it when I went last year to the Soviet Union to participate in the October Revolution Day. He said that he still remembered it. I also told him that we still continue to support this position. In February this year, Kosygin visited Vietnam and Korea, stopping by China along the way. Once again I raised this matter, explaining that, even if the United States struck China, we would not ask the Soviet Union to take part in the war. This would be of greater benefit to the people of the world's various countries in their task of struggling against imperialism, in particular against US imperialism. Today, I formally and solemnly tell this to Your Excellency the President. Therefore, speaking from our perspective, the possibility of the fourth phase develop to the fifth phase is excluded. We absolutely will not on our own initiative expand the war. There is a common saying in China: It takes two to have a quarrel. The United States goes around spreading the propaganda that, if the United States attacks China, the Soviet Union will not enter the war because the Sino-Soviet conflict is too severe. The objective of the US propaganda is to make the Chinese people afraid that the Soviet Union would not enter the war and that China would lack the means to fight alone against the United States. Our position is that we absolutely will not provoke the United States. Taiwan is Chinese territory, yet we have not gone to fight. In Warsaw, the Sino-American ambassadorial–level talks have been going on for 10 years. Therefore, on our part, there fundamentally is no possibility of provocation. If the United States, placing its hope on the possibility of the Soviet Union not entering the war, has a major fight with China, then the United States must accept responsibility for all the consequences. We have spoken clearly of our determination. We are willing to envisage the worst and tell our friends about it. We envisage the United States possibly adopting only four steps. We also must block the outbreak of a world war. The President has mentioned that the war, whatever the phase to which it develops, cannot be fought forever and, in the end, it will be necessary to negotiate. This is correct. Algeria fought for seven and a half years and ultimately engaged in negotiations, France withdrew its military, and Algeria achieved victory. Yesterday, I previously said: First, we do not carry out provocations. Second, we do not completely oppose negotiations. We need not wait until the incident develops to the fourth phase to seek negotiations but should at each phase seek negotiations. The National Front for the Liberation of Southern Vietnam has already proposed negotiating conditions. They are: halt the US wrecking of the Geneva Accords, withdraw all the US military and weapons from south Vietnam, and let the Vietnamese people themselves resolve their own issues. The United States has proposed opposite conditions, calling first of all for a ceasefire, which is tantamount to forcing the Vietnamese people to lay down their arms so that the United States may exercise long-term control over south Vietnam and forcing north Vietnam to cease its so-called “invasion,” which is to say that north Vietnam would not be able to help the Vietnamese people. The logic of the United States is: the actions of the Vietnamese people are due to north Vietnam’s help and invasion. First of all, the ceasefire’s conditions simply can only benefit US imperialist control and disadvantage the south Vietnamese people’s struggle. On the initiative of Prince Sihanouk, at the Conference of the Indochinese People, held in Phnom Penh, the National Front for the Liberation of Southern Vietnam went so far as to express its attitude toward the issue of the south Vietnamese regime. It indicated that it could not recognize the south Vietnamese puppet regime, a tool of US imperialism to slaughter the south Vietnamese people. The National Front for the Liberation of Southern Vietnam is the representative of the south Vietnamese people. At present it has not yet announced the establishment of a provisional government. It envisions, other than the National Front for the Liberation of Southern Vietnam, striving for the participation of more patriotic persons in order to establish in the future a coalition government. Of course, in the future coalition government the National Front for the Liberation of Southern Vietnam must occupy the dominant position. Such a possibility follows the war’s development day by day. The conditions are maturing with each passing day. This is our fundamental point of view regarding the issue of south Vietnam. It is fundamentally close to the President’s point of view. As for supporting our south Vietnamese brothers, our position is identical. As for the conditions and timing of the negotiations, they are still not mature because the United States does not accept the just demands that the National Front for the Liberation of Southern Vietnam has issued. Unconditional implementation of ceasefire negotiations now would simply dampen the morale of the National Front for the Liberation of Southern Vietnam’s fighters and allow the US conspiracy to prevail. The National Front for the Liberation of Southern Vietnam is not at the present time anxious to organize a provisional government. It is prepared to fight for a time, continue to win in the struggle, rally more patriotic persons, and make the bogus regime further isolated and thus more easily overthrown. It is different from Algeria in this respect. Algeria very early established a provisional government and conducted negotiations with France. Just now the President asked about the attitude of the Soviet Union. I am willing to say frankly that the Soviet Union has a fundamental point of view, that we do not agree with it, and that our two sides have disputes. The Soviet Union believes that the United States is fearsome. We say that there is no use in being afraid. The more you are afraid, the more ferocious is imperialism. The Soviet Union fears the United States starting a major war and engaging in nuclear warfare. Speaking of it, this issue also is quite contradictory. The Soviet Union’s leaders have said that nuclear warfare would destroy the world and that in the end there would be no winner or loser. If so, then why would the United States also want to fight a nuclear war? The ruling group in the United States are monopoly capitalists who seek maximum profit. If they started a nuclear war, the world’s industry would be destroyed, the world’s labor force would be lost, and the international market would also be destroyed. Where is the maximum profit in that? Therefore, the United States itself also fears a nuclear war. It simply wants to scare people with nuclear warfare and thereby blackmail them and rule the world. The Soviet Union fears any minor war developing into a major war. However, based on the 20 years following the end of the Second World War, this has not been the situation. The Chinese civil war did not trigger a world war. New China was born from it. Nor did the Korean War turn into a major war. The Indochina War in the end resulted in an agreement. Nor has the Algeria struggle or the Cuban revolution become a world war. At present, the Taiwan Strait confrontation has not given rise to a major war and Africa’s many armed struggles have not given rise to a world war. Due to the Soviet fear that any minor war would turn into a world war, the Soviet Union has been very anxious regarding national liberation struggles, has feared that the people in various countries would rise and carry out armed struggles, and has feared people’s revolution. Its logic is to fear the United States, fear fighting, fear any minor war turning into a nuclear war, and so fear national liberation struggles and revolution. Their conclusion is that the United States and the Soviet Union cooperate to resolve the world’s issues, including arms reduction and nuclear testing. The issues of arms reduction, nuclear testing, and the United Nations, even those regarding UN troops, have fully demonstrated this point. The United States has seized on the weak point of the Soviet Union and used war to threaten it. Regarding any proposal of the Soviet Union, the United States attaches not importance to it, knowing that the Soviet Union’s central issue is peaceful coexistence. On the issue of south Vietnam, the Soviet Union protested to the United States and demanded the withdrawal of US troops.  The US ambassador to Moscow immediately sent it back. Thus, does the United States despise the Soviet Union. It is difficult for us, as a socialist country and ally, to regard such a situation. China’s power is much inferior to that of the Soviet Union, but a Chinese article, such as the editorial that we published on 25 March, attracted the attention of the United States. The United States can send back the Soviet Union’s official protest. I will first speak of the background and then talk about the attitude of the Soviet Union on the issue of Vietnam and about the results of Kosygin’s visit to Vietnam. Kosygin this year visited Vietnam and Korea and passed through China. We helped them out. We also had several talks with him. He indicated a desire to help Vietnam. We said, the more the better. He told us on his return from Vietnam that the Soviet Union wanted to give Vietnam weapons, including surface-to-air missiles, weapons for two regiments, anti-aircraft machine guns, artillery, light tanks, communications equipment, and MiG-17 aircraft. We told him that when the Soviet Union helped Vietnam, we could assist with transportation. All they have to do is give us the shipping list and, once the materials arrived at the border, we would immediately transport them. However, when Kosygin returned to Moscow, the first thing he did was to propose negotiations with the United States. He previously asked the view of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam’s government. Vietnam’s Prime Minister Pham Van Dong answered him on the spot, saying that Vietnam did not agree to negotiate under bombings and the bayonet and would absolutely not yield before imperialism. Later, the Soviet Union asked us. At that time, not knowing the attitude of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, we indicated our desire to ask the Vietnamese side their view. This was on 16 February. However, the Soviet Union, without taking into consideration the Vietnamese side’s opposition or waiting for China’s reply, contacted the French government on 23 February. The Soviet Union’s ambassador to France later told our ambassador to France that the French government’s attitude was the same as that of the Soviet government, that is to say, in regard to unconditional ceasefire negotiations. Therefore, we cannot but criticize the Soviet Union for their not taking into consideration the Vietnamese side’s view. It was wrong for them to contact France. Vietnam, too, was opposed to it. The Soviet foreign minister visited Britain and there proposed the “condition.” According to the internal state of affairs, the “condition” is that the United States has to halt the bombing of north Vietnam, not that the United States withdraw its troops. The Soviet foreign minister held a press conference. A reporter asked him about the Vietnam negotiations. Gromyko replied that they depended on the relevant parties. The reporter followed by asking who the relevant parties were. Gromyko replied that negotiations depended on the United States and north Vietnam. This is tantamount to placing the US aggressors and the Vietnamese people in the position of warring parties. Rusk was very pleased to hear it, immediately accepting the statement and saying that the United States accepted negotiations if the “Viet Cong” agreed to an unconditional ceasefire. That is to say, the United States understands very clearly the Soviet Union’s internal state of affairs. Originally, Kosygin went to Vietnam and promised to help Vietnam, and Vietnam clearly said that it could not accept negotiations. Once Kosygin left Vietnam, the first thing that he said was that the Soviet Union wanted to negotiate and only as a second step would it give its shipping list [of aid materials] to Vietnam and China. This was already near the end of February. The Soviet Union at that time also suddenly wanted to send troops to Vietnam to manage the missiles. Everyone here can envision the Cuban situation. Cuba’s surface-to-air missiles, too, until now have been unable to shoot at US aircraft because control of the missiles has been in the hands of Soviet military equipment personnel. China’s surface-to-air missiles can all strike U-2 aircraft because we ourselves control them. We have already shot down four U-2 aircraft. Vietnam has not requested that the Soviet Union send troops, but the Soviet Union wants to send 4,000 men. Vietnam is against it. We, too, are against it. As of the end of March, the Soviet Union finally cancelled the troop dispatch and decided to send the missiles and arms in early April. The Soviet Union proposed to us that we agree immediately to help with their transport. At present the foreign press is reporting that the Soviet Union will send surface-to-air missiles. The United States government has declared that, if the Soviet missiles hinder the operations of US aircraft, it will cause a severe incident to the detriment of the Soviets. The United States wants to scare the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union, having decided not to send troops, is opting instead to send 260 trainers. In fact, Vietnam already has a regiment in the Soviet Union learning how to use the missiles. It is entirely possible that the Soviet Union will not send trainers. Therefore, we must also see whether or not the Soviet Union sends the missiles. When we have definite results from this time forward, we can inform you of them via Ambassador Zeng Tao. When the Soviet Union handed us a list of aid to Vietnam, we learned that the Soviet Union would send an additional 12 MiG-21 aircraft to China. Vietnamese will not pilot the MiG-21 aircraft. Nor has Vietnam made a request for them. In fact, what use are the 12 aircraft? If they are for protecting China’s border, they can sell them to us. The Soviet Union wants to send the aircraft and 500 military personnel to China and, in effect, wants to control our country’s Kunming airport. The Soviet Union says that this is for training Vietnam’s air force personnel. The Vietnamese brothers say that, if they want to train, they can train in the Soviet Union, where it would be a little more peaceful. The Soviet Union has also said that in Kunming it would be possible to protect Vietnam’s political center, Hanoi. Flying from Kunming, however, the MiG-21 aircraft could only reach the Sino-Vietnamese border, with the other half of the flight distance to Hanoi still remaining. They think to control China this way, but they cannot. It therefore wants to send 4,000 men to Vietnam and 500 to China with the objective of scaring the United States and achieving its negotiating objectives. The Soviet Union, using the excuse of wanting to safeguard the future supplies to Soviet military personnel sent to Vietnam and China, wants to develop two air corridors in our territorial air space. This, too, is for the purpose of showing the United States and thereby bring about negotiations. If it were for the purpose of military operations, why did they not discuss it in advance with the Vietnamese and Chinese sides? Kosygin never mentioned it while he was in Vietnam and China, slipping it into the aid list. This is called smuggling. When we discussed it with Vietnam, Vietnam was very surprised. Afterwards, both Vietnam and China refused it. We told the Soviet Union not to send troops or aircraft here, but that we could help transport other military supplies.We are willing to tell you everything. During our discussions in Vietnam, the Soviet Union also let us know that they were about to ship 70 14.5 mm anti-aircraft machine guns and 18 SAM-3 anti-aircraft systems. Your defense minister knows the possible extent of these figures. The Soviet Union has also said that they want to use 45 Antonov An-12 aircraft to transport the materials immediately. You already know how many tons are involved. The objective of their wanting to use 45 transport aircraft is for informing the United States. In fact, we not only provide such an amount, but we can provide more than that. We have told the Soviet Union not to send aircraft and that the use of rail transportation can be kept secret. At that time, we immediately allocated 100 12.7 mm anti-aircraft machine guns and 66 SAM-3 systems. Nor does Vietnam agree with the Soviet Union’s way of doing it. We disagree with the Soviet Union going behind the back of Vietnam and China in taking action. The Soviet Union never gains the agreement of countries concerned, immediately taking action to scare the United States. If it fails, the Soviet Union will immediately turn 180 degrees and yield. The Soviet Union did this with the Cuban brothers. We have told the Soviet Union that the aid materials should be transported through China’s railways, that we can transport them as soon as they arrive and in whatever amount. By the end of March, the Soviet Union had cancelled the dispatch of troops, and the arms had only just arrived at the Sino-Soviet border. This shows that the general arms shipment was delayed a month. However, the Soviet Union has spread the word among many socialist countries and nationalist countries that China was not letting the Soviet Union’s military aid go through. The fact of the matter is what I have just said now. What Vietnam and China oppose is the Soviet Union sending aircraft and troops to conduct a military show of force. We do not agree with the Soviet Union’s desire to control China and Vietnam or make a military show of force to the enemy, or with its acting in advance without consulting us. There is also the situation of the Soviet Union carrying out activities in Asian and African countries, socialist countries, and international organizations and wishing to engage in a joint statement to “support Vietnam.” We have said that when an international organization wants to issue a statement in support of Vietnam, it must respect the views of the National Front for the Liberation of Southern Vietnam and of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. It should also be based on the following two documents: 1) The resolution of the international conference, held in Hanoi at the end of November 1964, to help the Vietnamese oppose US imperialist aggression and safeguard peace. Socialist countries, Asian, African and Latin American countries, and organizations of the world peace movement all participated in this conference. The adopted resolution expresses steadfast support for the Vietnamese people’s just struggle and makes no reference to peace talks.  At that time, Vietnam also did not agree to the reference to peace talks in the document. 2) Not long ago, Prince Sihanouk proposed the resolution of the Conference of the Indochinese People. In short, it raised the issue of the Indochinese people uniting against imperialism, referring separately to north and south Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, as well as specifically mentioning the conditions under which to conduct negotiations. We feel that all friendly countries supporting Vietnam must respect the Vietnamese side’s views, because only Vietnam itself understands at what opportune time and under what conditions it can conduct negotiations. Now the requirement is for friendly countries to support them in their struggle, so that they can support their morale and strike the vanguard of the US aggressors. Instead of engaging in a joint statement, various countries and work units can express their own will. In order to speak clearly about the facts and for the sake of mutual understanding, my talk took a very long time. This is completely an internal conversation. Ben: Your Excellency the Premier’s talk is very useful to us. Now, I will talk a bit about the issue of Congo (Brazzaville). Before [Fulbert] Youlou fled the country, Congo (Brazzaville) friends told us that Congo (Leopoldville) was making threats and that the situation in Congo (Brazzaville) was quite serious. They asked us for emergency military and financial help. They not only asked for help from Algeria, but from Mali, Guinea, and the United Arab Republic, and possibly from Ghana as well. They made an appeal for the provision of two billion old francs, equivalent to four million dollars, in financial assistance. There are many worrisome problems in Congo (Brazzaville), a large number of refugees have fled Congo (Leopoldville), and the social problems are extremely serious. As for military affairs, I have sent a delegation to Congo (Brazzaville). We are doing everything in our power to do what we can to help. As for financial assistance, Algeria lacks foreign exchange. In spite of our having tried thinking of every possible method, it is hard to satisfy them and it is hard for other African countries to provide assistance. I wonder whether you would be able to do something in this respect. Do you have an ambassador in Congo (Brazzaville)? (Premier interjected: We have sent an ambassador.). We think that they are worthy of help. This concerns the present regime in Congo (Brazzaville), whose opposition to imperialism in Africa is a positive factor. I am telling you frankly about this situation. You can make direct contacts via your ambassador. Zhou: We have provided financial and military assistance. I did not know that Youlou had fled. This incident is serious. Ben: It happened while you were travelling. According to reports, Youlou has appeared in Leopoldville. Zhou: This makes the situation more complicated. As for the issue of financial assistance, I will return to Beijing and discuss it. Whatever the decision, we will convey it via our ambassador to Your Excellency the President. Ben: (After a moment of silence) That is no problem at all. Zhou: Shall we talk a bit about the Second Asian-African Conference? Ben: Ah, the Foreign Minister has reminded me. Let us talk a bit again about relations between Algeria and Morocco. Recently, we have done our best to improve relations with Morocco. It is not that we fear Morocco, but that we are proceeding from an overall strategy. The example of Algeria’s Revolution is enough to bring about change in Morocco. However, if relations between Algeria and Morocco are tense, this could make Morocco turn to US imperialism. A relaxation in relations with Morocco, of course, cannot be at the expense of our revolutionary principles, interests or territorial sovereignty. We have told the Moroccan side that Algeria and Morocco can entirely develop their bilateral economic relations. Some days ago, we made several attempts to meet with Hassan II, who has always made harsh border demands. Recently, Hassan took the initiative to propose a meeting with me on 28 March. However, an incident took place in Morocco. In two days, Hassan II executed 14 persons and arrested two or three hundred. The 14 executed persons were revolutionaries who had come from Algeria. They had nothing to do with the demonstrations in Morocco. This is a new political factor. We think that it would not do in this situation to have the meeting. Meeting now would be tantamount to applauding them and giving Moroccan patriots the mistaken impression that we agreed with Morocco’s regressive domestic policy. We have nothing to do with their domestic problems. The original plan for my meeting with Hassan was for resolving the border issue. This can only be done in a clear atmosphere. At present, it is out of the question. I shall speak some more about several situations in Africa: 1. Sudan: Recently, imperialism has goaded southern Sudan to oppose the northern part of the country, doing its utmost to exploit Sudan’s tribal and religious difference. Many countries, such as Ethiopia, serve the imperialist conspiracy. We want to help the Sudanese friends ease the differences between southern and northern Sudan so that they may avoid exploitation by the imperialists. 2. Uganda: There, the forces of imperialism are relatively strong. There are still many British there. Uganda still has a positive attitude on the Congo (Leopoldville) issue. Uganda, which was recently attacked by [Moise Kapenda] Tshombe, wants our help. We have an obligation to help them. At present in Africa there has now emerged a new factor. The United States, beyond making use of Tshombe, also wishes to find other junior partners, and in particular wants to find tools from among the nations of the former French “Community.” Recently, at the Nouakchott Conference, the Ivory Coast’s [Felix] Houphouet-Boigny turned into a junior partner of the United States. The United States wishes to bring together the Ivory Coast, Nigeria, Chad, and Upper Volta and assemble a new political group. They accounted for a majority at the Nouakchott Conference and represented an orientation. Among those representing another orientation are Mauritania, Congo (Brazzaville), Cameroon, and Senegal (Senegal’s opposition to the Ivory Coast is due to the personal enmity between [Leopold Sedar] Senghor and Houphouet-Boigny.). They are under the influence of France. Unfortunately, Ghana has made mistakes on many issues. Ghana’s proposal at the conference, made via Upper Volta, was openly rejected and condemned, weakening Ghana’s prestige. Ghana thus also violated the joint position of Ghana, Guinea, and Mali at the trilateral conference in Bamako. It is important here to emphasize that Tunisia, Libya, and Morocco have adopted a position different from that of the Arab countries on the issue of West Germany’s arming of Israel. The three countries are greatly influenced by imperialism. The United States has also put pressure on them. Their domestic economic difficulties and the aid that West Germany has provided them have also played a role. From the start, politically they had a fundamental contradiction with us. Their position on the West German issue has exacerbated this contradiction. I am telling you some of the situation for your reference. Next, let me raise an issue concerning the United Nations. Is this organization useful, or not? On this issue, I would like to hear your view, which would be helpful to us. Zhou: Thank you very much for giving us an introduction to many situations. Now I would like first to ask about the situation in Dahomey. It is said that there are two factions in that country. Which side does Algeria endorse? Ben: We do not know enough about the specific situation. In general, Dahomey is relatively closer to Ghana. Dahomey’s president once publicly stated that Dahomey’s position was closer to that of Ghana. Surprisingly, Dahomey’s prime minister in the end participated in the Nouakchott Conference. However, we believe that this country can still be won over and we continue to adopt a positive attitude toward it. Zhou: I have had a diplomatic representative in Dahomey. Originally, talks on how to establish diplomatic relations reflected those between China and the Central African Republic. In the Central African Republic, our diplomatic representative entered and the Chiang Gang’s diplomatic representative was driven out. However, Dahomey is muddying this issue. The attitude of Dahomey’s president is relatively clear. He agreed to establish diplomatic relations with China. However, Dahomey’s prime minister has suggested that the Chiang Gang’s diplomatic representative could stay, creating two Chinas. According to internal information, it is the United States that wants Dahomey to do this. Speaking of the United Nations issue, I said yesterday that it must be divided into aspects: ours and that of the Asian and African countries. We are not recognized by the United States and, because of US obstruction, cannot join the United Nations. Now there are more countries in favor of restoring China’s legal rights in the United Nations. The United States will certainly carry out the “two Chinas” conspiracy. This means that if two thirds of the countries endorse China, the United States can agree to China joining the United Nations but at the same time will want the Chiang Gang to remain as a unit. Would this not account for what has happened in Dahomey? Of course, we believe that in the end there will be a conclusion there. If Chiang Kai-shek’s representatives does not leave the United Nations, I cannot go there. In the world, new regimes are representing their countries all the time. So it is with the revolutions in both Cuba and Egypt. The special approach in regard to China clearly is the work of the United States. We do not readily join the United Nations because we absolutely do not accept the “two Chinas” plot. Outside of the United Nations, we have the right to criticize the United Nations and express our views. Our criticism is focused against the United States, not against other countries. Asian, African and other countries support the restoration of our legitimate seat at the United Nations. We are always grateful for that. This is an entirely different matter from our criticism of the United Nations and opposition to “two Chinas.”On the other hand, we think that at present the Asian, African and socialist countries of the United Nations should adopt a critical attitude toward the United Nations. We endorse the criticism of Asian and African countries against the United Nations, demand the correction of the United Nations’ errors and the breaking of the United States’ monopoly. Algeria’s representative at the United Nations has issued criticism, and we endorse it. Various Asian and African countries have called for an increase in seats and rights for Asian and African countries in various UN organizations. We support them. What we do not endorse is control of the United Nations by the two great powers: the United States and the Soviet Union. The 19th General Assembly of the United Nations, precisely, was controlled by those two countries. We understand Mauritania and Algeria’s having abstained from voting on the adoption of the resolution on Albania. We not only oppose the monopoly of the two great powers but oppose as well France’s proposal for a monopoly of the five great powers. Now I would like to take this opportunity to talk a bit about points of view on the Second Asian-African Conference. Before we convene the conference, we will come again. First, I will talk about some of the major views: 1. The postponement issue. We have complete confidence in Your Excellency the President’s explanation. We earlier told [Amar] Ouzegane our point of view, but we only asked him to seek President Sukarno’s view as it was he who initiated it. Now the problem has become exacerbated. We fully support convening the conference at the end of June. When I go to Jakarta to participate in the First Asian-African Conference’s 10th anniversary celebration activities, I would also like to explain it to the Indonesian side. 2. The Second Asian-African Conference. It must be based on the principles of the first conference, that is: (1) seeking common ground while putting aside differences and (2) consensus. At the time of the First Asian-African Conference, there was much contention among the Asian and African countries. I recently met [Ahmad] Shukeiri in Beijing. He was at that time the deputy leader of the Syrian delegation. He also clearly recalled that at the time there were two views on the Palestinian issue. Burma’s U Nu had established diplomatic relations with Israel. India had established semi-diplomatic relations with Israel. Both countries joined Ceylon and Pakistan (at that time pro-American) in not endorsing support of Palestine. Four of the five countries that sponsored [the First Asian-African Conference] did not endorse it. Shukeiri met the Chinese delegation. Only then did we learn from him about the Palestinian issue. At that time, we not only assumed our obligation in not recognizing Israel, but also in giving support to the Palestinian people. In the final meeting an agreement was reached. On the issue of opposing imperialism and colonialism, we cooperated with [Gamel Abdel] Nasser and arrived at the 10 principles of peaceful coexistence. At the time, after many twists and turns and by seeking common ground while putting aside differences, consensus obtained good results. We feel that, this time as well, we should abide by this principle to exclude a great deal of trouble. Bilateral or multilateral disputes can be discussed outside the conference. Do not put them on the agenda of the Asian-African Conference. Asian and African countries have many points in common and can reach agreement. As I mentioned last time, the purpose of the conference is to oppose imperialism, oppose colonialism, and safeguard world peace. In addition, there is also much to do to make concrete the Ten Principles of Bandung. The Second Asian-African Conference can do more in respect to developing economic cooperation among Asian and African counties on the basis of equality and cooperation for mutual benefit. If China has any proposal on the issue of economic cooperation, we will certainly first consult in advance with Algeria’s leaders. Prior to the Asian-African summit, there will also be the foreign ministers’ meeting. This is the first issue that I would like to discuss. The second issue, the agreement foreign ministers’ meeting in Jakarta, is the basis for work during the preparatory period. If countries have new proposals, they can only propose them at the foreign ministers’ meeting. At present I have not thought of any issues to raise. At the summit, if we have any issues to raise, we will discuss them in advance with our Algerian brothers. The third issue is that of Soviet participation in the Asian-African Conference. This issue was originally settled at the Jakarta foreign ministerial-level preparatory meeting. At that time the meeting did not reach an agreement, which is to say that the proposal for Soviet participation was not passed. This is to be resolved based on the convention of the First Asian-African Conference. India early proposed that the Soviet Union is not an Asian country and that the part of the Soviet Union in Asia is only one part of its entirety. Nor has the Soviet Union joined the Afro-Asian Bloc in the United Nations. Therefore, the countries that sponsored the First Asian-African Conference did not agree to invite the Soviet Union to participate. At the time, Nehru announced it to the entire world that. You can look it up in the press. At that time, the Soviet Union raised no objection. Nor did the Soviet Union’s ambassador in Beijing inform me that they wanted to go. Some countries have been against the Soviet Union, but we have spoken in defense of the Soviet Union. In the end the meeting did not reach an agreement, so the Soviet Union will not participate. President Nasser, Premier Ali Sabry and Shukeiri all can testify to it. Based on the convention of the first conference, it is quite natural not to have the Soviet Union participate in the second conference. There will also be benefits to the Soviet Union’s not participating this time. This is because this way the socialist country disputes, particularly those between the Chinese and Soviet parties and the two countries, will not be brought to the conference. When I visited African countries at the end of last year and at the beginning of this year, whether public speeches or communiques, none mentioned the issue of Sino-Soviet differences. This time, due to the Vietnam issue, for the first time in bilateral talks we bring the relevant situation to the conference table. If the objective of the Soviet Union’s participation in the conference is to support the countries of Asia and Africa in opposing imperialism, this can be undertaken without Soviet participation in the conference. Conversely, if it were to bring controversy to the meeting, that would only weaken the meeting, which would be detrimental to the Asian-African Conference. We do not fear controversy with the Soviet Union but do not wish to bring that controversy into the meeting. The Soviet Union last year finally informed us for the first time that the Soviet Union’s government was not prepared to request participation in the Asian-African Conference. Since the Soviet Union stated this, we have not raised this issue for quite a long time. Now Algeria is the official host, so we would like to be very frank in telling Your Excellency the President that this is our present attitude. We would like to hear Your Excellency the President’s comment. Ben: Our comment is very simple. Your Excellency the Premier’s talk is very much to our benefit. As the Asian-African Conference’s official host, we must serve the conference and abide by its principles. We hope that the Asian-African Conference reaches consensus. We are striving for this. Of course, not all issues can be resolved, nor consensus be reached in every respect. We also agree that the conference should center on opposing imperialism, opposing colonialism, and safeguarding world peace. We hope that the Second Asian-African Conference assumes more responsibilities and obligations than the Second Conference of Non-Aligned Countries on the issues of opposing imperialism, opposing colonialism, and further supporting national liberation movements. We also approve the principle of the Jakarta foreign ministerial-level preparatory meeting’s agreement. Regarding the issue of the Soviet Union’s participation in the conference, Algeria’s position is clear. We take note that the Soviet Union previously gave us a diplomatic note stating that, if the Soviet Union’s presence would be detrimental to the conference, it would be better that the Soviet Union not participate in it. We are not prepared to take the initiative in opposing the Soviet Union’s participation. Nor will we take the initiative to propose that the Soviet Union participate in the conference. We hope that the Soviet Union will not participate. Zhou:  We clearly understand your attitude. Zhou: I hope that Your Excellency the President will give me an hour alone with you to talk a bit about it. Ben: Very good. I will completely listen to your view. (The two sides settled on 6:00 p.m. for one-on-one talks.)\n",

      "MAO ZEDONG AND LE DUAN[1]  Beijing, the Great Hall of the People, 6:45-8:15 p.m., 11 May 1970 Mao Zedong: When did I meet you the last time?Le Duan: In 1964. We see that Chairman Mao is in good health, and we all feel excited. This time Chairman Mao finds the time to meet us, we are very happy. At present, the situation in Vietnam and in Indo-China is complicated, and there exist some difficulties.Mao Zedong: Every country is facing some difficulty. The Soviet Union has its [difficulty], and the United States has its [difficulty].Le Duan: We are very much in need of getting Chairman Mao’s instructions. If our Central Committee and Politburo learn that Chairman Mao has given instructions about how we should do our job, they will certainly be very happy.Mao Zedong: You have done a very good job, and you are doing better and better.Le Duan: We have tried our best to do our job. We have been able to do a good job because we have followed the three instructions Chairman Mao gave us in the past: first, no fear, we should not fear the enemy; second, we should break up the enemy one piece after another; third, we should fight a prolonged war.Mao Zedong: Yes, a prolonged war. You should prepare to fight a prolonged war, but isn’t it better if the war is shortened?Who fears whom? Is it you, the Vietnamese, Cambodians, and the people in Southeast Asia, who fear the U.S. imperialists? Or is it the U.S. imperialists who fear you? This is a question which deserves consideration and study. It is a great power which fears a small country—when the grass bends as the wind blows, the great power will be in panic. It is true that during the Gulf of Tonkin Incident in 1964 you hit the U.S. imperialists, but it was not your intention to fight a war with the U.S. Navy. In actuality, you did not really hit it [the U.S. naval ship], but they themselves became nervous, saying that Vietnam’s torpedo boats were coming and began opening fire. At the end, even the Americans themselves did not know if there had been a genuine [Vietnamese torpedo attack] or not. The journalists in various places of the United States believed that there had never been [such an attack], and that it was a false alarm. Since the war had already begun, there was no other choice but to fight it. The munition makers and dealers are benefiting from it.American presidents have had much less sleep every night [since then]. Nixon says that he uses his main energy in dealing with Vietnam.Now there is another person, Prince Sihanouk. He is not an easy person to deal with either. When you offend him, he will come out to scold you.[2]Some of our embassies, in my opinion, need to be rectified. Great-power chauvinism exists in some of the Chinese embassies. They only see the shortcomings of the others, paying no attention to the interests of the whole. Who was the last [Chinese] ambassador to Vietnam?Zhou Enlai: Zhu Qiwen.[3]Mao Zedong: Zhu Qiwen had very bad relations with you. As a matter of fact, Zhu Qiwen was a member of the Guomindang, and he planned to escape abroad. We did not know that he was a Guomindang member. Since you were coping with the Guomindang, how could he fail to make trouble for you? We did not know at that time, but we were not happy when we saw those telegrams [he sent back]. Le Duan: We Vietnamese people keep Chairman Mao’s great goodness always in our mind. During the nine years of the war of resistance against the French, if there had not been the support from the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, it would have been impossible for us to win the victory. Why are we in a position to persist in fighting a prolonged war, especially in fighting a prolonged war in the South? Why dare we fight a prolonged war? This is mainly because we have been dependent upon Chairman Mao’s works.Mao Zedong: This is not necessarily true.Le Duan: Of course this is true. We also need to apply [Chairman Mao’s teachings] to Vietnam’s practical situation.Mao Zedong: You have had your own creations. How can one say that you do not have your own creation and experience? Ngo Dinh Diem murdered 160,000 [of your people]. This was reported to me, and I did not know if it was accurate, but I know that over 100,000 people had been killed.Le Duan: Yes, 160,000 had been killed, and many others had been put into prison.Mao Zedong: I think this is good. You can kill our people, why can’t we kill your people?Le Duan: Exactly. In 1969 alone we have killed and wounded 610,000 enemies, among whom 230,000 were Americans.Mao Zedong: The Americans do not have enough manpower to distribute in the world, since already they have been overextended. Therefore, when their people were killed their hearts were broken. The death of several dozens of thousand is a huge matter for them. You Vietnamese, both in the North and the South, in my opinion, it is inevitable for some of you also to be killed.Le Duan: Our current ways of fighting cause low casualties. Otherwise, it is impossible for us to persist for a long time.Mao Zedong: That is true. Maybe the situation in Laos is more difficult. Are there any people of Lao nationality living in China?Zhou Enlai: There are some. Mao Zedong: Where are they? Zhou Enlai: In Yunnan province, the areas bordering Laos. Mao Zedong: Is that Xishuangbanna? Huang Yongsheng: There are some living in Xishuangbanna. Zhou Enlai: Our Zhuang people are very similar to them.Mao Zedong: When the fighting has entered a decisive stage in Laos in the future, we may recruit some Zhuang people in Guangxi and some Dai people in Yunnan. The Zhuang people have a great fighting capacity. In the past the warlords Bai Chongxi and Li Zongren were dependent upon the Zhuang people. How many are the Zhuang people now? Eight million?Zhou Enlai: There are more now, over ten million.Mao Zedong: This is the ethnic group of Wei Guoqing’s, which he did not acknowledge. I once asked him, to which nationality he belonged and if he belonged to one of the minority nationalities. He said that he was a Han. Only later did he acknowledge that he was a Zhuang.Zhou Enlai: The soldiers of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom were capable of fighting. Some of them were Zhuang people.Mao Zedong: Some of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom’s troops were from Guangxi.Le Duan: The Nung nationality in Vietnam are also capable of fighting. They and the Zhuang people in Guangxi belong to the same nationality.Mao Zedong: Southeast Asia is a hornets’ nest. The people in Southeast Asia are awakening day by day. Some pacifists think that cocks like fighting. How can there be so many cocks? Now even hens like fighting.Le Duan: There is no way out if one does not fight.Mao Zedong: Yes, there is no way out if one does not fight. You [Mao speaks rhetorically to the Americans] compel the others [to fight] and leave them no other way to go. You are bullying them.Le Duan: The people in Cambodia and Laos are believers of Buddhism who do not like fighting. Now they have also become fond of fighting.Mao Zedong: This is true. You cannot say that they are not fond of fighting because they believe in Buddhism. The Chinese are also believers in Buddhism, but the 1911 Revolution was followed by seventeen years of fighting. Later it became the fighting between two factions [among the revolutionaries], and thus the people had been educated. Then the Northern Expedition War began, and then the Red Army emerged. Then the Japanese invaded China. After the surrender of the Japanese, Jiang Jieshi fought a war against us. The war lasted for less than four years, he could not continue and fled to Taiwan. He now claims at the United Nations that he represents the whole China. He had very close relations with several of us. I met with Jiang Jieshi quite a few times. When the Guomindang held its Central Committee plenum in Guangzhou I met him. I was a member of the Guomindang. I was a person who shared the membership of two parties. I was a Central Committee member of the Communist party and I was an alternate member of the Central Committee of the Guomindang. During that period several of us joined [the Guomindang]. Our premier [Zhou Enlai] was director of the Political Affairs Department of Jiang Jieshi’s Huangpu Military Academy and deputy party representative of Jiang Jieshi’s First Army. I do not need to mention Comrade Lin Biao. He was Jiang Jieshi’s student. He studied at Huangpu for nine months. In China, there are very few among the people of the old generation who had not dealt with him [Jiang Jieshi].Lin Biao: I was also a member of both parties.Mao Zedong: Even the party branches of the Guomindang were all organized with our help. Without the help from the Communist Party, it would have been impossible for the Guomindang to conduct the North Expedition. At that time, the Guomindang had no party organization, no party branch, in areas along the Yellow River in the North. It depended upon the Communist Party to help it.In addition, we also conducted workers’ movements and farmers’ movements. The Guomindang made use of this thing; it was beneficial to [the Guomindang].  For the first year of the Northern Expedition it made use of [our organizing], and the second year it massacred us.  1926 was the Northern Expedition, and in 1927 [they] massacred us.  Now this Cambodian prince remains on our side; this, too, is very rare.  It’s been sixteen years, and to look at him it seems he is still not afraid of the Communist Party. Zhou Enlai:  On the contrary, Prince Sihanouk now often makes mention of the country’s jungle fighters, and does not emphasize Communists like Xiu Mu.[4] Mao Zedong: Aren’t you going to see him?  Zhou Enlai: Comrade Le Duan is going to see him.  Le Duan: In 1956, when I was working in the south, I heard of Sihanouk’s visit to China, and I was very happy.  I immediately left the south and went to Phnom Penh; we also convened the Cochinchina [Southern Administrative Division] Party Committee there.  (Note: When France ruled Vietnam, it divided the latter into three “administrative divisions”[qi]: South, North and Central; the “Southern Administrative Division Party Committee” refers to the Party Committee meeting in Vietnam’s southern area.)  At the time I asked Sihanouk whether he would allow some of our resistance fighters[5] to go to Phnom Penh.  He sympathized with us at the time.Mao Zedong: Now there is no way he can leave you [plural]. If he left you and the Khmer Rouge, what could he do?  Le Duan:  In my observation, ever since the victory of China’s revolution he has been mulling over [the idea that] that Southeast Asia will surely all be the Communist Party’s one day.Mao Zedong: Right.Zhou Enlai:  He also said when talking to reporters, It might be better if I could become pink[6] right now!  Kang Sheng:  He said that Chairman Mao told him to read books on Marxism.  Mao Zedong:  Many years ago I said to him,  “Why do you have to be the king?  I told him to read two books on Marxism: one was the Communist Manifesto, the other was Socialism from [Utopian] Fantasy to Scientific Development.[7]  He said, I can’t, I’m old; this is my son’s affair.The world is a very strange place.  190 years ago, when the Americans were opposing the British, America’s population was only three million, while the British popular was perhaps 20 million or more; there were British colonies all over the world.  In fact, the main body of Americans, the main portion [of America] was British people.  [As] British people, they wanted to oppose the British people, wouldn’t you say that’s strange?Le Duan: Recently Nixon claimed that the United States had never been defeated in the past 190 years. He meant that this time it would not be willing to be defeated by Vietnam.Mao Zedong: Never defeated?Le Duan: In actuality it has been defeated several times. In China, in Korea, and during the anti-French war in Indo-China. The Americans covered 80 percent of France’s military expenditures. Still it was defeated.Mao Zedong: That is true. You mentioned a moment ago that first of all one should not fear the imperialists. After all, who really fears whom? Small countries. There exists such a problem on the part of small nations. It will gradually try. After trying for a few years, it will understand.During China’s Tang Dynasty there was an author, Liu Zongyuan, who wrote a fable called “The Guizhou Donkey Has Exhausted His Tricks.”[8] [We] can translate it and read it to you.  It’s always the big who fear the small,[9] then the small gradually test [the situation] and [realize] the big ones aren’t scary at all.  In the beginning, this Party of ours had only 70 people, everyone looked down on us; it was only after many setbacks that [we] started to gradually learn a thing or two.  You are all probably more or less clear on this. As for the Cultural Revolution going on now, there are many people who do not understand it.  It is not only foreign comrades or friends who do not understand; there are many among us who do not understand, either.I’ll give an example: near Beijing is the February 7th Locomotive Factory.  This factory had over 8,000 people; 40,000 people including the families.  But it had never been [politically] cleaned up.  Now the moment [we] started to clear it [we found] there were three branches of the Guomindang; they are called district branches.  Besides that, there were three branches of the Guomindang’s Three Principles of the People Youth League.  That is what is being cleared out this time.  Beijing has a big printing factory with several thousand workers called Xinhua Printing Factory: it prints paper money, books and leaflets.  In the Beiyang warlord era it served Yuan Shikai, and after the Northern Expedition it served the Guomindang; when the Japanese invaded, it served the Japanese; after the Japanese surrendered, it served the Guomindang again, and after we defeated the Guomindang it served us.  You see, those who served all those different masters[10] hadn’t been cleared out, and there was a whole mess of characters in there.  All the country’s factories are like that, more or less. Most of the country’s villages have their people[11] too: landlord elements, rich peasant elements, Guomindang elements.  More or less all university professors, middle school instructors and elementary school instructors were absorbed from the Guomindang side, and have never been campaigned against.  Tell me, how could [we] not do [these cleaning-up campaigns]?  We have a bunch of people who criticized the Communist Party in Guomindang newspapers; they wrote articles in newspapers turning themselves in,[12] and followed Jiang Jieshi. They are people like Liu Shaoqi, Peng Zhen and Lu Dingyi.  Peng Zhen is in charge of the city of Beijing, as well as part of the [Party] Central Secretariat.  Lu Dingyi is also Guomindang.  Has he admitted it himself? Zhou Enlai:  Yes, he wrote [the confession] himself.  Besides that, there is also circumstantial evidence.  Mao Zedong:  He is in charge of the Propaganda Department.  The head of the Organization Department, An Ziwen, is also Guomindang.  As for Deng Xiaoping, he’s a bit different from them; he has not been found to have these problems.So, I say that we only have half of Beijing, at most.Our former Chief of the General Staff Luo Ruiqing was a Communist Party member who had never entered the Communist Party.  Lin Biao: A fake Party member.Mao Zedong: He had never entered the Party; he was a phoney.  China has many people, and there are many things going on; it’s extremely complicated, we [as a] minority are at a loss.  Whether it’s veiled struggle or open strife, we cannot defeat them; [but if we] mobilize the masses, there’s nothing they can do.  Foreign friends don’t understand this part; they say, What are you up to?  Today it’s down with Zhou Enlai, tomorrow it’s down with Ye Jianying, the day after tomorrow it’s down with Li Xiannian.  Now [they] understand, there was this clique, a secret clique, called the May 16th Regiment, which took this as an opportunity to try and seize power.  So, we didn’t understand some of it ourselves: why was it that today it was down with Zhou Enlai, tomorrow down with Li Xiannian, the day after tomorrow Ye Jianying, Chen Yi, Nie Rongzhen, Zhu De, Chen Yun – [why] it was down with all these old comrades.  [We] only knew later that it was all mainly their doing.  We couldn’t even understand it, how could you?  Le Duan:  Speaking honestly, we did not understand.  None of our Politburo comrades understood very well; even Chairman Ho [Chi Minh] said he didn’t understand.  Mao Zedong: Now [they] can slowly begin to understand.  Le Duan:  Right.Mao Zedong:  A Red Guard pamphlet was also published that criticized Comrade Kim Il-sung.  I haven’t seen that pamphlet, have you?  Zhou Enlai: I have seen it.Mao Zedong:  It got so that [even] the Korean comrades started getting nervous, too.  Some people want to run over to where you all are and join the army.  In every province, in every county, [people] are divided into two factions, conducting armed struggle [against each other].  We explained that it should be a verbal struggle, not armed struggle, but they’ve just got to do armed struggle.  Let it be armed struggle then if you must.  Only now do [we] know that there were bad people behind it, pulling the strings.  At the time, we said, It’s all-out civil war.  It’s just that it wasn’t in the newspapers, that’s all.  The all-out civil war is fundamentally a struggle between the Nationalist [Guomindang] and Communists; a continuation of the struggle between the two parties.  It has also hurt some good people, but the issue has been mostly cleared up.  Schools didn’t hold classes for four years; I said, The earth is still revolving, isn’t it. Zhou: The satellite was still launched.[13]Mao Zedong:  The old professors have to be protected, though, even if they are Guomindang; it is fine as long as the issue is cleared up.  [They’re] still to collect a salary, and allowed to teach and to write articles; that’s called First Criticize and Second Put To Work.[14] If we don’t use you, we haven’t got anybody.  The issue is cleared up and [the criticized professor] is willing to change, too!  For the elderly -- 70 years old and older -- and the ill, it’s First Criticize and Second Provide For.  If you don’t take care of him, he’s got no way out.  During the French Revolution, Napoleon also did some good things, but later on [he] was no good; later, he became a representative of the big bourgeoisie.  Washington played a role in history, too, so the Americans brag and say that America was a frontrunner in [making] revolution, France came after, Russia came third, and we in the East are even further behind.  According to the order they come in history, that is how it is.  One can’t dismiss the contribution that Washington and others made.  Napoleon made an impact, too, turning some European states into big nation-states: Germany and Italy used to be split into lots of little countries.  Zhou:  Big principalities and little principalities.[15]Mao Zedong: [They’ve] done just about enough bragging now. Le Duan: When I returned from North Korea, Chairman Mao told me that the three countries of Southeast Asia and Indochina would definitely triumph first.[16] After I returned to my country, I reported to Uncle Ho and [my] comrades at the Politburo.  Now the truth is becoming more and more obvious: America arrested Souphanouvong in Laos, and the Laotian people rose up [in opposition]; they killed our people in South Vietnam, and the people rose up; now they have driven Sihanouk out of Cambodia, and the people there have risen up, too. Mao Zedong: That is certainly the case. At that time, I also told you that if the Americans did not come to China’s borders, and if you did not invite us, we would not dispatch our troops [to enter the war].Le Duan: This was also what we thought. When we are still able to continue the fighting, we hope to make our “great rear” more stable. When we Vietnamese are fighting the Americans, China is our “great rear.” Therefore, we once issued such instructions that even though our planes had been attacked they should not land at the airports in China.Mao Zedong: You can [land at our airports]. We do not fear. If the American air force come to attack the “shelters” of Vietnamese air force, let them come.Le Duan: Although we issued such instructions, still we needed to rely on your support. At that time, you dispatched several divisions to Vietnam, also engaged in fighting American planes.Mao Zedong: That is true. The Americans are afraid of being beaten, and they have no guts. You may negotiate [with the Americans]. I am not saying that you cannot negotiate, but your main energy should be put on fighting. Who sabotaged the two Geneva conferences? Both you and us truthfully abided by [the resolutions of the conferences]. But they did not. It is better that they did not.Therefore, even Premier Kosygin of the Soviet Union, when making a public speech, had to say that as long as convening an international conference was concerned, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia must be consulted. Many of their current leaders I am not familiar with, I do not know them. I know Kosygin and have talked with him. The newspapers in the West frequently make rumors about them, saying how divided is their leadership. I am not clear about this either. It is said that the common people are more interested in Kosygin as a leader.Le Duan: We have also heard it.Mao Zedong: You have also heard it? In my opinion, Stalin is alive again. The main tendency in the world today is revolution, including the whole world. There exists the possibility that the big powers may start a world war. But, because of a few atomic bombs, no one dares to start the war. This mainly concerns the two superpowers. At present many say that there are three big powers. China should not be included. China’s study of making nuclear weapons is a recent experience.[17] We are at the stage of research. Why should someone fear us? China is populous and therefore they fear China. But we also have our own fear, we need to feed and to provide clothing for such a large population. Therefore we have now begun the study of birth control so that the large population will be reduced a little bit.  Let us stop talking for now.  You aren’t going to invite him to eat?  Zhou Enlai:  I have already invited him.  Le Duan: Now the spirit of anti-imperialism is very strong across the whole world, and among these anti-imperialist forces, the most powerful is still that of China.  So all the world’s people hope for Chairman Mao to be healthy.  Today we see that Chairman Mao is very healthy; we are very happy.  All the oppressed people of the world are very happy.Mao Zedong:  Thank you.  I’m no good now,[18] I’ll be seeing God soon; the world is theirs, it belongs to you.[19] I am following in Chairman Ho’s footsteps.  Lin Biao:  Chairman Mao is still very healthy.  Zhou Enlai:  Even Sihanouk said, Chairman Mao’s health is the happiness of all the people of the world, including the people of Cambodia.  That feeling is, in fact, genuine.  Lin Biao: It is possible for the Chairman to live into his eighties or nineties. Le Duan: We, too, are expressing our genuine feelings.  We have been able to continue our fighting, this is because the Chairman has said that the 700,000,000 Chinese people are firmly backing the Vietnamese people. The United States is scared. This is very important.[20]Mao Zedong: Why should it be scared? You invade another country, why is it wrong for us to back that country? You dispatch hundreds of thousands of naval, air and land forces to bully the Vietnamese people, who forbids China to become the rear [of the Vietnamese people]? Which law has set up this?Le Duan: The Americans say that they can mobilize 12 million troops, but they can only dispatch half a million troops to Vietnam. They are scared if they cross this limit.Zhou Enlai: China has a large population, which makes them fear.Mao Zedong: Because we have a large population sometimes we do not need to fear. In the final analysis, we do not have relations with you. You have occupied our Taiwan Island, but I have never occupied your Long Island. There [you] go bragging again.Le Duan: Once again, we sincerely thank Chairman Mao.

      "According to the reply of the leading MID [Soviet Foreign Ministry] official competent [to deal with such affairs], one can perceive a slow progress in Soviet-North Korean relations since the visit of Pak Seong-cheol [Pak Song Chol] in Moscow. The economic agreements are being put into effect. The Koreans have not yet given up their request for the construction of a nuclear power plant, which the Soviet side cannot fulfill. They demand the supply of an extremely great volume of arms, and the Soviet Union will partly fulfill [this demand]. During the exchange of goods this year, the Korean side has once again resorted to its usual methods; their export arrears for the first quarter of the year are substantial.The Korean side urges the visit of a Soviet delegation led by [Politburo member Kiril] Mazurov to Korea, which would then be followed by an official visit by Kim Il Sung to the Soviet Union. The Soviet side will fulfill this request, but in all likelihood the delegation will be led by another PB [Politburo] member, rather than the ailing Mazurov.The evaluation of the Soviet side is that Sino-Korean relations have become cooler in the period of the new Chinese leadership.-Marjai-179-\n",

      "In January, a South Korean delegation spent substantial time in Conakry. The delegation was given accommodation in the rest houses reserved for the guests of the government. No Guinean communiqué of any kind has been published about the visit and on its objective and result.The DPRK ambassador was unwilling to speak, or provide information, about this issue to anyone, fraternal [diplomats] included. The Guineans also refrained from [discussing] the subject. In contrast with those news which suggest that the establishment of contacts was confined to the economic and consular spheres, the Western diplomats firmly stated, and still state, that an agreement was reached on the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries, and South Korea will dispatch an ambassador to Conakry within a few months. Certain capitalist diplomatic representations made considerable efforts to prepare the ground for the South Koreans among the Guineans and the DC [Diplomatic Corps]. During casual conversations, the Japanese chargé d’affaires laid particular emphasis on this subject, assuring [the other diplomats] that it would be definitely advantageous to Guinea to establish economic relations with South Korea. He also stressed that this would not be an extraordinary case, since the two Koreas maintained simultaneous diplomatic relations with as many as 21 African countries. To back up this claim, at diplomatic receptions the chargé d’affaires distributed a list that he had prepared, in which he enumerated the aforesaid 21 countries, including Guinea.The fraternal [diplomats] are also of the opinion that apart from the very advantageous opportunities for economic cooperation that [South Korea] had offered, the Guinean decision may have also been influenced by the fact that the assistance which the DPRK provided to the development of industry has ended in fiasco. Shortly after its inauguration, the factory that the DPRK had built in the vicinity of Conakry for the production of porcelain household and sanitary wares ceased to operate due to technological problems and the deficiencies of the mechanical equipment. (Guinea asked Czechoslovakia to carry out the reconstruction. [The Czechoslovak government] did undertake to accomplish that, and its technical experts have already started working.] The cooling of relations is also indicated by the fact that during the last one year, the Korean film shows—which used to be held on every possible anniversary, and at which the Guineans always attended at a high level and made extremely positive speeches that unequivocally supported the DPRK—have discontinued.The establishment of relations with South Korea fits into the leading capitalist countries’ efforts to provide additional support to their economic penetration through their smaller allies, by indirect means. In the political field, they have obtained Guinea’s support to the “two Koreas” principle.József Kertész   Ambassador\n",

      "TELEGRAMSender: PyongyangCLASSIFICATION: SECRETUrgent Date: 03.11.1973/18:00No.: 061.497To: Comrade Director Ion CiubotaruFollowing the latest international events and the [evolution of the] situation in South Korea, we noticed that there were new noteworthy elements in the attitude of the DPRK concerning the unification of the country, such as:Thus we noticed that the frequent references to the “peaceful and independent unification” started to be replaced, depending on the circumstances, with expressions like “the independent unification of the country” or purely with “the unification of the country,” which in the current circumstances, seem to have a totally different connotation.Also, we noticed that internally, in closed-doors meetings, in political education [classes], etc. ideas used in previous years spring up, such as “driving the Americans out of the South of the country and achieving the unification [of the homeland],” “let us achieve the unification during the lifetime of the current generation,” “[let us consolidate the defenses of the country at the same pace with the development of the national economy,” etc. These ideas are increasingly used, especially after the recent meeting of the superior party leadership with the military cadres and the political commanders (20,000 people) in the armed forces. Generally, there is a noticeable state of tension and antagonism. After interrupting the dialogue with the South, both parties, but especially the North, vehemently attacks South Korea, which basically leads to the state of tension preceding the signing of the Joint Communiqué from 4 July 1972.According to press reports and radio broadcasts, party and community organizations, all the cadres in all the units discuss the speech of Comrade Kim Il Sung at the rally in Pyongyang organized on the occasion of Todor Zhivkov’s visit to the DPRK. These press reports and broadcasts contain strong ideas that peace in the Korean peninsula is endangered, that the peace announced by the American imperialists and the South Korean puppets is nothing else but a façade behind which the enemies of the Korean people are preparing a new war against the North, that peace must be conquered and defended with weapons, etc.In a recent discussion between the Romanian Ambassador and the Vice-Premier of the Administrative Council, Heo Dam [Ho Tam], the latter expressed his skepticism regarding the capability of the United Nations Organization to bring something new [to the table] to solve the Korean problem, showing that history demonstrated that plenty of the resolutions and decisions of this organization were ignored. Regarding the situation described above, at their turn, the South Korean authorities are manifesting a lot of concern regarding the “warmongering agitation and the provocations of the North,” regarding the frequent infiltrations in the South of some elements that prepared and supported the recent student movements in Seoul.\n",

      "[...]Memorandum of the First Conversation between Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Ri Ju-yeon(Has not received the Prime Minister's approval)Time: 10 November 1965, 4:00pm – 7:35pmLocation: The Reception Room on the 4th Floor of the Diaoyutai HotelParticipants: Chinese [Communist] Party: Chen Yi, Zhang Hanfu, Qiao Guanhua, Hao Deqing, Jiao Ruoyu, Liu XianglunNorth Korean [Workers’] Party: Pak Seong-cheolTranslators: Chinese: Jiang ChunyiNorth Korean: Kim Sun-hoRecorders: Chinese: Tao Bingwei, He ZhangmingNorth Korean: Paek Hyeong-pokVice Premier Ri Ju-yeon: Since we are the ones who have come to speak with you, I will begin the conversation.  First of all, thank you very much for you warm welcome and accommodation.Premier Zhou: We're all old friends, besides this is a special situation.Ri: We would like to pass on the greetings of Comrade Premier Kim Il Sung to Comrade Premier Zhou and Comrade Vice Premier Chen Yi, and ask that you pass on these greetings to Chairman Mao, Chairman Liu, Standing Committeeman Zhu, and to our other comrades in the country's leadership.Zhou: Thank you, we will pass on your greetings.Ri: As I said when we were in the car, the reason Premier Kim instructed us to come here is so that we can hear Premier Zhou's opinions on the problems currently concerning us.  Originally, a vice member of the central authority was going to be sent, but because the central authority is preparing for a meeting, myself and Ambassador Pak were sent.Zhou: It's the same.Ri: As I said, we have five questions we'd like to hear Premier Zhou's opinions on.First, the Vietnam problem.  The American imperialists are investing a large number of troops in Vietnam.  We have already been tested against the American imperialists, and are still currently at a standoff.  We cannot not be concerned with the situation our Vietnamese brothers are facing.  We would very much like to hear what the Chinese government thinks of the Vietnamese situation.Second, the situation in Indonesia.  Indonesia has had a good relationship with our two countries in the past, but recently they've been unpredictable.  Even though representatives from the embassy have given us some explanations, we feel they are very incomplete.Zhou: Do you have reporters there?Ri: Yes.  But, their understanding of the situation is limited.Zhou: Are your telegrams unblocked?Ri: No.Zhou: We're the same.Ri: What do you think of the situation in Indonesia, Premier Zhou?  We're very concerned with this problem.Third, as for the treaty to be signed between South Korea and Japan, the people of our two countries, South Korea, and Japan are all opposed.  Nevertheless, it seems it will still be passed.  Everyone knows that this is being orchestrated by the American imperialists.  The Japanese Imperialists are preparing to encroach on North Korea and Asia.  In the long term, Japan is our enemy.  We've been tested by America, and it seems we will soon be tested by Japan as well.  That is to say, we will soon be faced with the power of an American-Japanese union.  Under such circumstances, we would like to know what policy China intends to take toward Japan.  What are your thoughts?Fourth, The Second Asia-Africa Conference has been delayed.  What do you think this situation will mean for the cohesion between Asia and Africa?Fifth, we are being faced with unsettling events on all sides.  We fought the American imperialists for three years, leaving our country in ruins.  After the war, we engaged in ten years of reconstruction, returning to a semblance of our prior selves.  Presently, we are preparing to be returned to ruin.  In the face of such a situation, our party has already used the slogan, “A Weapon in One Hand, A Sickle in the Other” to help fortify our nation.  In keeping with this policy, we are currently training and expanding the people's militia.  At the same time, we're digging bunkers all over the country.Zhou: You are very experienced.Vice Premier Chen Yi: Your country's topography is good as well.Ri: We've instructed all of our factory workers to start thinking of things they can do themselves, and in case something happens, they should go into the tunnels.  As we've mentioned before, tunnels are also being dug in Pyongyang.  As everyone knows, North Korea does not have much land and is surrounded on three sides by water.  In case of war,  we do not have any room to maneuver, so we've adopted the strategy of building tunnels.  We're currently implementing a Seven-year Plan, but because of these kinds of problems, I'm afraid we cannot finish on time.  Even so, we are preparing for war.  Because of our experiences in the last war, we are currently stockpiling oil, etc. in preparation.  We would like to know what preparations China is making, and in the case problems arrive, will you be prepared to provide us aid?Zhou:  How much oil do you currently use per year?Ri: Normally, we use 600,000-700,000 tons every year.  Aside from that, there's also the question of grains.  We're doing a bit better than normal, and everyone has enough to eat.  Of course, we still have to import a little, but not very much.  We are working hard to be self-sufficient. Zhou: Do you currently have stockpiles?Ri: No.  The military has some, but very little.  This is exactly what I'd like to talk about, and hear your opinions.Zhou: Thank you for the information, Vice Premier Ri, and we are thankful for Premier Kim's intentions in coming to ask our opinions.  These are all problems that concern both of our countries' obligations in the Eastern hemisphere, so we're both concerned.  We wish to not only express our own opinions, but to hear those of the North Korean party and government.  Of course, our opinions may not currently be complete, but we can talk about them.  I'd like to change the order of the questions Premier Kim has raised a little, and talk about three of those questions this afternoon, two tomorrow morning, and if there are still any questions tomorrow afternoon we can talk about them then.  Today, we can talk about the problems in Vietnam, Indonesia, and that of the Asia-Africa Conference.  Tomorrow morning we can cover the “Korean-Japanese Treaty,” as well as the preparations and strategy China and North Korea can take against the Japanese.  How does that sound?Ri: Good.Zhou: These three questions are all inter-related.  Before we touch on them, I would first like to talk about the changes in the situation of Asia and Africa in the twenty years after the war.  In the first ten years after the war, some countries engaged in reconstruction, while some new independent countries were born, especially some socialist nations.   In the east, the People's Republic of China, People's Democratic Republic of Korea, and People's Republic of Vietnam were created.  Later, North Korea went through a war against American imperialist invasion in which they were victorious and began reconstruction.  Vietnam was involved in the Indochina war against the French, convened the Geneva Convention, coming to an agreement the results of which are that half of Vietnam became Socialist and began reconstruction.  We won't bother to mention the East European socialist nations.Furthermore, the war produced a number of socialist countries in Afro-Asia, significantly impacting international affairs.  For example, after Indonesia became independent, it created a united war front, which has been very useful; India's present work toward the people's liberation movement has been useful.  There's also Burma and Cambodia.  The overturning of the Farouk dynasty in the United Arab Republic encouraged the independence struggle in other countries.  At the time, not only was a new socialist country born, but it was an Afro-Asian country, increasing demand in the region for revolution, liberation, and national independence.  Even though some nations once again became dependent on the Imperialists after gaining independence, they cannot become examples.  They cannot receive too much attention.  For example, the Philippines, Thailand, Turkey, etc.  These countries cannot create progress, only destruction.  This is exactly the situation under which the first Asia-Africa Conference was convened.       At the time, when the first Asia-Africa Conference was held in Bandung, the Imperialist countries did not pay it much attention.  They were under the impression that the meeting, though a gathering of Asian and African countries to exchange ideas, would be thwarted by their puppets from the inside, for example Philippines, Thailand, South Vietnam, Turkey, Lebanon, and the other right leaning countries of the time such as Pakistan, Sri Lanka, etc.  But, in the end the meeting in Bandung was successful, strengthening the desire and determination for independence in Asian and African countries.  Their plot to destroy the meeting was thwarted, which was something they hadn't planned on.  At the same time, there was another event.  At the time, there were two international conferences which resolved some problems.  One was the cease fire negotiations in North Korea.  On one side of the war was North Korea, on the other side was America, but America also represented fifteen vassal states as well as the United Nations.  The other was the Indochina agreement reached at the Geneva Convention in 1954.  The North Korean problem was also discussed at the time, but no agreement was reached.  As a result the Imperialist nations such as England and France got the idea that agreements could be reached through negotiations.  But, in reality, those agreements were reached through war.  This reveals a truth: that the things that cannot be obtained through war, can certainly not be reached through negotiation.  Then, some nations hoped that there would be negotiations between China and America to resolve the problem of Taiwan.  Talks between China and America came about as a result of the Asia-Africa Conference.  We have been negotiating for eleven years beginning in 1954 without any progress, because we still have not waged war over Taiwan.  This proves that negotiation is useless.After the conclusion of the Bandung Conference, several African countries obtained independence one after another.  There were six African representatives at the conference.  Of the six, three were independent countries, namely Egypt, Ethiopia, and Liberia; and 3 were not entirely independent, namely Gold Coast, Sudan, and Libya.  Nations active outside of the meeting include Algeria, Tunisia, Guinea, and Morocco, none of which were independent.  However, in the later ten years after war, the three independent African nations grew to 36.  Of course, their degree of independence varies.  In Asia at the time, because there still had not been a resolution to the problem in North Korea, neither North or South Korea attended, nor did Mongolia.  Malaysia was not invited since they were already independent.  There were 32 attendants from Africa and Asia.There were two modes of development among Afro-Asian countries in the second ten years.  First was to obtain independence through peaceful negotiations, and the other was to do so through armed struggle.  Most countries were liberated through negotiations, so their independence was not complete.  The countries that obtained their independence through war include Algeria.  Congo also obtained a degree of independence, but it was suppressed, reigniting the war.  Sudan has not obtained independence and is always in some kind of struggle whether small or large.And so, in the first ten years, many Asian countries obtained their independence and developed; In the second ten years, there were not many such countries, and the nations that first became independent were divided.  Does this division represent the continuation of the people's revolution or a remnant of imperialism changing them into dependents?  The newly independent regions of Africa also experienced development, increasing the struggle.  After ten years, as the struggle increased, these independent nations became polarized.  Those who desired revolution and continued development on the left, those following imperialism on the right.  Those who were indecisive remained in the middle.  This proves a truth, that nationalists are representatives of the Bourgeoisie.  They have two sides: One is to be active when fighting for independence and afterward, continuing to oppose imperialism and colonialism after obtaining liberation; The other is to remain immobile and conservative.  They do not oppose imperialism, and domestically preserve feudalism, becoming stagnant.  There are few countries in the middle.  The left leaning nationalists want to continue opposition to imperialism and colonialism.  There must be a central leading factor, or they must accept the guidance of a communist party, or cooperate with it to keep the left maturing, and finding the reason behind revolution.  In Asia, these kinds of countries are rather few in number, and in Africa the majority of countries do not have communist parties.  On the topic of communist parties, the last ten years have produced a certain new situation, namely the rise of revisionism.  In 1953, Khrushchev took the stage.  In the first two years, revisionism was still in the process of developing and did not have a large impact on the international scene.  So, the USSR revisionists did not pay much attention to the Bandung Conference,   Nehru did not invite Khrushchev and he didn't say anything about it.  In 1954, prior to the Asia-Africa Conference, we raised five principles to which Khrushchev did not pay attention either.  Afterward, the Bandung Conference was reaffirmed.  In 1954, we pointed out that peace is conditional.  In the 20th Congress of the CPSU, he spoke of peace, and argued with us.  In reality, two are not the same.  The last ten years were not the same.  The revisionists became active and formed a coalition.  They've been particularly active in the past few years.  Under these conditions, the communist party has become divided.  Only true Marxist-Leninists can lead the people's revolution, like the Indonesian Communist Party.  And then there is the nationalist right who chase imperialism and revisionism, becoming revisionists.  India's Dange Group is a classic example.  African and Asian countries have also become divided in foreign policy.  The leftists who truly support people's independence carry on the fight for revolution.  South Africa, Central Africa, Vietnam, and Laos have all begun their revolution.  The nationalist right opposes people's liberation movements, even to the point of following and supporting imperialism, helping to suppress the people's struggle for liberation, like when India supported the United Nations in sending troops to Congo, killing Lumumba, and arresting Gizenga.  The nations in the middle approve one minute and are opposed the next.  Today they are with us, tomorrow they're against us.  They are entirely indecisive. Modern revisionism has shown its colors.  It supports the right, and opposes the people's liberation movement.  It believes that a small spark can turn into a big war, and completely ignores the development that the people's liberation movement has undergone in the past twenty years.  As a result, modern revisionists approve of the United Nations sending troops to Congo, and currently supports the American imperialists holding peace talks in Vietnam.  This time in Indonesia they support the Right of the Indonesian army.  For example, they work with Nasuiton, and may even support the formation of a revisionist party by the Indonesian Right.Similarly, the people's armed revolutionary struggle has also been impacted, it has been divided.  Some take a stance of armed struggle to the end, when they have obtained independence; some support peaceful negotiation, meeting in the middle.  This is most evident in Congo.  The situation is complicated.  Today they tell us they want a war of resistance, tomorrow they want to surrender.  The situations in Central and South Africa are the same.  There's been a theme over the past ten years, countries that have already obtained independence continue to split.  Those that lean toward the left do well, while the citizens of countries on the right are dissatisfied and want to revolt.  This has already happened in some countries.  For example, Zanzibar was like that in 1964.  Congo is another example.  After gaining independence, their leaders became tools of the French Imperialists.  When the Bourgeoisie overthrew them in August of 1963, the revolution was successful.  That is the nature of things. When a government is overthrown, sometimes it gets better and sometimes it gets worse.  There are plenty of examples of this.  Arabia and Africa both have had these kinds of experiences.  The overall trend is that even if a country's first step is to obtain independence, no matter what, once independence is obtained, a nation must depend on its military might.  Those who obtain the right to rule through peaceful negotiation all now understand that they must have military power. Afro-Asian countries that depend on their military to protect their right to rule are increasing in number daily.  There are almost none that do not.  The trend is that the rightists depend on the militaries of the colonialists.  Of course they also have some military of their own to maintain stagnation.  Those in the middle are half self-dependent.  One part of their military belongs to the colonialists, and part is their own. Those on the right protect themselves, and are even more revolutionary.  The military that I'm talking about is of course that of the Bourgeoisie.   So, in the last ten years, the people's independence movements in Africa and Asia have been developing.  After rising up, their top leadership splits into two camps, with very few in the middle.  When re-consolidating their power, they either follow Imperialist nations, becoming a colony, or they revolt, walking the path of independent development.  As a result, there is also a huge division among those in the middle.  Other nations have a big impact on them, Imperialist and revisionist nations have influence, and those Marxist-Leninist nations who maintain revolution to the end also have influence.  And so, this is a time of significant upheaval, division, and reorganization.  It can be said that the situation before the convening of the first Asia-Africa Conference was such that the desire for revolution was strong and mainstream, whereas the non-mainstream was divided and easily broken and so the conference was successful.   In the past ten years, the mainstream supporters of people's independence and revolution are increasing, but will not revolt, and the non-mainstream saboteurs of revolution have also increased in number, and while the mainstream is the root, the non-mainstream also has influence; they can affect every time, region, country, and movement.  For this reason, the first Asia-Africa Conference was easy, but the second one ten years later has been postponed three times, and still has not been convened, so if we hold it in June of this year, there will still be arguments. And so, imperialism is good, and revisionism is also good.  They allowed the Non-Aligned Movement Conference, the African Summit, and the Arabian Summit, but cannot tolerate the Asia-Africa Conference, and it is no simple matter of geography, rather one of the nature of the conference.  The other conferences were tolerated because they were not about the fight against imperialism and colonialism, nor were they promoting armed struggle.  The Asia-Africa Conference on the other hand is one to oppose imperialism and colonialism.  There is struggle here both in support of and counter to revolution.  Let me give an example to explain my point.  The Non-Allied State Conference was held last year in Cairo, the tone of which was very anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist.  However, very quickly there were seventeen non-aligned countries who, in reaction to the American imperialists' peace talks, wanted to spin the Vietnam problem to one of war between Vietnam and the American imperialists, rather than Vietnam resisting the American imperialists' invasion.  This proves that sometimes what they say and what they do are not the same.  One aspect of the African Summit was to support the armed struggles in Central and South Africa, even to the point of organizing a committee in Tanzania.  Another aspect was to organize a mediation committee in Kenya.  This conference has suffered the determination of those opposed to the people's liberation struggle, even refugees of the revolution have been expelled, calling their activities subversive.  This is exactly the problem.  It is reflective of the two sided-ness of the Bourgeoisie's rule.  On the other hand, the Asia-Africa Conference has communist leaders, and participating countries that support Marxism-Leninism like China, North Korea, and Vietnam.  This will impact some certain countries that are influenced by communist parties or have contact with communist parties.  Indonesia, for example.  If we are able to hold a conference like this, we will maintain revolutionary policies, arguing against compromise.  In the end, this problem will be resolved by truth.  Therefore, imperialism is terrified of this conference, they cannot afford not to destroy it.  Revisionism is scared as well, and is willing to fight its way in and do imperialism's work for it.  From last year to this year, we have been facing this problem from beginning to end.  Once the conference is convened, we must argue.  We must confront this struggle.  The problem at the heart of the rest is that of Vietnam.  America has stated publicly that the Asia-Africa Conference will oppose American imperialism, calling for America to withdraw its troops.  Asia has over 60 countries, influencing world opinion, and they are willing to move in support of Vietnam.  Modern revisionism wants to squeeze its way into the Asia-Africa Conference to destroy it and weaken everyone on the Vietnam problem.  They will attempt to be low key, shielding the American imperialists.  The Vietnam situation proves this point.Now, let's talk about the Vietnam problem itself.We've had two opportunities to speak with our comrade the leader of Vietnam recently.  Once was when a delegation from the Vietnamese Party passed through Beijing on the way to the USSR to discuss the matter of aid.  The second was over the past couple of days when we went to Guangzhou to meet with the him.Our opinions on the following matters are rather close.The first problem is that of the conditions of the Vietnam War.  Everyone believes that the war will continue, and that there is currently no possibility for negotiation.  The situation is still not mature.  That is to say, the current so called “peace talks” are a product of the American imperialists' scheming.  America's scheme is to negotiate with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in order to make its invasion legal and make La [sic] unable to move in Vietnam.Recently our comrade from Romania told me that [Dean] Rusk has spoken with the Romanian Foreign Minister in the United Nations.  Several nations are engaging in peace talks.  Nasser and Tito are as well.  Their actions are useless.  They all just want the Nobel Prizes.  Rusk hopes that Romania will approve of their activities, snooping around to see what problems exist between China and Vietnam.  Our Romanian comrade answered saying that a decision has already been reached at the 9th Romanian [Party] Congress.  They support the four policies adopted by the People's Republic of Vietnam: China and Vietnam are united.  They don't care about receiving Nobel Prizes, rejecting their requests.  Our Romanian comrade also asked Rusk what their position is in the peace talks with America.  Rusk responded that the People's Republic of Vietnam is pushing four points, the first of which is that America must withdraw troops from Vietnam.  This is non-negotiable.Ambassador Pak: So the negotiations will be unsuccessful.Zhou: The other three points can be discussed.  It is very clear that America wishes to legalize their invasion of Vietnam.  That is also to say, that the war has still not come to the point where America will admit defeat.Originally America dispatched 135,000 troops, which has already increased to 170,000.  By the end of the year they could reach 200,000.  They've already exceeded the originally stated number.  Because of this, in the invasion of Vietnam, not only do they send puppet soldiers to the front lines, but they also have to send horses.  Sometimes American soldiers even fight alone.Recently the People's Army of South Vietnam reported that they destroyed 130,000 troops in September, over 8,000 of which were American.  The proportion has increased.  But this is only the beginning, so if America is not willing to admit defeat, then they will also be unable to truly negotiate.In the course of the war's development, in the end they will either fight to the last man, disperse, or admit defeat.  If there are none left, then naturally there cannot be negotiations.  If they disperse, then there is still no way to negotiate.  It is only with the admittance of defeat that negotiations can be held.  America was not involved in the Chinese war of liberation, but they orchestrated it from behind the scenes.  When the Jiang [Jieshi] bandits fell, America dispersed without negotiations.  In the Korean War, America was defeated, admitted defeat, and negotiations were held.  In Vietnam, America still has not exhausted its resources, has not dispersed, and will not admit defeat, so they will not be able to negotiate.  The Vietnamese intention is to fight out a result.    It isn't that Vietnam will only fight and is not willing to negotiate.  It's just that the current situation has not matured, and the situation is such that the People's Republic of Vietnam's government’s four conditions and the five conditions set by the South Vietnamese People's Liberation Front absolutely cannot be reduced.The Vietnamese party, government, and people are the leaders in the Vietnamese problem.  All that we can do is support them, we do not have the right to change nor reduce their conditions.However, the USSR has already begun all kinds of negotiations behind closed doors.  America will not be mentioned in the era of Khrushchev, apparently even America's firing its cannons is a result of China's provocation.  As for the new leader of the USSR, Kosygin spoke with us when he passed through Beijing on the way to Hanoi this February.  He said that they only offer support to Vietnam, but cannot act on their own.  He also asked the opinion of the Chinese party.  We answered saying that we would still like to ask the opinion of Vietnam.  However, as soon as Kosygin returned to Moscow, the offensive came.  He immediately began rushing about asking for peace talks.          The Vietnamese government responded saying that they cannot negotiate.  We said that we could not give them an answer until we knew Vietnam's thoughts on the matter.  The USSR government, however, did not pay attention to Vietnam's objections, nor did they wait for our answer.  They went straight to Charles De Gaulle for peace talks.  From that time on, the international community has all been chattering about how the USSR is willing to negotiate with only China opposed.  The USSR has always been wavering on the 4 points raised by Vietnam.  When Nasser visited the USSR in the latter half of this year, the reports issued by the USSR were very low key on the question of Vietnam.  They did not condemn the American invasion, nor did they demand that America withdraw from Vietnam.  Does the USSR have no choice but to stand with Nasser on these issues?  I don't believe so.  Recently, on the 5 November, Nasser issued a public report with Guinea’s Sékou Touré, after which his tone on the Vietnam issue changed.  Previously, Comrade Chen Yi visited Guinea and spoke with Touré concerning Vietnam.  So, it can be seen from Nasser and Touré’s report condemning the American invasion of Vietnam that Nasser is able to accept such a stance.  Why is that he is suddenly unable to accept it when in the USSR?  In reality, it's just that the USSR did not want to bring it up, and changed their position on Vietnam.  Vice Premier Chen Yi said that the USSR has not influenced Nasser, rather it is Guinea that swayed him.  Before and after the 20th of September, I visited Guinea for two days and had a long talk with Touré.  We spoke for ten hours.  He said that he wants to intervene in the Sino-Soviet split.  He said that the Sino-Soviet split is a global problem, which he has the right to speak on.  I said, “Correct, it is a global problem which impacts the destiny of the world.  You do have the right to speak on it.”  I told him repeatedly, “If you mediate in the Sino-Soviet split without taking into account right and wrong, then you will certainly be aiding revisionism.”  He was furious, saying, “You are burning bridges by speaking like this to me; If no matter who helps who it's all helping revisionism, then who will come to mediate again?  From now on I will not try to mediate again!”  I responded saying, “You are welcome to come participate in negotiations, but you must clearly distinguish between right and wrong.  These are significant rights and wrongs.  Not distinguishing between the two will be of no help to you, indeed it will be extremely inconvenient.  For example, when the USSR decided to abandon its relationship with Albania and pull its experts out of China, tearing up our contracts, were we in the wrong?  This is the Soviet Union cooperating with America to conquer the world.  They say that Marxism-Leninism is outdated, and we say that it is still necessary.  We take a position of revolution.”  Touré said that China has many reasons for its split with the USSR, whereas the USSR's reason are few.  Therefore, his trip to the USSR was only a visit in which he told them to be better to China, that its actions are baseless whereas China's actions are sensible.  He also said, “If you don't believe me, you can go look at the records of the meeting in Moscow.”  I told him, “As long as you distinguish between right and wrong, we welcome your opinions on the Sino-Soviet split.  If you cannot distinguish between the two, it will be very troublesome for you, you will be taken advantage of.  He said, “From now on I just won't worry about the Sino-Soviet split.”         He then said, “Marshall [Chen Yi], you say that negotiations and peace talks are helping America.  Your position on this is extremely clear, but I do not agree.”  I responded, “No, that's not what we mean.  In the Vietnam War, you have to distinguish between the invaders and those being invaded, those doing the damage, and those being damaged.  America is harming the people of Vietnam, so the people must resist.  Anyone with a sense of justice must call for America to end their invasion of Vietnam.  Nothing else is acceptable.  Our stance is that engaging in peace talks is the same as helping America, so the Vietnamese people cannot accept it.”  He said, “So I will condemn America at the African Summit”.  I replied, “I thank you, and the people of Vietnam also thank you.  Not long ago, Nasser issued a public report with the USSR speaking of peace talks, not distinguishing between right and wrong.  I hope you will do differently at the African Heads of State Conference, since what he did has no meaning.”Zhou: This is related to the situation in Vietnam.  Currently, the Vietnamese people will keep fighting until America admits defeat.  We agree with them.  Vietnam's government has set their four conditions for negotiation.  They will not be reduced.The second matter is the current condition of the war.Our comrade from Vietnam tells us that their victory in the rainy season exceeded expectations.  America even admitted that they had originally hoped to improve their position, but were unsuccessful.  You've seen recently how big America's losses have been in their two military engagements on land surrounded by water.  America has combined their army, navy, and air force all to attack a beachhead, and lost.  They've used “Blot Tactics” to eliminate a radius of 50 kilometers, but there are guerrilla forces just fifteen kilometers from Saigon.  Skirmishes have also broken out within Saigon.     Supposedly there are 500,000 puppet soldiers (Including regular and local forces), but in reality there are only 60-70 percent of that number, they can't take anyone prisoner.  America has been holding a meeting with the puppet governments for the past few days during which they admitted this point.  There are not enough puppet soldiers, so America has no choice but to take things in their own hands, accepting losses.       Our comrades in Vietnam tell us that once the rainy season has passed, they are preparing to regroup during the dry season.  During next year's rainy season, they plan to achieve victory.  They plan to obtain victory within three years.  Currently they've run into a few problems.  America is using B-52s to carpet bomb them, so they will possibly suffer losses, and infrastructure could be damaged.  However, they are already thinking of ways to avoid this problem: If they know about the bombing beforehand, then they can evacuate or camouflage themselves to avoid losses.America is blowing smoke right now.  If the armed resistance in the South just relaxes a little bit and the North stops sending more troops to the south, then they can stop bombing.  They will try this method.  Some nations in Eastern Europe are also promoting this.  However, the military strength of South Vietnam will only continue to strengthen.  America has also noticed that the North has sent two groups of reinforcements (They've noticed two numerical divisions).  Therefore, America's fantasy has been broken.  In reality, the reinforcements sent by the North do not stop at just two divisions.     Ambassador Pak: The foreign news says that is the 325th Division.Zhou:  Our Vietnamese comrades say that they will continue to send reinforcements.The third matter in question is that of the developmental path the war will take.Our Vietnamese comrades are, subjectively speaking, containing the war in the South.  It is there that they will resolve the problem.  America also is currently only deploying to the south.  They want to limit the conflict to the South and seize it.  This is the desire of both parties.  However, war does not frequently develop according to one's wishes.  They must prepare for the possibility that the war will expand.  America also says that it wishes to “gradually escalate” the war.  America originally said that they will not bomb the 50 kilometer radius around Hanoi, nor will they bomb the coastal defense perimeter because there are Soviet warheads there.  The Soviets have also said that their warheads can protect Hanoi and the coastal defense perimeter.  And so, the reason America does this is because they hope that the Soviets will pressure Vietnam to accept peace talks, but Vietnam will not accept.They've already bombed within 50 kilometers of Hanoi in the past two or three rounds of bombing.  Our Vietnamese comrades told me they are afraid that there may be no geographic limits to the bombing now.  Hanoi is completely evacuated now, even the children, in preparation for the bombing.The planes the US has lost in North Vietnam are already more than 600 in number.  Because they suffered losses in the bombing, they felt the insufficiency of their air force.  There are even some training personnel participating in the war.  Something like this happened just three days ago: a plane was taken down (five people in total), and a helicopter was dispatched to save them, but due to artillery fire was unsuccessful.  Of the five occupants of the plane, two were taken captive, and three hid but were unable to escape and could only wait until night to send up a distress signal.  This proves that the American air force personnel are insufficient, and morale is low.  Ambassador Pak: What proportion of their total air force is participating in the war in South and North Vietnam?Zhou: Check the report tomorrow (Note: Premier Zhou had already given related materials to Vice Premier Ri Ju-yeon on 12 November).  Essentially, there are two divisions, one is on the front lines and the other is a reserve force.  They are divided domestically and all over the world, and cannot be picked out.Our Vietnamese comrades have also prepared for America to spread the war to North Vietnam.  They have recently postponed our plans to provide aid.  They want to engage in smaller, spread-out projects.The American bombs are mostly concentrated on main roads, military bases, armories, and factories.  The Vietnamese comrades have, like those in North Korea before them, learned methods of self-protection. For example, the use of bridges, and dismantling things in the day and storing them at night.If the war spreads to North Vietnam, it is very possible that it will also spread to China.  As America is bombing the two railroads in North Vietnam, sometimes a plane will cross over to our side, at which point we shoot it down.  If the war becomes even larger, the border will become even more fuzzy.  In this case, it will certainly spread to China.  Therefore, we've been preparing.  We'll talk about our war preparations tomorrow.The fourth question is that of China's cooperation with and support of Vietnam.Besides assisting with military resources, we've also sent a division of engineers to Vietnam to repair railroads and highways.  They're restoring the railroads and highways that were bombed in Hanoi (The ones that run to Guangxi and Yunnan).  They are also restoring fortifications on offshore islands.  At the same time, we sent troops to guard the workers as they repair the railroads.  By the beginning of next year we intend to send a total of 230,000 engineers and protection forces.  This is not public information.  On the other hand, Vietnam is using some of our provinces as a place to fall back to.  They send their wounded, and some people for training.  Soldiers and technical personnel all come.  We have four provinces set to maintain contact with Vietnam and act as their rear: Yunnan, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hunan.The fifth matter I will address is that of the argument over the USSR's support of Vietnam and the consequential split.  In retrospect, when the new leader of the USSR took office, approved of and aided Vietnam, his actions were obviously welcome.  We've told Kosygin, “As long as you support the war in Vietnam, the more support you offer, the more useful you are, and the more effective it is, the better.”  From the perspective of aid,  a portion certainly appears to have fought the enemy, so we cannot say that it hasn't been useful.  However, the USSR's motive in helping Vietnam is to control the political situation there, at the same time securing the right to speak with America in negotiations.  It was actually selling out the Vietnamese people.America has said itself, if China supports Vietnam, then they will fight to the end, but if the USSR supports Vietnam, then there is the possibility for negotiation and ending the war early.  (Vice Premier Chen Yi commented, “Even America can see this clearly.”)The new leader of the USSR has indicated that they regret the way they spoke to us.  We responded saying, “Why don't you condemn America?  Why don't you support Vietnam in fighting the war to victory?  Why don't you refute the rumors?”  They remained silent.  The devil is in this detail.We wrote an article concerning the USSR's support of Vietnam and its effectiveness, and it will be distributed tonight at 8:00.  You can read the report tomorrow and consult with us about it. We won't bother talking about it anymore here.  Of course, this is what we think of the mater, but we should also point out that recent events prove that our opinions are not unfounded.  America suggested condition-less negotiation, and said that it would send 1,000,000,000 dollars to aid development in Southeast Asia, and end the Vietnam War.  The Vietnamese government has already voiced their opposition.  Even Prince Sihanouk is openly opposed.  In pursuit of its goals, America even held a Southeast Asia Developmental Banking Meeting in Bangkok.  However, the USSR also attended this meeting and wanted to invest.  Who were they sitting with?  Aside from America, there was also Thailand, the Jiang [Jieshi] bandits, Saigon, South Korea, and Japan.  It's unseemly!  Not only does the USSR want to participate in the Africa-Asia Conference, but they also want to be in the Southeast Asia Group, and Northeast Asia group!  Of course, America welcomes them to participate in the discussion of a Southeast Asian Development Banking constitution.  We simply could not imagine they would sink this low.  To Vice Premier Chen Yi: “Could you imagine this?”  Vice Premier Chen Yi: “I never expected it!”The USSR's goal in aiding Vietnam is to ruin the relationship between China and Vietnam and obtain the right to speak on their behalf.  So, we told our Vietnamese comrades, “You cannot refuse the USSR's aid, but this casts a shadow on Sino-Vietnamese relations”.Originally, Vietnam didn't think that Sino-Vietnamese relations would be impacted by the USSR.  They did not really agree with our way of looking at it.   But recently, the USSR sent us a letter to try to pass on their problems.  I'll give the letter to Comrade Kim Il Sung a little later.  (Ambassador Pak said, “We've already received it.”) After this event, I went to Guangzhou to speak with Vietnam's highest ranking leaders, at which time they also admitted that a shadow has been cast over our relationship.Furthermore, I told our Vietnamese comrades, “The Chinese [Communist] Party is good, and so is the Vietnamese Party.  There will always be those on the left and on the right, both in the cadre and among the people.  Those in the middle are of good intentions but are susceptible to being duped.”  Our Vietnamese comrade agreed, saying, “The central authorities of our two parties will not be affected, we will still fight together against imperialism to the end.”  I responded, “Correct, but we must increase our vigilance and guard against meddling; we also must educate the well intentioned to prevent them from being fooled.”  Our Vietnamese comrade agreed.The heart of the Vietnam matter is how we support the Vietnamese people in their fight to victory.  Everything else must serve this purpose. The final matter is like this.For a year, we have been passing on the Vietnamese people's struggle against America.  People from Asia, Africa, and Latin America all place importance on this struggle, because the Vietnamese problem has become the world's problem.  What do the Imperialist nations think?  What do the people of the world think?  Now, the people of the world who support the Vietnamese people are ever increasing in number.  The American people have even risen up, something that did not happen during either the Korean nor the Chinese wars for people's liberation.  American professors, students, workers, and intellectuals all oppose America's invasion of Vietnam and call for withdrawal of troops, even to the point of self-incineration as a form of protest.  First, an older woman in West Germany incinerated herself, and a student did the same just yesterday.  Even the British Bourgeoisie scholars like Russell support Vietnam and oppose the American invasion.  Our socialist nation and communist party's support of Vietnam is different.  We do not support their four conditions.  Doesn't that show the Imperialists that there is a split between us?The USSR constantly puts its cooperation with America first.  Recently, Polyansky said in a speech for October's Revolution Day, “The problem of Vietnam and that of the multilateral nuclear power situation both hamper Soviet-American cooperation”  We are starkly opposed to this this statement.  Later, when the speech was published, “Soviet-American cooperation” was changed to “the working relationship between America and the USSR”.  (Vice Premier Chen Yi commented, “They work together so well!”)  In this matter, our three nations may see things differently, but that cannot obstruct our support of the people of Vietnam in their struggle to victory over the Americans.How about we end today's discussion here?Ri: Have you gotten tired, Comrade Prime Minister?Zhou:  We still haven't spoken about the conditions of Indonesia and Afro-Asia.  We still have other things to attend to today, so I suggest we reconvene tomorrow at 8:30 in the morning.  First, I'd like to ask Vice Premier Chen Yi to explain the situation concerning our plans to visit Africa and the Asia-Africa Conference.  I will arrive at 9:30 at which point we can talk about the Indonesia matter as well as our policies concerning Japan and war preparations.  We will have to go over time tomorrow.  We won't finish unless we speak three times.Ambassador Pak: Even though your schedule is tight, I'd still like to ask you a few questions.  The situation in Vietnam could take three possible routes.  Which do you think is the most likely?Zhou: Our current analysis shows that they will have to admit defeat.  It would be best if they were destroyed, and better if they were forced to withdraw without fighting.  It would save us a lot of trouble.  However, at the moment our Vietnamese comrades agree with our opinion that America must sign an admittance of defeat.  If the movement around the world is successful, then they might admit defeat and leave right away.Ambassador Pak: One more question, is there the possibility for a battle like the one at Dien Bien Phu?Zhou: Vietnam currently still does not plan to assemble all of its power and fight a war of annihilation.  Right now they are still in the phase of using several small victories to equal a large one.  Of course, we cannot eliminate the two other possibilities.  The first is that the puppet army will be weakened to the point that they can be completely destroyed.  The puppet army has 9 main forces which tend to move as a group.  Currently we could destroy half of one camp.  The next step is to prepare to annihilate the entire group.  If we are successful, we can coax the American army out and destroy it completely.  (Vice Premier Chen Yi said, “This is also “gradual escalation”!)  Right now we could only destroy a part of the chain, we would still have to “gradually escalate” in the future.  So, we still cannot think about whether or not a Dien Bien Phu style battle could come about this year or next year, but we should always fight for such an opportunity.  The future is not one battle like that at Dien Bien Phu, rather several.  The Chinese War of Liberation was first fought on a small scale, then we began destroying the enemy, division by division, to the point where we defeated two division.  In Jinan we defeated 3 divisions, after which came three large battles.  We didn't even expect things to develop that way.  Vietnam's current three year plan is correct.Vice Premier Chen Yi: America currently has three bridgeheads in Vietnam.  Waiting to destroy them will not work.Ambassador Pak: The American and puppet armies are both stationed in five bases in Saigon, Danang, and others along the coast.  If the Vietnamese Liberation Army were to cut off their transportation line, would that pose a shipping problem for the Americans?Zhou: Yes, it would have a huge impact.  So, America has a huge number of freight vehicles and helicopters, more even than actual war machines.  I will bring a map tomorrow and explain to you how to cut the middle out of the whole.  Ambassador Pak: Have their sea routes been cut off at any point?Zhou: The coastal bases have not been cut off, but the non-coastal ones have.Vice Premier Chen Yi: The America army mostly just come out to clean up and augment the puppet army.  This is where they will suffer the most hardship.  The five bases are constantly being surrounded and ambushed, and every time they go out to augment the puppet army they are ambushed, so the American army is at greater risk.  Sometimes, the five bases and others that have American troops stationed there are attacked at the same time.Zhou: The Vietnamese have surpassed us in this aspect.Vice Premier Chen Yi: We didn't have as much ammunition at the time.Zhou:  Actually, that wasn't the problem.  The problem was the development of people's war.  You've already sent people to study that.Ambassador Pak: Geographically and militarily speaking, the American bases are next to the ocean and depend on it.  That is their world.  The Vietnamese People's Liberation Army has their back to the sea.  Isn't that disadvantageous? Zhou: They have aircraft carriers, they stay on the carriers and don't come off which makes them difficult to attack.  However, their five bases are easy to attack.  Once all of the other locations have been lost, the five bridgeheads will be useless, so they will pull out.  Right now, the important thing is that puppet army, but fighting the American army is on the agenda.  When the situation is right, we fight the Americans.It looks like we must hold our meeting over two days.[...]\n",

      "Foreign Ministry Top Secret ArchivesRecord of Second Conversation of Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Chen Yi with Vice Premier Ri Ju-yeon [Ri Ju-yon](Premier, Vice Premier have not yet examined and approved)Time: 8:30 a.m. To 1:30 p.m., 11 November 1965Location: Conference Room, Villa 4, Diaoyutai State Guest HouseParticipants:Chinese side: Li Xiannian, Fang Yi, Zhang Hanfu,  Qiao Guanhua, Li Qiang, Hao Deqing, Jiao Ruoyu, Liu XianglunKorean side: Pak Seong-cheol (Pak Song-chol), Pak Se-changInterpreters:Chinese side: Jiang ChunyiKorean side: Kim Sun-hoRecorders:Chinese side. Tao Bingwei, He ZhangmingKorean side: Go Sang-gyun [Ko Sang-gyun], Baek Hyeong-bu [Paek Hyong-bu]Vice Premier Chen Yi (hereafter, “Chen”): I will first discuss our relations with Asian and African countries and the situation in Asia and Africa.From October last year until the present, for over a year now, we have largely spent our time in work on Asian and African countries. At the present time we have developed the following assessment: The world situation and the situation in Asia and Africa, generally speaking, are now diverging, various forces are restructuring, and the fight is now penetrating deeply. Although there has been a turn to the right, the general trend is one that is beneficial to the various countries and peoples of the world and is not beneficial to imperialism.The imperialist camp is now splitting. Relations between [Charles] de Gaulle and the United States are tense, with his call for a reorganization of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Although Britain is prepared to follow the United States unconditionally, on the whole, they cannot entirely follow the United States. Public opinion in London is now discussing Britain’s three prospects: First, should it become the forty-ninth [sic] state of the United States? Second, should it become a “peaceful and neutral” country like Switzerland? Third, should it enter the European Communities (EC)? First, discussion is taking place via a well-known British magazine. The Times is also discussing this problem. Officials of the British Foreign Ministry and some members of the bourgeois class have also talked about this problem with our charge d’affaires. They said: Britain is a small country, Britain is a sick person. In the past they said that China was the sick man of East Asia. Now they themselves say that this label is in the past. Today Britain relies on foreign imports for 90 percent of its industrial raw materials. It relies on foreign imports for agricultural products as well. The British clearly understand that the continuing development of the Asian, African, and Latin American national liberation movements is not beneficial to them in these two matters. They will be facing the general collapse of their industry and agriculture. What remains is the British metropole, and it only has a little coal and iron. Now the British discuss and know: They cannot become a state of the United States. As for becoming a “peaceful and neutral” country like Switzerland, they also know that it would be very difficult to achieve, because Britain is not in the center of Europe, but in Western Europe. They think that the greatest potential would be to join the EC. Britain’s bourgeois class has an optimistic assessment, which is that Britain, France, and West Germany would establish a united EC that would be able to contend with the United States and the Soviet Union. The forces of such countries as Britain, France, and West Germany, added together, could in industry be nearly equal to that of the United States, although there would still be a little less. In agriculture, they can themselves think of a solution. Therefore, they can contend with the United States and the Soviet Union, confront the national forces of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and become a third force.However, the French and Europeans do not approve of assimilating Britain’s joining the EC. Britain day after day is turning into a satellite state of the United States. The British ruling class, of course, is still struggling. At present the Labor Party government is more subservient than the Conservative Party to the United States. But they are still going to continue struggling. Therefore, relations within imperialism, too, are undergoing reorganization. In their anti-communist and anti-popular aspects, they are in accord. There is no problem on this point. However, what they are against is a true communist party, not a revisionist “communism,” and they still are using revisionism. A demand that they completely accept US leadership and completely submit to US policy would be impossible. De Gaulle would oppose it. We are quite able to use such relations within imperialism. In short, imperialist forces are undergoing reorganization.Asia, Africa, and Latin America also face such a situation. In certain places, reversals have appeared. In the past many African countries one after another became independent. By the end of last year, in all there were 36 countries that had won independence. It is an excellent situation. Now, some reversals have appeared. Tunisia, Malawi, French West Africa, and the [Moise Kapenda] Tshombe and [Joseph] Kasa-Vubu cliques in Congo (Leopoldville) have completely turned into imperialist running dogs and openly embraced imperialism. They say that the United States is not imperialism, that the old colonialism of Britain and France did them little harm, and that what endangers Africa today is China imperialism: communist imperialism. If one says that, not long after having just won independence, they also had to put up signs of anti-imperialism, anti-colonialism, and national independence, well, today such signs have been taken down. There are probably not a dozen such countries. Within those countries, there is constant resistance. The true nationalists of those countries will rise up and change situations of this kind.Burundi, under US and Belgian imperialist pressure, expelled our ambassador. Recently, a coup d’etat took place in Burundi. Burundi’s president and vice president of the National Assembly, and even the foreign minister and some ministers, directly told our ambassador to Tanzania that they want to establish diplomatic relations with China.I spoke just now of some rightist countries. Typical of them is Kenya. The parliament, newspapers, and the [Tom] Mboya group were completely under British control and in public opposition to China. They said that China’s influence in Kenya was greater and more dangerous than that of Britain and the United States. There is some reason to this. It is not completely unfounded. As the working people want thorough emancipation, this is a fundamental threat. Of course, these countries also have Leftists, who maintain friendship with China. President [Jomo] Kenyatta is right of center. Yet, he still wants China’s aid and wants Chinese carpets. We gave him three carpets, and he still wants another two. The government, and Kenyatta personally, both want China’s aid. Our aid includes not only carpets, but pounds sterling as well. We asked him about the anti-Chinese speeches. He said that it was all done at imperialist command, that it was of no importance, and that we must not regard it as important.Following national independence, there are not many cases of countries turning reactionary. Those are the dozen or so I mentioned.Foreign Minister Pak Seong-cheol: Is Uganda good or not?Chen: Uganda is in the middle.Such countries as Malagasy, Upper Volta, Senegal, Gabon, the Ivory Coast, and Burundi have turned to the right. There have only been a dozen countries that have turned to the right.A person from Upper Volta went to Mali and Guinea to see the cigarette and sugar factories established with our country’s aid. He said that it was better than British or French aid, hoped that we would also help in the future with construction, and was dissatisfied that his government’s anti-Chinese policy.These reversals are not only a temporary phenomenon, but also an advantage for this situation. The struggle can penetrate even more deeply. The newly independent African countries must be truly independent. This is the only road.In addition, some Leftist and Centrist countries are now split. Centrist African countries, after winning their independence, are still depending on imperialist and new and old colonialist loans to live. Imperialism, after granting them independence, has used a great amount of money to buy them off. They are formally independent, but imperialism has advanced its economic control of them. These countries cannot politically abandon anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist slogans, but they cannot escape imperialist economic control. Therefore, politically, they can only balance between the East and West groups. They balance between China and the Soviet Union, between the revolutionary Marxist-Leninist countries of China, Korea, and Vietnam and Soviet revisionism. They balance among Britain, France, and the United States.Politically, they cannot abandon anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist slogans. Economically, they depend on the new and old colonialisms. Algeria is the best example. They want to apply [Josip Broz] Tito’s experience -- “worker self-management” – and say that they want to follow Cuba’s path. The so-called application of Tito’s experience in reality is the political acceptance of Soviet revisionist influence. For food, they depend on the United States. Their economy depends on France. And all the oil, so much oil, has fallen completely into the hands of France. As long as France gives Algeria some money, that is enough. France can give a little every year. At present Algeria’s annual production of petroleum is more than 20 million tons. That is to say, as well, if there are several kilograms per day per person, one eats well. But they did not obtain it but gave it all away to the French. Therefore, the French every year must give some money. However, Algeria also is not willing to give up the China card. Nor can they abandon such Marxist-Leninist revolutionary countries as Korea and Vietnam. They do not dare cut themselves off completely but have to balance everywhere.Foreign Minister Pak: We know in general about Algeria’s situation. Where, exactly, is Algeria heading?Chen: This problem deserves study. It still cannot completely be seen clearly.Foreign Minister Pak: Where can it go?Chen: It seems now that [Hourari] Boumediene and [Abdelaziz] Bouteflika are one faction.Foreign Minister Pak: It is because they are a faction that they have gotten rid of [Ahmed] Ben Bella.Chen: Boumediene and Bouteflika have contradictions. Bouteflika depends on the United States.Foreign Minister Pak: Bouteflika was only 28 years old. I wonder whether he really used his own head to think, or whether there were persons controlling him from behind.            Chen: They have contradictions. Boumediene depends on France and West Germany, and the Soviet Union is also competing for him. Ben Bella’s forces still have not been completely purged. To date, there have been demonstrations for Ben Bella Algeria in Algiers and throughout the country. This faction depends on the United Arab Republic (UAR), and its relations with the UAR are very close. [Gamel Abdel] Nasser always wants to catch hold of Boumediene. Nor does he cut relations with Bouteflika. For the sake of maintaining his influence, he supports Ben Bella’s forces. As for Ben Bella’s future, it is hard to say. In addition, does he have truly national revolutionary forces? Does the faction representing Algeria’s toiling people and national revolutionary still have power? These are the questions.Foreign Minister Pak: Since Boumediene came to power, it seems that he has put forth no new policy. This being so, what is the fundamental reason for his getting rid of Ben Bella?Chen: It is personal contradictions. He is even more to the right than Ben Bella, and he hasn’t as much prestige as Ben Bella. Therefore, we have said that Algeria’s forces of national revolution in the end will rise up. Now Boumediene and Bouteflika are in constant fear of a new coup d’etat.Foreign Minister Pak: Putting it that way, Boumediene got rid of Ben Bella not because Ben Bella’s policies were not right, but due to a power struggle between the two of them.Chen: There was a power struggle. Ben Bella at one point removed from office Boumediene’s minister of national defense. However, perhaps there was foreign influence. Ben Bella’s relations with Boumediene were not good, and imperialism was plotting a coup d’etat. Also, Ben Bella did not meet the aspirations of the Algerian people’s national revolution. He had relations with the United States, the Soviet Union, and Tito. Nor did he cut relations with the Eastern countries or China. However, he is much more inclined towards the UAR. After Boumediene came to power, he blamed Ben Bella for all the domestic economic difficulties. As for foreign policy, Boumediene says that there is nothing wrong and that they can continue to implement it. He mainly has denounced Ben Bella making a mess of the domestic situation. One could talk that way about things from before June, but since June, in August, September, and October, months have passed and the domestic situation has not changed. What does Boumediene say? And next year, what should he say?Foreign Minister Pak: He said that Ben Bella's domestic policy was a disaster. What exactly was he referring to?Chen: It is not clear to us, either. But we know one point: the internal struggle is very bitter. There is a struggle within the Council of the Revolution, and Boumediene cannot bring it under control. According to the materials available to us, some of those people depend completely upon France. Some are balancing among the United States, France, and the Soviet Union. Some others are determined to proceed along the road of revolution. The three groups are not united.The foremost issue at present is that many oil fields, vineyards, and plantations are completely in French hands.Foreign Minister Pak: As far as we know, they have already confiscated from the French capitalists 300,000 hectares of land (including orchards and plantations). Have they returned them?Chen: Those lands have been nationalized. It is a fact. However, for maintenance and continued production, they must depend on French money. They also depend on France to buy the grapes planted and the wine made.Foreign Minister Pak: Can one say that selling things to France is dependence?Vice Premier Ri Chu-yeon [Ri Chu-yon]: France is choking them. Of course, they have to depend on France. They are unable to leave France.Chen: There is another problem. Since nationalization, the cadres have not been communist party members. They steal, sell things to foreigners, and enrich themselves. Originally, Algeria won its independence after seven years of bloody warfare. Implementing a resolutely anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist policy and planting the banner of revolution in Africa is easy. However, due to the absence of a strong communist party leadership, Ben Bella completely depended on playing tricks. This is also the case with Boumediene. Therefore, despite politically winning independence, economically they have fallen into the hands of imperialism. Can one say that Algerians are a nation completely without consciousness? We have come into contact with many cadres. Not a few are willing to make Algeria a national independent country. But there is no core. The biggest problem is graft and corruption. A minister can sign without other approval an agreement with a foreign country and go to a foreign country to obtain loans and do business. This is legal. So he is easily bribed by the French and Americans. A minister can arrange matters in private with West Germany or Italy, have them set up factories in Algeria, and can get food from the hands of the Americans. Thus they are bought and corrupted. Therefore, Algeria will be unable to avoid other coups d’etat taking place. Only following a few repetitions will a real national revolution be won and a real national independence be achieved. Because the population is limited, the resources are abundant, and the domestic situation is so awful, people will naturally consider this problem. This is simply our assessment.Algeria recently made a very poor show on the Asian-African Conference issue. They are thinking to hold it on their own, not needing the participation of Leftist countries. On 28 October they held a foreign ministers conference. They spoke of 45 countries, but there were only 20 foreign ministers and ministerial-class representatives. On 19 June, Foreign Minister Pak and I were both in Algiers. At that time the number of 25 foreign ministers and ministerial-class representatives had reached twenty-five. The major countries of Asia and Africa had not arrived. Among such ones as Korea, Vietnam, China, and Pakistan, none had arrived. As for Africa, Tanzania and Guinea did not go. Mali went but advocated putting off opening the conference. In the end, they themselves had to approve the postponement of the conference. Algeria said that the important countries did not come and that holding a conference with such countries as Malawi, Tunisia, Libya, and Senegal was unreasonable. They also withdrew their previous remarks, saying that friendship between China and the UAR was eternal and that we could not let differences on account of the Asian-African Conference affect our friendship. Recently Algeria raised with us their desire for a large amount of aid. We are now considering whether or not to give it to them. Their objective is not to take China’s aid. They want to use it to haggle with the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union.We once told them, you must be self-reliant. Your economic situation is the best in Africa. You can become Africa’s best country. But they are unable to carry it out.Foreign Minister Pak: Algeria has grapes, fruit, and oil, which it exports to France and can exchange annually for 250 million dollars. Using this money to buy daily necessities, can’t it get by? Why does Algeria on top of that ask everywhere for aid?Vice Premier Ri: It is mainly that those in authority have not really managed the country. They have neither experience in managing the country, nor do they have a grasp of the national economy. The ministers are thus making a mess of things.Chen: Everyone is corrupt, and this cannot be solved with 250 million dollars. A battalion commander has four cars. After the interior minister assumed office (he had previously been ousted by Ben Bella), he appointed 15 provincial governors, all of whom were his close friends and relatives. Boumediene cannot control him. [Mohamed] Yala, the ambassador to China, served as governor of the foremost province, Algiers Province, and made a fortune. He did not want to return here to serve as ambassador. Therefore, Boumediene has replaced Ben Bella. In the future, there will be some to replace Boumediene. In the end, the national revolutionary forces will again have to raise their heads.Algeria, originally a Leftist country, is now turning to the right. But the matter is still hopeful.The UAR, too, is a typical example. The UAR is now a right-of-center country. Overthrowing Farouk monarchy and waging the Suez War were both revolutionary actions. It is influential with regard to the world situation. But they also balance between East and West and between China and the Soviet Union. The UAR all along has been helping India and is close to India and Tito. Premier Zhou yesterday said that the communique of Nasser’s visit to the Soviet Union did not denounce US imperialism but only told the Vietnamese themselves to solve their own problems. On the problem of postponing the Asian-African Conference, the UAR originally agreed with our position, but afterwards also said to Algeria that they agreed with convene it. This is double-dealing. In regard to this, the UAR explained to us that they are an Arab country and have to show consideration for Algeria’s relations. They said that they were in a difficult position and asked for our understanding. In fact they are going towards the right. The UAR as a result has failed in Syria, failed in Yemen, and failed in Algeria. Because of this in the Arab world and in African countries, its prestige is becoming lower and lower. In fact, if there were no US wheat, they would have nothing to eat. That is the problem. They have already started the Aswan High Dam, for which they have to rely on Soviet aid. In technology, they rely for general industry on West Germany. The loan debt owed these countries has reached more than two billion dollars, with interest payments now 400 million dollars. But in using two billion dollars to build unnecessary things, they cannot quickly invest in production or regain the funds.When Premier Zhou June met Nasser in June, Nasser said: If now there were no US wheat, we would be unable to solve the problem of eating. Therefore, we cannot openly denounce the United States on the Asian-African Conference. We hope that China understands. He also said: Your Chinese delegation condemns the United States on the Asian-African Conference. We do not oppose it, but it is difficult for us to write on the resolution and we cannot approve it.It is the same attitude with regard to the issue of Soviet participation in the Asian-African Conference. Nasser said: Building the Aswan High Dam depends on the Soviet Union; the Soviet Union has already has already agreed to provide 40,000 tons of wheat. It will arrive in October. This is an emergency. Therefore, we cannot take the lead in opposing the Soviet Union’s participation in the Asian-African Conference, but I can assure our Chinese friends that we also will not take the lead in inviting the Soviet Union to participate. However, when Nasser at the time went to Moscow and had talks with the Soviet Union, the first item was precisely the approval of the Soviet Union’s participation in the Asian-African Conference. It went against the promise made to Premier Zhou. In the October meeting of the Asian-African Conference Standing Committee, the UAR did not agree to a postponement. It was only at the foreign ministers meeting that they were compelled to agree to postponement.Foreign Minister Pak: Algeria and the UAR indeed are in difficulty. For example, we said that it was wrong for them to ask the United States for wheat, but there was no one in the socialist countries to give them wheat, nor was there anyone able to obtain it and resolve their problem. Mali, too, is like this. The United States provided Mali eight thousand tons of wheat and two thousand tons of rice, so that country cannot very well condemn the United States.Chen: What the Foreign Minister says is quite right. I will talk about this problem later.The UAR, which overthrew the Farouk monarchy and went through the Suez Canal War, is a country that has undergone two major revolutions. It was also originally anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist. But today the UAR has economic difficulties, and the anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist slogans have become fewer. Within the country there is a serious problem, that of eating. All the factories that they build are large-scale ones requiring three years, five years, or seven years before they can be completed. After they are completed, the things produced cannot satisfy the needs of the people and cannot satisfy the needs of the domestic market. Many things also must be imported from foreign countries. These factories, in fact are going to turn into processing plants of West Germany or the Soviet Union. African countries have made beef and mutton processing plants, but the people cannot eat beef or mutton. Then there is the fruit processing plant. Who among the local people eat so much fruit! The fish processing plant, of little use for the domestic market, needs to go to Europe to find markets. But Europe and Eastern Europe block them. Therefore, these factories not only cannot play a positive role in regard to their national and independent economy but can cause an opposite effect.Nasser said to me: Our country is now is experiencing a good deal of domestic difficulty. In the world there are many books. There are books on socialism. There are books on capitalism. There are none on the transition from capitalism to socialism. Can't you Chinese write a book on transition? With such a book, we would then do it easily. I said: The book cannot be written by others. You must write it yourselves, according to the needs of your own people for food to eat and clothes to wear. There is less need to do large-scale industry. First do agriculture, pay special attention to foodstuff. Then pay some attention to small and medium factories, with one year for going into production and two years for recovering your investment. Owing others more than two billion dollars in debt, you could declare that you are not going to repay it. That way, your situation immediately could take a turn for the better. In addition, you must not send troops to foreign countries to no purpose. It costs too much. A book? You don’t need others to write it. It would be better for the President himself to write one. After I talked to him, he withdrew his troops from Yemen. The UAR’s troops in Yemen cost 50,000 pounds sterling a day. They weakened the economy. How is that sustainable! Recently, the UAR changed its prime minister. [Ali] Sabry was appointed the new vice president, on account of [Zakaria] Mohieddin serving as prime minister. Mohieddin is even more to the right than Sabry, and his relations with the United States are particularly good. In short, the UAR in June was to the right of center. It has now turned further to the right.These two examples can explain the situation of countries situated in an intermediate state. In these countries, the domestic situation is really a mess and corrupt. They do not understand how to do construction. In contracting foreign debt, counter to their expectations, they have harmed themselves. In order to receive foreign aid, they have had to lower the anti-imperialist banner.Foreign Minister Pak: I once talked with persons of the UAR. They said that the United States, the Soviet Union, France, and China all wanted to provide aid. I asked them: Having borrowed so much, what will you do in the future? They said, in the future there will always be a way to resolve it. In any case, once the dam and factories have been built, all of them are on Egypt’s land, and no one can move them. I asked if there were some way of handling it. They said that in the future when the regime is changed, the persons involved will no longer be there. We will then not acknowledge the debt. On hearing this talk, I paid no more attention to them.Chen: Foreign Minister Pak asked a good question. Asian and African countries are in an intermediate state. All of them have this problem. Imperialism gave them loans and pressured them. Unable to resist, they lowered the anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist banners. Even if you raise such banners, you are unable to do so for long. However, within the country there is also pressure. They are unable to satisfy the demands of the people, the people and the military cannot go on, and there will then inevitably take place a revolution. This is now brewing, it is exactly this. Either it will be the agents of imperialism who come to power, and it shifts even more to the right, or it will be the people who rise. It can only go towards the right or towards the left. Preserving the current situation is only a matter of time and cannot be preserved a long time. It has been 10 years since these countries won independence, and it is still like this. Therefore our policy is to hope that they continue to oppose imperialism and colonialism and find some ways to economic construction.In September this year, I met Bouteflika in Algiers. He spoke to me most frankly. He said: Your Excellency the Marshal, you must know that the problem for the countries of Africa is that of bread, not problems of anti-imperialism or anti-colonialism. That is to say, so long as the Americans and Soviets give him a little bread, he will not oppose imperialism or colonialism. I said: Yes, we Chinese cannot give you bread. The amount of bread that the Soviets give you, too, will not be much, because they themselves do not have much bread. The Americans can give you a little. The problem is that Asian and African countries must make their own bread. This is the main thing. I also said to him: You raise a good question. The problem of bread is an important one, but depending on the United States to give you bread is temporary. It can help you for the time being, but over the long term will not work. All the countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America have asked that the United States solve the problem of bread, but the United States is also unable to solve it. You have to make your own bread. For the first few years at the start, of course there will be difficulties, but after doing it for several years you will have you will find some way, and then there will be bread to eat and no more depending on imperialism.Therefore, in Asian and African countries, domestic problems are naturally the most important ones.How are they to solve domestic economic problems? On the trip this time I visited such countries as Mali, Guinea, the UAR, Algeria, Syria, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Sudan. In Guinea, the debate was very fierce. In Mali there was not much debate, but I finished by speaking of economic issues. Guinea’s administrative expenses account for 70 percent of the country’s budget. I told them that China’s administrative expenses only account for 28 percent, less than 30 percent. There is a great danger in exceeding 30 percent that you will be unable to do any construction. You must tighten these expenses. Compressing them to less than 30 percent would be beneficial. Their first problem is graft, waste, and corruption. I once told Mali: The cloth, food, and daily necessities that China has given you, after reaching Mali was not used in your domestic market but immediately flowed to Upper Volta and Senegal. This is speculation and profiteering. There is no strict control of foreign trade, and there is also heavy consumption in automobiles and gasoline. This is terrible.Vice Premier Ri: It is like buying water from France to drink!Chen: An ordinary cadre has a car. I told them: Only we ministers have cars. Assistant ministers and division directors do not have cars. Everyone takes the bus, which carries more people.Foreign Minister Pak: In Korea we all take the No. “11” (meaning to use one’s two legs to walk).Chen: Regarding these problems, our friends in Mali were all receptive and said that I spoke well. I also said: You need to engage in agriculture, engage in land reform, and distribute land among the peasants, who would then have the motivation to produce. Once they themselves are producing food, you do not have to import it. You can both save foreign exchange, and the situation can also immediately take a turn for the better. They said that they could accept all the ideas, with the exception of this one. They expressed their opposition right then and there. They also said: What you say is quite right, but it is this is not compatible with Mali’s situation. In fact, the rulers all are large landowners and large ranchers. I said: We do not interfere in your internal affairs, nor do we understand Mali’s situation. It is just that after the land reform in China, peasant enthusiasm to produce increased, and the food problem was solved. Now we have a little food and can eat half our full, but we still cannot eat our full. It is not easy. China’s population is so large that if we asked others for food or went to buy it, no country in the world would generously give it to us. There is not such a large amount of food that can be given or sold. After land reform, China started to solve the food problem on its own. The result is that we have mostly solved it, and things are much better.Our friends in Guinea and Mali are determined not to admit that their countries have a land problem. Our friends in Algeria have said: We have implemented nationalization and the land problem was solved early. In fact, it is difficult to talk about this problem. After nationalization, the peasants do not have land and still do not dare occupy it. Everything produced was taken away from them. Of course, they do not dare say anything. Therefore, they have had no choice but to turn to foreign countries to solve their food problem. Of these countries, one is a problem of foreign policy, and the other is a problem of domestic policy. The core problem is one of land reform. Domestic policy has improved, and foreign policy can also be strengthened. Raising the banners of anti-imperialism and anti-colonialism in foreign affairs can both stimulate the deepening of revolution at home and can in turn again push them to raise higher the banners of anti-imperialism and anti-colonialism. In this way, the two are combined.I said to [Ahmed Sekou] Toure: You must pay particular attention to domestic problems. He said that there were no problems at home, none at all. But he just as soon as he went to participate in the Asian-African Summit, a coup d’etat took place in his country. Although the coup d’etat was suppressed, how can he say that there are no problems? When I see him in the future, I may ask whether there are any problems in his country or not. My talk with [Modibo] Keita caught his attention. Venality, corruption, and speculation and profiteering have not been purged. If he does not mobilize the masses through land reform, in the future they will turn to subversive activities. Imperialism wants to overthrow your anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist struggle for power by means of corrupt and thieving or speculative and profiteering elements. One cannot build a Great Wall between foreign and domestic policies. The two are inseparable. To oppose imperialism and colonialism resolutely in foreign policy can shield the domestic revolution’s deep penetration. Conversely, it will also advance the struggle against imperialism and colonialism. Why must China resolutely oppose US imperialism? For the sake of foreign and domestic requirements. With an anti-US policy, you can unite all the people of the country. Domestic industrial and agricultural construction, and cultural construction, all have opposition to the United States as their aim. Because they are bourgeois, it is not good to say clearly that this is for world revolution. If you speak of world revolution, they will be afraid. Therefore, I only say that we support the national revolutions of the people in Asia, Africa, and Latin America and that we support the struggle against imperialism and colonialism. The domestic requirement is to raise the people’s standard of living. But we have a global requirement. It is not only taking note of the issue of the domestic standard of living. There is also the obligation of world revolution.Centrist countries, as well as Algeria and the UAR as representatives, may continue to turn to the right. The also may for quite a long period maintain their intermediate state, balancing in all respects. Of course, if they were to solve their domestic difficulties, they may also turn to the left.About the issue of the Asian-African Conference: More than 40 countries, more than 20 foreign ministers and ministerial-class representatives gathered together. With the anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist banners being the main ones, they cannot discard these banners. At the meeting of the Standing Committee on 25 October, Algeria peremptorily made a ruling and insisted that the conference should be held as scheduled. The proposal of China and Cambodia was turned down. Of 15 countries, only China and Cambodia voted to postpone holding the conference. In fact these two votes represented the view of Korea, Vietnam, and Pakistan. We all advocated postponement. But Algeria, in spite of all this, at the instigation of India and Indonesia, insisted on the holding on the 28th the meeting of foreign ministers. In regard to meeting on October 28, at first only Mali resolutely advocated a delay. On the last day, the number increased to 17 countries, and there emerged a proposal of 17 nations to postpone holding the meeting. These 17 countries are all major ones. Algeria was forced to accept it. Other countries have followed. India, too, had to say that it was in favor of postponement. Clearly, Asian and African countries do not fully meets the requirements of imperialism and colonialism. In the entire Afro-Asian world, the appearance of a dozen imperialist and rightist puppet countries is not the main thing. The main thing is that anti-imperialism and anti-colonialism. Anti-imperialism and anti-colonialism cannot be changed. The Centrists at present also cannot abandon the banners of anti-imperialism and anti-colonialism. Even the UAR in the end also joined the 17-country proposal on the Asian-African Conference.Among the Asian and African countries, a dozen or so are turning to the right and turning into puppets, but most of them are in an intermediate state. What stands out is that at present there are a dozen or more countries resolutely in opposition to US imperialism. This represents the aspirations of the people of the whole world. The deepening of the struggle is a very important development in the current situation. Within China there is this point of view: There are now many countries openly running towards imperialism, not opposing imperialism and opposing China. There are some countries that are opportunistic, so the situation has deteriorated. We do not see it that way. The main thing is that there are many countries that are turning to the left.To look at the trends in Africa is to look at Tunisia, Malawi, Algeria, and the UAR, as well as to look at Guinea, Ghana, Tanzania, Mali, and the Congo (Brazzaville). To judge the trends in revolution, we must see the minority at the beginning. In one country, in the whole world, it is the same. In the October Revolution, there was only one Soviet Union. Seen in terms of numbers, there is only one country, but we say: Human society has hope. This minority represents the aspirations of all the people of the world. Facts have proven that one Soviet Union has developed into the socialist camp and influenced the national independence movements of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Therefore, one cannot judge the trends in Africa as a whole on the basis of a few rightist countries and wavering countries. In Asia, there is Korea, China, Vietnam, Pakistan, and Cambodia. In Africa, there is Tanzania, the Congo (Brazzaville), Mali, and Guinea. Today what is most important is the Vietnam War, opposing US imperialism, and pushing forward the current situation. In addition, there is also a large number of intermediate countries, such as Nepal, Afghanistan, Syria, and Iraq. It is still quite a good situation. Therefore we say that, on the basis of the general requirements of anti-imperialism and anti-colonialism, we in China, Korea, and Vietnam must work more through bilateral and multilateral relations, isolate the Rightists, and hold the Asian-African Conference when the conditions are ripe. In this way, the Bandung spirit can still be promoted and developed. Therefore, pessimistic conclusions cannot be drawn. Splitting from the Asian-African Group is a good thing. We are now explaining this in China. In our country there are some democratic and rightist elements that are loudly clamoring. We recognize that there have been reversals in some countries. But such reversals are a prelude to progress. If we recognize this split and separate out the bad elements and unsteady elements, revolution and Asian-African solidarity will really appear.The Asian-African Group, the socialist camp, and the international movement all must undergo a process of recombination. If we were to be naïve and think that the all the independent countries of Asia and Africa were thoroughly revolutionary countries, that would be too simple. The Korean comrades understand the situation in China. China has passed through the Xinhai Revolution, the Great Revolution, the Civil War, and the War of Resistance against Japan, in the end striking the United States and the Jiang [Chiang Kai-shek] Gang. In 1949 we achieved victory. Afterwards, we also experienced the Korean War. Now we are also going through the ordeal of the Vietnam War. Where has it gone without a hitch? Everything has gone along a road of twists and turns.How can Asia and Africa, with a population of 2 billion people and more than 60 countries, not pass through a road of twists and turns? China, its population of 600 million, 700 million people only one small part, has also gone through a road of twists and turns. How can Asia and Africa, with their population of 2 billion people and more than 60 countries, not do this? They will certainly have to pass through failures, splits, and repetitions. Only after a long period, a struggle in depth, and passing through twists and turns can we achieve victory. China has passed through 45 years. For the countries of Asian and African countries, with their population of 2 billion people and more than 60 countries, there have been only 10 years from the Bandung Conference to now.Foreign Minister Pak: We completely agree with what you say about revolutionary truth and the road of revolution. Revolution in Asian and African countries must pass through twists and turns and repetitions. It cannot be achieved in one go. The problem now is that the Asian-African Conference has been delayed indefinitely. How will we do our work henceforth regarding the reactionary, right-turning, and Centrist countries? Are there some guidelines and methods?Chen: We want to do the work through bilateral and multilateral approaches. We do not carry out denunciations against Centrist and wavering countries. Moreover, we must help them well. Against the rightist, anti-communist, and anti-popular countries, we must still speak out against imperialism and colonialism, thereby exposing imperialism and colonialism. For example, we can tell such counties as Tunisia and Kenya: In your countries, there is no threat from the communist party. Mainly, there is the threat of imperialism. Nor are we a threat to you. Your accusing us is empty talk.We very much appreciate what Vice Premier Ri Chu-yeon [Ri Chu-yon] has said: Even if once again the result is ruin, we must strike down US imperialism. It is the same with us. We do not fear ruin. We must fight against US imperialism to the end.Foreign Minister Pak: In this respect, we are all in agreement. The conference has been postponed. There are some Asian and African countries who when they come into contact with us will ask: Why? When will it be held again? Next year or in three years? Do we say that we must watch the situation? Wait for the conditions to be ripe to hold it again? How do we consider that the considerations are ripe? What conditions? What is China advocating?Chen: We in China see it this way in regard to this issue: This postponement is an indefinite delay, but the Standing Committee of 15 countries in Algiers still remains. The Standing Committee can continue discussing the issue of holding the conference when the conditions are ripe. India wants to get rid of the Standing Committee because, once rid of it, the conference will not be able to be held. Most countries advocate maintaining the Standing Committee. This is a victory. “Wait until the conditions are ripe.” They will ask: What conditions? First, the majority of countries must openly condemn the United States. There is widespread opposition to imperialism and colonialism, and even the United States is in favor of it. It would be meaningless to holding something like the Arab summit or African summit. The Arab summit conference is held every year. What’s the point! Therefore, we must work and wait for the anti-US conditions are ripe for holding the conference again. The United States madly carries out a barbaric aggression and will cause such a situation. Second, the greatest obstacle – the puppet group -- cannot participate. South Korea, Saigon, Malaysia, and [Joseph] Kasa-Vubu are all imperialist puppets. We cannot sit down and hold a conference with imperialist puppets. Third, Algeria must withdraw its invitation to U Thant. China, Korea, and Indonesia sit down with the United Nations and hold a conference? In the Standing Committee, Algeria said: U Thant has said that he would not come. We said: It is only that U Thant has said he would not go. You must withdraw the invitation. Your inviting U Thant is a violation of the Bandung tradition. The Bandung tradition has nothing to do with the United Nations. Fourth, the Soviet Union is a European country. It cannot participate in the Asian-African Conference. It is mainly these four conditions.Foreign Minister Pak: If more than 60 countries are against the United States, then when will the conference be held? There are some countries, such as India, Japan, and Thailand. When can they be against the United States? The revolutionary struggle, apart from those countries, is won. As a result, is it not a long delay?Vice Premier Ri: We need to see the anti-imperialist mainstream. It mainly indicates when the anti-imperialist forces have the upper hand and are dominant.Chen: It is very difficult to estimate when the conditions would be ripe. Sometimes it is very quick, and sometimes it requires some number of years.Foreign Minister Pak: Yes. If Asian and African countries ask, what will you do?Chen: The work of us Leftists is very important. However, next year they will certainly hold the Third Non-Aligned Conference, avoiding China, Korea, Vietnam, and Pakistan. Our assessment is that most Asian and African countries will participate, and it will also include Tito, Cuba, and the UAR. That conference will not condemn US imperialism, nor will it take any firm position on the Vietnam issue. If they give that kind of performance, on the contrary it would beneficial to us. At that time, the Centrist and Leftist countries will feel the need to hold the Asian-African Conference. It is because that [non-aligned] conference will not solve any issues. It is a defense of imperialism. I have a positive view: Perhaps after the Third Non-Aligned Conference is held, the conditions can then be ripe for holding the Second Asian-African Conference. They put a great deal of emphasis on the so-called “Third World” and attempt to exclude the socialist, Leftist, and anti-imperialist countries.Foreign Minister Pak: There are some persons who say that since at present all the Asian and African countries do not get together, do not hold a conference, and cannot obtain a consensus, it would be better to hold a real conference of anti-imperialist forces and not let participate those countries that do not oppose the United States. How do you see it?Chen: I, too, would like to consider this proposal. If there are a dozen or more countries that think this way, we could raise this issue. It would be better for a national independent country to put it forward.Foreign Minister Pak: They asked us: Regardless of the form, would it be good or not to hold such a conference first?Vice Minister Zhang Hanfu: It was Cambodia that proposed it.Chen: I agree. I told them: We are not against you doing it.The present situation in Indonesia, too, is very important. You may understand the Indonesian situation a bit more than we do. Our embassy basically cannot operate.Vice Premier Ri: We, too, do not understand it.Vice Minister Zhang Hanfu: You had some living quarters searched.Vice Premier Ri: Yes.Chen: Indonesian Army Rightists and Islamic reactionary forces, under the command of the US [Central] Intelligence Agency, oppose the communists and the people. They are now conducting a sweep of the whole country and implementing a white terror.Such Centrists as Sukarno, Subandrio, and the Indonesian National Party [PNI], still want to prevent Indonesia’s right deviation and want to adhere to a policy of opposition to US imperialism. They say that they want to maintain the Jakarta - Phnom Penh – Hanoi – Beijing –Pyongyang axis. To date they have been unwilling to declare the Communist Party of Indonesia [PKI] illegal. They may severe diplomatic relations with China. China’s ambassador has seen Sukarno several times. With regard to our Commercial Counselor's Office, experts, and the consulate in Medan being attacked and searched, Subandrio has apologized and sent back the national flag and national emblem. Sukarno a few days ago asked that China please understand and that we give him some time. He also said that he could still control the situation.Ambassador Pak Se-chang: We have just talked of the issue of a conference of anti-imperialist forces. As a founding country of the Bandung Conference, won't the participation of China in such a conference cause misunderstanding? If such a conference were held, wouldn't it bring about a split among Asian and African countries? If a split appeared, wouldn’t it be even more disadvantageous for us?In addition, how likely is it that the Soviet Union will participate in the Asian-African Conference? Will they see it through to the end? Or will they drop their demand?Chen: We are not a founding country of the Bandung Conference. The founding countries were the Five Colombo Countries. As Comrade Ambassador said, our participation in such a conference would cause some misunderstanding and would be somewhat disadvantageous. The Asian-African Conference at the start was a comparatively broad meeting of an anti-imperialist united front. As in the response I just made to Foreign Minister Pak, we must carry out multilateral or bilateral activities. This is the main thing. When [Prince Norodom] Sihanouk raised this issue, I said to him: It is necessary that we resolutely anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist countries draw near to one another and explain to each other. However, if we want to hold a formal international conference, the more participating countries the better. If not, we would be at a disadvantage. Therefore, none of our press or authorities speak of a “joint axis” or holding separate meetings. If they want to speak, then let them speak. We assess that future changes in the Vietnam situation, the Indo-Pakistan situation, and the situation in Asia and Africa will create the conditions for holding the Asian-African Conference.The Soviet Union’s new leaders will not abandon the idea of forcing their way into the Asian-African Conference. This is their capital, and they are using this capital. This time, when 45 countries met in Algiers, at least 30 countries opposed the resolution on the participation of the Soviet Union participation. Only six countries, led by India, advocated the Soviet Union's participation. One day, the Soviet Union will be forced to withdraw its request.Foreign Minister Pak: In my view, there are some people who have advocated the Soviet Union's participation to destroy the Asian-African Conference, sow confusion in the meeting, and make everyone quarrel.Chen: Today, the PKI and Indonesia Leftists are rallying their forces. They are active in many mountain areas. From the rightist reports, we see that the United States and the Indonesian Army feel that this is a thorny issue.Foreign Minister Pak: Aren’t there any Leftist reports?Chen: There are not.Foreign Minister Pak: Our embassy has not reported, either.Chen: Many members of the PKI have come to China and asked us. We do not [understand] the situation, either. Recently some persons came from Jakarta. They knew only of the situation in Jakarta. They did know the situation elsewhere. Sukarno is now making every effort to control the situation. He hopes that the Army and the Rightists will not continue to oppose the communists. He also hopes that the PKI and Leftist forces will not respond with armed force. It is said that it is up to him to solve the situation. The United States, the Army, and the Rightists will certainly not abandon their opposition to the revolution and certainly will thoroughly continue to do so. However, the Americans and the British have also warned the Army and the Rightists: You must continue. In the future there may appear a second Vietnam tragedy. Therefore, they too are afraid and are wavering. With regard to the fighting in the mountain areas of Central Java and East Java, they are at a complete loss as to what to do. Within the Army there are those who are passive and also those who are PKI sympathizers. In fact, the Army and the Rightists only are in control of Jakarta. Control of the villages and mountain areas is in the hands of the PKI. It is such a form. Sukarno wants to mediate, under his control, but there is less and less room to maneuver. We have been cooperating with Sukarno now for more than 10 years, since 1955. Our policy towards him has had an impact on our relations with Asian and African countries. Therefore, we are not now attacking him in the press or criticizing him. We have said to him: The attacks and the searches of our Commercial Counselor’s Office, experts, and consulate are a card. We have given you this card. You take it and go suppress the Army and the Rightists. This will become support for you. He is very grateful. Yesterday there was information that [General Abdul Haris] Nasution gave Sukarno a letter that he had written. He called on him not to serve as prime minister and to yield the post, that he only serve as president in the form of the British queen, without power, that he act as a puppet. Then, that he conduct a purge among 100 ministers. Third, that he must appoint more military men as ministers. This information is reliable.Foreign Minister Pak: Is it said that the PKI is to be disbanded?Chen: That is another condition.A few days ago, Sukarno through Subandrio told our ambassador: Sukarno is immediately to withdraw the Army’s authority. He is confident of success.Foreign Minister Pak: He is the supreme commander. How will he reclaim authority?Vice Premier Ri: He does not have real power, so he says that he must withdraw that authority.Chen: It is now a showdown of Nasution and Suharto with Sukarno. There may be important developments. Subandrio said to our ambassador: The Rightists also want to stage a coup d’etat. Sukarno must take action. Sukarno announced in a speech on the 6th: The ministers must make the ultimate sacrifice for Indonesia's revolution and must not fear death. The two sides are heading for the final showdown.Foreign Minister Pak: No one listened to his talk. How much power does he really have?Chen: There are forces of his in the Army.Vice Premier Ri: The people, too, broadly support him.Chen: The problem that he now faces is: either step down as prime minister and serve as a president in the manner of the British queen – a puppet – or the Rightists have him leave the country (he has prestige in the military and in the country, so he may go abroad as president). Then there would be a civil war waged between the Leftists and the Rightists. If the situation would prove irreparable, he would then return to put it in order. Another possibility would be completely eliminated. The Army is determined to dismiss and replace Subandrio. Sukarno is resolutely opposed. The situation in Indonesia ultimately will be determined by the armed struggle of the PKI. This is the main thing. The exact situation at present in East Java, Central Java, and Sumatra is not clear. Of three million PKI members, it will be enough if there are several tens of thousands resolute ones.Foreign Minister Pak: Has the PKI undergone such repression that there is going to turn to armed struggle, or are they thinking of another way?Chen: I see both happening. On the one hand, in the struggle in East Java and Central Java, some people went on strike, destroyed railways, and killed landlords. The Army, which had gone on a search into the mountains, was beaten back. On the other hand, however, Njoto also participated in the meeting that Sukarno held on the 6th.Foreign Minister Pak: This point is unclear. Why did Njoto want to participate in that meeting?Chen: We have no good answer for this problem. My personal view is that, if the rightist forces get rid of Sukarno, it would be a good thing. The Americans and the British said yesterday that if the Indonesian Army and the Rightists cannot solve the domestic economic crisis, the PKI would make a comeback. The price of rice since October has risen by 75 percent. The present government’s Rightists ask us for rice and cloth. We said: We have rice, we have cloth, but it is you who are against China, conduct searches, who attack our embassy and consulate. We cannot give you things. We pay no heed to your internal affairs. When the Communist Party of Burma and Ne Win fought, we paid it no heed. Members of the Communist Party of Burma live in Beijing. Ne Win also knows it. You oppose China. How can we give you rice and cloth?At present Sukarno plays a role: to ease the contradictions between left and right. But in the end it also depends on the PKI’s armed struggle. This will be decisive. The PKI, most resolute in its opposition to imperialism and revisionism, will certainly be able to stand this test. We are speaking frankly to our Korean comrades. To oppose resolutely the Army and the Rightists is to support the PKI and Sukarno. The Korean press has been coordinating well. The Japan Communist Party, Albania, and Vietnam all have been coordinating well. Clearly, the united front is of no advantage to the PKI. We must turn resolutely to armed struggle. This is the main aspect. As for why Njoto was sent to participate in the cabinet meeting, I do not know. Was it for Njoto and the Murba Party to organize a sham communist party? This, too, is unclear. Sukarno, if he were truly to unite with Nasution and take such a step, then the last lid would be opened. The PKI then takes the road of armed struggle. At that time, the situation will be clear. In November and December, the situation can finally be clear. However, the PKI in the end will certainly move to armed struggle. This belief is unwavering.The Americans and the Army, the Rightists, are shaken. They are always publicizing that Comrade [D.N.] Aidit has been arrested, that he has been surrounded, all of which is false. For a month now, they have been constantly doing such propaganda, attempting to shake the people’s confidence. If they could capture him, they would have done so long ago. Untung [Syamsuri] is very determined. He has said that his September 30 Movement will surely succeed, and if they kill him, he will certainly succeed.Foreign Minister Pak: Has Untung really been arrested?Chen: Yes. This is what he said at his trial. The Rightists and the Army do not dare to try Untung publicly. Untung said: Because the Army organized the Council of Generals and were going to stage a coup d’etat, he had no choice but to take action. The Army said: Produce the evidence. He said fine, let Sukarno attend the trial and I can then produce the evidence.Vice Premier Ri: Is there a relationship between Untung and Sukarno?Chen: It was Sukarno who wanted Untung to do it. Sukarno did not dare attend the trial, and the Army for its part did not dare hold a public trial. Untung had several reasons: First, my September 30 Movement is opposed to a military coup d’etat. Second, my movement represented the broad demands of the junior officers and soldiers of the three military services. You generals have several wives, live in houses, and drive cars while I, a battalion commander, sleep on the floor. My September 30 Movement has two objectives. The first is to protect Sukarno and safeguard the revolution. The second is to oppose a coup d’etat, oppose the United States, and recover the Army’s honor. The Rightists used severe electrocution, but Untung did not capitulate. The Army has made this information public.Vice Premier Ri: Heroic.Chen: In the Army are persons who have made this situation public, which shows that in the Army there are persons who sympathize with Untung and support Sukarno. If not, they would not have made public something disadvantageous to them.In the PKI there is a mix of Sukarno’s people with persons from the Army and Rightists. In the Army there are Sukarno’s people and PKI members. In the end, it is not clear. It will only be clear in a few months. With the failure of Sukarno’s mediation, the PKI has started large-scale counterattacks and the situation has become clear.Vice Premier Ri: It is Indonesia’s political system, society, and economic setting that made Untung and others turn to revolution. It has nothing to do with Untung as an individual, but the background producing a revolution.Chen: Entirely correct. Indonesia’s extraordinary revolution is unavoidable. No matter what the United States and the Rightists do, no matter what Sukarno’s tricks, “walking the tightrope,” nothing can solve the problem. Indonesia is now on the eve of great storm and a great revolution.Foreign Minister Pak: Was Untung executed by shooting?Chen: He was not. They did not dare hold a public trial and did not dare execute him by shooting. They wanted to use Untung against the PKI, but Untung said: I am not in opposition. I sympathize. That was good. It seems that within the Army there were persons protecting Untung.Ambassador Pak Se-chang: In view of the trend in the development of the situation in Indonesia, will Sukarno be able to leave the country or not? That is to say: He wanted people to be faithful to him as president for life, but he himself retreated and dodged, letting the Leftists fight. When things were difficult in 1948, he hid overseas.Chen: There is this possibility. There is also the possibility of his being ousted, leaving the country, and then regaining power. The situation in Indonesia is a reversal, a split, but it is a deepening, not a regression. Imperialism is very happy, but they have become happy too soon.Foreign Minister Pak: The situation in Indonesia shows that the PKI and the [indistinct] class cannot co-exist. A peaceful transition is impossible.Chen: Correct. Many Asian and African countries have such a PKI situation. Leftists and Rightists cannot co-exist. Imperialism wants to hatch plots. The people are dissatisfied and want revolution.The overall situation is that various forces have again reorganized, combined, underwent divisions, split, and headed for victory. The powerful forces against imperialism and national revolutionary forces in the end will obtain victory.Vice Premier Ri: I have heard your very valuable views. The analysis is exceptionally profound. Imperialism must perish. We must win. Although the road has twists and turns, we are always optimists.Chen: Korea, Vietnam, and China must prepare for isolation for a time. In fact we are not isolated. Indonesia had better drive out our ambassador. We are waiting for this day. In this way, here is hope for Indonesia’s revolution. China is not willing to be the “cotton.” When the Leftist and Rightists fight, we will of course not mediate. We hope that they fight.(Premier Zhou enters. After a break the conversation continues.)Premier Zhou (hereafter, “Zhou”): I first will answer the question that Vice Premier Ri posed yesterday.The US Air Force is divided by three methods of calculation. In total there are 29,500 aircraft classified as military aircraft. Of these, 3,600 aircraft are held in reserve (reserve aircraft) in preparation to supplement when combat losses are suffered. In active use are 25,900 aircraft. There are not many combat aircraft, only 6,000. The distribution ratio of these 6,000 aircraft is: nearly 1,000 bombers, a bit less than the 5,000 combat aircraft. The greatest number is in everything else, which accounts for more than three-quarters of the total (transport aircraft, helicopters, patrol aircraft, aerial refueling tankers). Less than a quarter is really fighting. In Vietnam, how many aircraft of the Navy and Air Force are there? What we know is the same as what the Vietnamese comrades tell us: 2,700 aircraft, accounting for less than one tenth of the 25,900 aircraft in service. But these 2,700 aircraft, too, are divided into combat and non-combat aircraft. There are 780 combat aircraft. The Vietnamese comrades originally told us that there were 770 aircraft. At present it has already increased to 780 aircraft. This accounts for only 13 percent in comparison to the figure of 6,000 aircraft. Of the rest, helicopters are the most numerous, at 1,000. They are used everywhere to transport persons and things. The remaining 900 aircraft are transport aircraft. They transport things from three bases: Guam, Okinawa, and the Philippines’ Clark [Air Base]. In addition there are also aerial refueling tankers, ambulance aircraft, as well as patrol aircraft used for maritime patrols. Less than a third of the 2,700 aircraft are actually fighting. These aircraft are divided in three local administrations.The Navy’s aircraft carriers have 700 aircraft, divided into various aircraft (small bombers, service aircraft, etc.). The Army has 950 aircraft, with service aircraft the most numerous, mainly helicopters and trainer aircraft. The Air Force has only 1,000 aircraft. This shows that combat, too, is divided. In south Vietnam, [General William] Westmoreland is in command. The Navy does not fall under his administration. The Air Force cooperates with him. Therefore, if a combat aircraft is lost, it must be replenished from the United States. Losing so many, they have to take them from the reserve aircraft. In this way, there is a panic in aircraft orders as well. Although orders were placed, production was not forthcoming, and replenishment was naturally difficult. In addition, US aircraft are deployed at military bases throughout the world. I do not know whether or not you have this material. I will send it to you tomorrow. Although the air power in Vietnam does not exceed 15 percent, replenishment has been constantly difficult and has required transfers from elsewhere. More fatal has been the replenishment of pilots. The United States has an authorized strength in pilots of 75,000 to 79,000. A single pilot cannot fly a transport or a bomber. Therefore, after losses, there is difficulty in replacing them. For air losses in general, the rate of injury is higher than the mortality rate. Recently, however, many aircraft have been shot down at low altitude over North Vietnam, and the death rate has grown. Because of this the United States has set low-altitude flights from 500 to 1,000 meters and wants to avoid radar detection. However, North Vietnam has many plains and few mountains. Actual flights are from less than 500 meters to 1,000 meters. Therefore, when the US pilots carrying out bombing missions are very timid and afraid to die. Shooting down aircraft at such altitudes is very easy. Without using anti-aircraft guns, one can shoot them down with machine guns and rifles. If struck, the pilots bail out. They will either suffer heavy injuries or die. At an altitude of only 500 meters, the insurance factor is too little. In fact, no matter what the bombing, it will be unable to resolve the fighting. The United States also recognizes this point. Without occupying territory, how can one resolve the war? At present, the United States’ most massive air forces have grown weaker in Vietnam. This is a threat to the United States. Dependent on air superiority, the United States dares not envisage expanding the war of aggression against Indochina, striking China, and even striking Korea. This is because maintaining constant superiority over a large area would be impossible after an expansion of the war. There are persons in the United States who advocate an expanded war against China, mainly in depending on air power, but they face the opposition of many persons.In addition, the United States has four air bases in south Vietnam. We can have a map brought this afternoon for reference. Other than these four bases, the United States also uses aircraft carriers and naval air bases, as well as four bases in Thailand. These are the ones at short distance.Comrade Vice Premier also asked about the situation of Vietnam’s air supremacy. Vietnam’s air power now has grown stronger since the enemy started bombing last year. At present Vietnam has 104 combat aircraft and eight Ilyushin IL-18 bombers. There are 20 aircraft in China for training and preparation for future use. In the Soviet Union are another 36 aircraft that have not yet been transported. The total number of aircraft is 168. Of course, if necessary, this number can be supplemented. China can add to it, and the Soviet Union also should provide some. In addition are more than 60 transports, helicopters, and trainers. Vietnam now has five airfields available. We are now helping to build one. We are also preparing to build another two. However, relying at present on air power, there is no way to fight the United States in the air. Moreover, there are not many Vietnamese pilots. Some of them are still in training in China and the Soviet Union. Therefore, there is not aerial combat each time the enemy comes. It is necessary to look for an opportunity and see a gap for a surprise attack. Some air fields have often been bombed and often repaired. Only two large air fields, including Hanoi, have not been bombed. We have an agreement with Vietnam: If an airfield is bombed and aircraft cannot land, they may land at our country’s airfields in Guangxi and Yunnan. But such a situation has not yet happened. This shows that there are not many air battles and not intense. One can say that Vietnam’s air combat is one of guerrilla war, looking for gaps and opportunities, then suddenly engaging the enemy. Since the United States has been bombing North Vietnam, Vietnam has downed or damaged more than 600 enemy aircraft in all. They have mainly relied on ground fire, with very few aerial shootdowns. Ground fire has mainly shot down low-flying bombers. Most numerous have been shootdowns by 37mm anti-aircraft artillery, machine guns, and rifles. Missiles have downed few aircraft. The United States knows the position of some missiles, but the Vietnamese comrades have adopted a method of moving them from place to place. The enemy often misses them completely or hits dummy missiles. The advantage of moving the missiles is that the Vietnamese comrades can strike the enemy, but the enemy cannot strike them. Vietnam’s plan for air combat mainly relies on ground fire. They plan first to shoot down 1,000 aircraft, then shoot down another 2,000 aircraft.I have been talking just now about north Vietnam. In addition, recently we had a reporter go to south Vietnam and talk with intelligence personnel. They believe that, with continued fighting, victory is certain. We will send you later this material, which has important state of affairs for military operations, for the reference of Comrade Premier. In it is new material worth studying. In the past both you and we have engaged in guerrilla warfare. Now they are engaging in guerrilla warfare and creating some new methods. The Vietnamese comrades have told me that they are prepared to continue sending troops into south Vietnam. After this past visit of the Vietnamese party and government delegation to the Soviet Union, in passing through Beijing on their return to Vietnam, they said to us: They did not discuss Vietnam’s combat issues with the Soviet Union, telling only China and Korea about their plans for military operations.So much for this part. Do you two gentlemen still have any questions?Vice Premier Ri: We are fine. No more questions.Zhou: I will add something regarding the Indonesian problem.Sukarno sent us a telegram, to which we replied. The incoming telegram and our response have been brought here and will be delivered to you in a little while. At present Indonesia’s Leftists and Rightists are already fighting at close quarters. The Rightists oppose the communists and the people. In regard to us, on the whole they oppose China and exclude Chinese. In essence, they are against the communists and against the people. But we in our hearts have emphasized their opposition to China and exclusion of Chinese. We have said: We believe that both Sukarno and Subandrio wish to be friendly with China and maintain relations. In past broadcast speeches he has said so, and he has said so recently as well. The Vice Foreign Minister, who came here on his return from Algiers, also said so. But the Rightists, in complete opposition, have thoroughly destroyed relations between both countries. Such incidents as assaults against and searches of the Commercial Counselor’s Office, experts, and the Medan Consulate have come one after the next. They have gone as far as holding anti-Chinese meetings. On the other hand, they have been persecuting overseas Chinese, burning houses, arresting people, and stealing things. Sukarno has said to us that he hopes that we give him some time and that he is in difficulty now. He has also spoken this way to the PKI. However, the time has already passed. We talked to him. He only shook his head and sighed. It was the same with Subandrio. We said that the only is to concentrate you firepower and attack the Rightists, otherwise there would be no way for us to support them. We pointed out that the Rightists have all along been using various means to foment conspiracies, not hesitating even to break off diplomatic relations and all trade relations with China. On the surface they want to buy food from China (through Subandrio), but in fact the United States has given him things. One line is selling him food through Thailand, which in fact is a loan. Another line is to give him a loan via Japan. The loan conditions, naturally, are very harsh. The Rightists have already seized power. The military and economic power are both in the hands of the Rightists (not all the troops are Rightists). Third Deputy Premier Saleh, who visited Korea and with us also signed [an agreement], said that it sounded very good. We ceaselessly told Sukarno and Subandrio about these things. It is hard to say what Sukarno in fact can do. As I see it, there is not much leeway. In particular Subandrio, at times treating us lightly, is afraid of ruining relations. Of course, the Rightists also want to get rid of him. Once they are rid of him, Sukarno then will have even fewer people around him and will become even more isolated.Subandrio told us that Sukarno would issue a statement on 10 November to remove wartime controls and recover power. In fact, on the 9th there was held a reactionary rally demanding the PKI’s dissolution. On the 10th, it was said that the matter could be considered. It is completely the opposite approach.We have not received any information on the PKI’s present situation. Our embassy and consulates, as well as those of Korea and Vietnam, are all under surveillance and are in a poor position to have contact with the PKI. If we do have contact, relations with us are not much, and PKI members run the risk of being arrested. We generally know that in Central Java there is indeed an armed force of more than 10,000 people. Rightist forces are not dominant. Those resolutely opposed to the communists and the people do not dominate. The rightists are now desperately trying to catch Leftists floating on the surface and are purging Leftist forces within the military. The Leftists, too, are organizing their forces. Leftist forces probably are in Central Java, East Java, and North Sumatra. There are also some forces in East Kalimantan, Southwest Sulawesi, Maluku, and West Irian. It seems that the Leftists are waiting for the Rightists to attack, are waiting for Sukarno to be gotten rid of, or have completely turned into tools of the Rightists.Our policy is divided into two parts. The first part is the issue of Indonesia’s revolution. Vice Premier Chen Yi has already said that armed struggle between the Leftists and Rightists is unavoidable. This is a good situation. In the world, there are few instances of 20 years of a united front. The Leftists and Rightists cannot remain within Nasakom. This trend is inevitable. Facing the upsurge of the Indonesia revolution, what is the policy of a fraternal party? There is a need to support Indonesia’s Leftists, but our proposition is that one cannot go beyond the PKI. Because the main body of the revolution is the Indonesian people, those who lead them are Leftists. We cannot exceed our place and meddle in the affairs of others. Our support is merely action in concert with them. What the PKI advocates is what we support and endorse. First, we cannot substitute for them. Second, we cannot go beyond them and cannot vie to be first. At present the PKI has not publicly called for our support, nor can we easily support them publicly. It is the same for you. At present there are some Left-wing parties that feel anxious and have expressed their views and provided ideas. This is not easy to do. Albania asked us for materials, and we replied that there are no materials. They said: You have diplomatic relations, so it is not easy to say things, but we can speak. We told them: First, we do not have any materials. Second, we also do not endorse their speaking for us or the PKI. This is our policy to support the Indonesian revolution. There are bounds, and there is also cooperation.The second part is diplomatic relations between the two countries. The main fire is to strike the Rightists, because they are against China and exclude the Chinese. Regarding Sukarno, whether superficial or whatnot, he is willing to maintain bilateral relations, and we respond to him. But there are contradictions here. The Rightists oppose China and exclude the Chinese. He wants to maintain relations. We indicated this point to him but in taking action I have not vied to be first. He takes one step, and then I take one step. It is what we have often said: gain mastery only after the enemy has struck. Our struggle with him, in tactics, should be on just grounds, to our advantage, and with restraint. On this issue, Sihanouk’s recent assessment is relatively good. Sihanouk acknowledges that the Rightists hold power in Indonesia but have a weak point: they have no roots among the people. But he believes Sukarno too much and thinks that Sukarno can change the situation. This is not allowed. Sukarno, if he is to control the situation, he must rely on the Leftists to strike the Rightists. He will have to rely on one. He cannot be divorced from reality.Sihanouk has been positive in his support of the National Front for the Liberation of Southern Vietnam (NLFSV). Recently I said to him: If the United States expands the war, expands it to north Vietnam, he leave him some space there and be advantageous to him. He was happy. He also asked us for military aid. But he does not want heavy weapons. He wants light weapons for air defense and for fighting the guerrillas. Of course, this is only Sihanouk’s own thinking. The cadres are not listening, and it is still a problem. On the other hand, he is willing to do business with the NLFSV and make money selling rice, materials, and even weapons to the NLFSV. He mainly wants to get some foreign exchange. The NLFSV has sold him some of the rubber produced in the guerrilla area. He said it was good and could be used for foreign exchange. We want to use his attitude to help south Vietnam, but we need to pay a little “toll.”Regarding the Asian-African Conference, Sihanouk has his ideas. Sukarno has said that there is a five-country “axis” [Beijing-Pyongyang-Hanoi-Phnom Penh-Jakarta] and even Saleh has spoken this way. At present this anti-imperialist “axis” has become a problem. Some conferences of anti-imperialist countries require a period of preparation and observation. Sihanouk has said to me that he had early advocated a postponement of the Asian-African Conference and, if not anti-imperialism, then how can it be held! He saw the problem. Of course, there are two sides to Sihanouk. He has relations with France, which does not want the Asian-African Conference to be held. On the other hand, Sihanouk has raised the possibility of a few countries participating in a conference of the anti-imperialist axis. I said: It would be possible to fight for convening this conference, but we have to prepare the conditions, and at present the conditions are not ripe. How are we to create the conditions? With advanced bilateral exchanges, by supporting Vietnam as the central problem, we see how many countries support Vietnam, how many are consistent, and how many are basically the same. We will speak again of advanced bilateral and multilateral activities, when conditions are ripe. Because the revolution has deepened, many members of the ruling class have grown afraid, and they must split.Recently, rulers of Asian and African countries most fear being overthrown by revolution from below, although they once rose up and overthrew others. [Alphonse] Massamba-Débat of the Congo (Brazzaville) is exactly so. When the mass struggle develops and deepens, if rulers dare to approach the masses, the anti-imperialist movement will develop further.Judging from this general trend, the people’s struggle has deepened. This is good. However, the bourgeois rulers of Asian and African countries also must undergo trials, splits, and reorganizations. In a certain period of time, the Asian-African Conference will not be held. Therefore, there was nothing to do but to postpone it indefinitely. Everyone approves, Leftists and Rightists both agree, which proves the need to postpone it. There are people who want to hold it. They are a minority.In this time of great turmoil, great divisions, and great reorganizations, although there have been fewer meetings, the struggle has been fierce, and there remains much work to do. Let us speak again of a situation. Last night we saw material concerning the Organization of Solidarity with the People of Asia, Africa, and Latin America (OSPAAAL) conference, to be prepared in Havana in December and held in January next year. Algeria's foreign minister said to Vietnam’s Comrade Hoang Van Tam that the Havana meeting could not be held. His reason: The six Latin American countries that Cuba has proposed are all rightist and revisionist. This is indeed the case. Because, since holding the Havana Conference of Communist Parties, Cuba has brought in revisionism and sent away persons advocating armed struggle. Is not Cuba now openly replaced with the United States? More than 6,000 Cubans have already gone there and in the future still more will go. A considerably large number of them have signed up to go to the United States, not several thousand but several tens of thousands.Algeria's foreign minister said: In such a situation, the conference cannot be held in Havana. Even if it is held, the Leftists will be unable to go. He urged the Vietnamese comrades that they participate in the preparatory conference and make the conference impossible to hold. The Vietnamese comrades sought out our embassy to consult. It may be that Algeria was not really searching us out and intended to divulge to us via the Vietnamese comrades. We are still considering this issue.Why is Algeria this way? There are two assessments. (1) There are only two ways to go to Cuba: via Moscow or Prague. But both ways are restricted. Persons who do not welcome Cuba are not issued visas. Some Latin American Leftists previously in Havana are not allowed to go. This is a fact. (2) There may also be this aspect: The United States fears the holding of the OSPAAAL Conference and add a new banner, which will have an effect. Conferences of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization (AAPSO) conference have gone well, and they indeed have been disadvantageous to imperialism. The United States, which has cut off Latin America from Asia and Africa, now fears that Asia, Africa, and Latin American will link together. Therefore, the United States has been attempting via Algeria (Bouteflika’s relations with the United States and the United Nations are good), to use language of the Left to attain its objective of the Right.Foreign Minister Pak, you have seen Bouteflika. That man, via U Than, has relations with the United States. I am almost certain that the invitation for U Thant to participate in the Asian-African Conference is not from Ben Bella, but from Bouteflika. Ben Bella told me in person that it was Bouteflika who did it. He wants a way to solve this difficulty. After Ben Bella was overthrown, they said that it was Ben Bella who asked. Our Ambassador Zeng Tao was not tactful. This issue was raised in the Standing Committee. The Algeria Foreign Ministry was greatly irritated and thought that Ambassador Zeng Tao should be expelled. The reason is that he spoke of its sore spot.With regard to the assessment of the Algerian coup d’etat of 19 June, we believed the words of the UAR and assessed it as good. Our assessment was wrong. Leaders of Asian and African countries in London at the time, as well as the leaders of some black African countries had their doubts about Boumediene and, in particular, Bouteflika. They were right. We should be frank. If we know something is wrong, then we admit it. In this struggle, the attitude of Boumediene and Bouteflika is much worse than that of Ben Bella.Foreign Minister Pak: I said to Vice Premier Chen Yi at the time that Bouteflika was a bad person, and Vice Premier Chen Yi said he was a good person.Zhou: Not only did you have your doubts, but Comrade Nguyen Duy Trinh did as well. When I later saw Comrade Nguyen Duy Trinh, I said to him: You were right, and we were wrong. Foreign Minister Pak’s doubt was also right. We should frankly admit that this was a mistake. In Africa, we have also admitted our mistake.Chen: In any event, we have to examine it. My think that Bouteflika certainly will be first to fall from power.Zhou: Perhaps, but not necessarily.Chen: It is not only a problem of Bouteflika alone. We were wrong with regard to the entire coup d’etat of 19 June.Zhou: During the African Summit, once we admitted this, many African countries that are friendly to us were very happy. Boumediene completely failed. Our frank attitude won over many countries. Boumediene personally went to Accra and failed completely. Toure, [Julius] Nyerere, Massamba-Débat, [Kwame] Nkrumah, and others joined together to question Boumediene. All the African subcommittees did not choose Algeria's participation and blocked it. At that time, Nasser changed his tone and said it could not be discussed at the foreign ministers conference discussion, but only in the Standing Committee. Therefore, Boumediene rushed back on the 24th. They themselves held a three-day meeting and discussed the issues of a postponement of the Asian-African Conference and relations with China. In the end they in fact themselves decided to agree on a postponement. With China, they still want to maintain relations. Boumediene is isolated in Africa. Of course, Comrade Chen Yi said that the future depends on development. This also shows that the struggle of the people of Asia and Africa is profound. We have work to do. We have to do a great deal of work and engage in more bilateral contacts. The theme is to speak of Asian-African solidarity under the banners of anti-imperialism and anti-colonialism, with the Vietnamese issue at the center.As for the Conference of Newly Emerging Forces, if Sukarno is brought down by the Rightists or turned into a puppet, it will naturally collapse.We will study the OSPAAAL Conference and other issues, put forth some views, and exchange them with you.Well, then, these are our views on the three issues. If you have other issues, we will have another exchange in the afternoon.Vice Premier Ri: Comrade Premier is very intense.Zhou: They gave me a name: intense for a lifetime.CC: Politburo Standing Committee; Peng Zhen, Chen Yi, [Li] Xiannian, [Luo] Ruiqing, Fang Yi, Li Qiang, Confidential Affairs Bureau, General Office, CPC Central Committee; Office of Foreign Affairs, CPC Central Committee (2), International Liaison Department, CPC Central Committee (2); Ministry of National Defense (1)Zhang; Ji; Wang; Qiao; Han; Gong; Huan; General Office, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (1); Second Asian Affairs Department, Ministry of Foreign Affairs; 5 file copies; 32 copies printed in totalReceived on 15 November 1965     Submitted for printing on 16 November 1965General Office, Ministry of Foreign Affairs   Printed and distributed on 16 November 1965\n",

      "According to the information I received from a Vietnamese source, problems have occurred in DRV-DPRK trade and in the field of Korean aid shipments. (In 1974, DPRK exports to the DRV stand at 120.000 rubles, while its imports are 300.000 rubles. In 1974, the value of Korean aid is 2 million rubles; if the delayed shipment of earlier aid supplies is included, it is precisely 3 million rubles.) It has very gravely affected the DRV that the DPRK has not supplied yet any chemical fertilizer. There are also delays in the supply of steel, non-ferrous metals, and other raw materials. The Korean side claims that the delayed shipments are caused by domestic difficulties and transport problems. The Vietnamese side tacitly disapproves that in 1974, the DPRK exports substantial quantities of rice (e.g., to Indonesia), but it does not sell or supply rice to the DRV.T.  \n",

      "On the visit of DPRK Deputy Premier Jeong Jun-gi:The visit had primarily political objectives. From the Ethiopian and Korean sources, which confirmed each other, the following information has been obtained:Both sides expressed their readiness to develop their political relations. To achieve this aim, they considered it necessary to clarify a few delicate political questions.The Ethiopian side raised objections to that the DPRK continued to maintain good relations with Somalia. The Koreans stated that their relations with Somalia were based on tradition, but they had disapproved Somalia’s attack on Ethiopia. For this reason, since then they have discontinued their material assistance [to Somalia]. Due to the division of Korea, they cannot go further, because they need the widest possible support to their policy [of national unification].The Ethiopian side also raised objections to that the Koreans supported the Eritrean separatist movements. The Koreans assured them that since the revolutionary takeover [in Ethiopia], they had discontinued their support to the Eritreans. The Korean delegation raised the question of why the South Korean embassy in Addis Ababa was still in operation, albeit [the North Koreans] had been given a promise as early as two years before that the Ethiopians would take measures to close it. The Ethiopian negotiating partner once again declared that they analyzed the Korean question from a class perspective, their relations with the DPRK were given absolute priority, and they would “restrict” their relations with South Korea, but they needed to wait until the time was right for such a step.   As is shown above, both sides dealt with these delicate issues in a very cautious way, appropriately evading frankness. Nonetheless, one can expect a gradual improvement of relations.11 – T.\n",

      "In recent times, the strengthening relationship between North Korea and Ethiopia has appeared in an unusually spectacular form. For days on, the television shows the film about Mengistu’s extremely spectacular reception in Korea in sequels. On his way home, the president was accompanied by the Korean vice-president, who since then has been visiting various facilities in the companionship of Mengistu. This delegation, composed of a high number of members, will stay here until the CC [Coordinating Committee, a.k.a. Derg] session that is expected to be held in early December.The Koreans provide assistance on a very wide scale:  A high number of small-scale irrigation facilities, a larger hydropower station, geological surveys, military equipment, marine fishing, and so on. From an interest-free loan of six million dollars, they are constructing a shipbuilding factory. The Soviet experts in the Ministry of Agriculture have been largely replaced by Koreans. These contacts reinforce the cult around Mengistu; in my view, it is not the ideological and political identification [with North Korea] that is important for the Ethiopian side but the fact that they regard the development of this country, which is comparable to theirs, as a model applicable [to their own conditions], and that they really receive great assistance. Of course, this might also open a way for an increasing political influence.114 – B.   \n",

      "From a recently published speech of Mengistu, who is still touring the country in the companionship of the Korean vice-president, it has become clear that now he actually harbors even more grandiose dreams of industrialization than before the congress. It seems that this speech illuminates what has been hitherto incomprehensible in [Ethiopia’s] relationship with Korea. They probably cannot expect the Soviet Union to support these plans, and thus the propaganda also occasionally alludes that as far as industrialization is concerned, they rank Korea ahead of the Soviet Union. It is unlikely that they can easily launch these plans, since under the conditions created by the famine, many sensible and realistic conceptions for agricultural development were conceived. However, there is a danger that in the next year, the Western counties—if they become aware of this new line—will be reluctant to provide food for the famine-stricken people, whose number is expected to be, even in the government’s estimate, close to six million. 115 – B. \n",

      "No. 14378 October 1950    16:30I report:On 8 October 1950 at 12:30 local time Kim Il Sung invited me and Shtykov to have a conversation.During the conversation, Kim Il Sung said that at 6 o’clock on 8 October 1950 the ambassador of our friends came to him and delivered to him a ciphered telegram in which it allegedly briefly stated:1. The friends will commit troops, though the number is not specified 2. Send to Mukden [Shenyang] a representative from Kim Il Sung in order to decide matters related the decision of our friends3. To describe the situation on the front and in the region where the troops of our friends are concentratedThe commander will be Peng Dehuai.Kim Il Sung is dispatching Pak Il-u to Mukden without delay in order to resolve the specified matters. The latter will be in Mukden on the morning of 10 October 1950.Kim Il Sung assumes that the friends will give no less than 12 units.Based on this, it has been decided to ask the friends for three units from the region of Ganghwa-Jin-an and by combined march send them to the region of Genzan-Kanko [Wonsan-Hamheung].Three units – to the region of Anju. Their aim—to guard the coast in that region from naval landing parties.Maintain six units as a concentrated force, amassing them, for now, in the region of Northeast Anju. Following their use—depending on the situation, to the time when they are fully concentrated.It is hard to establish the time it will take to concentrate them, but we can guess, that in the region of Anju, they will gather within 7-10 days. In the region of Genzan-Kanko [Wonsan-Hamheung] it will take no less than 12 days.In connection with this, would it not be expedient, for the purpose of having an organized deployment of the troops of our friends into battle, for me and my group to go to Andong in order to provide assistance to the friends. With the help of “BODO,” a connection with Moscow can be established in Andong.Matveev\n",

      "Top Secret8th Directorate of the USSR Armed Forces General StaffCable Nº 75511To Cdes. Shtykov and Vasil'yevRead the following to Kim Il Sung:\"Yesterday a meeting of representatives of the VKP(b) CC Politburo and representatives of the Chinese Communist Party CC Zhou Enlai and Lin Biao was held in the USSR on the issue of action by Chinese troops to help Korea. From the report of Zhou Enlai it became clear that the Chinese troops destined for Korea are not ready to act, have no tanks and very little artillery, protection from the air cannot be provided in less than two months, and that more than six months will be required to supply [them] with tanks and artillery considering the training of the troops in armor and artillery matters.In view of such a report by Zhou Enlai the meeting unanimously recognized that China can only provide aid with troops after six months.Since such aid is belated and it can only arrive after the occupation of Korea by American troops the meeting came to the conclusion that given their technical weakness and unpreparedness the Chinese forces cannot have success in Korea at the present time but, on the contrary, will find themselves in a critical position.In view of all the above the meeting of the representatives of the Chinese and Soviet CC's recommend:1. To immediately begin the evacuation of Pyongyang and other very important locations without any sort of panic;2. The Korean people's forces are to make a fighting retreat to the north, delaying the enemy, and not letting him quickly branch out to the north;3. Concentrate part of the troops in the mountainous regions north of Wonsan and Pyongyang, forming a strong defense there, and send the other part into the rear of the enemy in small detachments for partisan warfare [delo];4. Send the mobilized Koreans to form new reserve divisions across the Chinese border to Manchuria in small groups and form divisions from them there (the Chinese comrades have agreed to this);5. Send the transports that arrived with the Soviet weapons which have still not been used by the Korean comrades into the service of the Korean divisions being formed in Manchuria;6. Put all Koreans studying in the USSR into aeronautics and organize air units from them which will get aircraft from the USSR;7. Either send all Soviet advisers to the USSR or use them to form new Korean divisions in Manchuria, as Kim Il Sung sees fit.You are informed that Cde. Mao Zedong agrees with the opinion of the meeting and approves it.Nº 4/8737 Fyn Si12 October 1950Copy Nº 1 - to Cde. Vasilevsky; Copy Nº 2 - to Cde.

October:“All personnel from the North Korean Embassy in Oslo have been declared unwanted in Norway. They have been ordered to leave the country within six days.The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has taken this measure after receiving a police report proving the civil servants of the North Korean Embassy have been involved in extensive illegal import and distribution of spirits and cigarettes.This afternoon, Secretary General Sverre Gjellum summoned North Korea’s Embassy Counsellor and chargé d’affaires in Oslo, Pak Gi-pil [sic], to inform him of the police report, and declared the Embassy’s personnel persona non grata in Norway and asked them to leave the country.”Furthermore, the Police Chief in Oslo has issued the following press release: “The Police Security Service launched an investigation of the North Korean Embassy after receiving informations from contacts in the Nordic countries. The investigation has revealed that the North Korean Embassy in Oslo has been running an extensive operation involving the sales and distribution of spirits and cigarettes, which has been sold to Norwegian citizens.This information led the Oslo Police Department to take action on 15.

      "Minutes of the First Meeting between Premier Zhou Enlai and Nehru(Unverified)Time and Date: 19 October 1954, 7:00 pm to 11:30 pmVenue: Xihua Hall, Zhongnanhai Interpreted and Recorded by Pu Shouchang Nehru: I have received a piece of news. Yesterday, the parliament of the French territory in India held a vote. One-hundred-forty-eight members of the parliament voted in favor of Indian independence, while eight members voted against it. Prior to that, India had reached an agreement with France, but France insisted that they go through a legal procedure like a vote. In about a week, India can sign a treaty with France, and in ten days, India can take over the regions held by France. Zhou: Great. This is another good deed of the French cabinet. Nehru: This has been made possible for two reasons: First, the economic situation of the French territory is extremely difficult as most material supplies have been cut off, and almost half of the region is virtually in a semi-blockaded state. And second, the French cabinet has resolved this issue. Zhou: What is the situation in Goa?Nehru: Not much has changed. What is the situation in Macao?Zhou: It is the same. The only difference is that Portugal has diplomatic relations with India, but not with us. Nehru: Although Portugal has diplomatic relations with India, India has recalled the diplomatic representative in Portugal. Portugal’s diplomatic representative remains in Delhi.When the Portuguese first arrived in Goa, they introduced extremely ruthless methods. Like what had happened in European countries, the Catholics and Christians carried out brutal slaughters. Many people in Goa were forcibly converted to Catholicism. (Nehru went on to talk about the various regions in India. Details omitted.)Chairman Mao said this afternoon that America has air-dropped special agents into China. How is this situation?Zhou: Most of the special agents are Chinese, but they have been trained by America. Most of the special agents have been selected from Taiwan; some have been selected from Chinese prisoners of war [POWs] taken during the Korean War. Nehru: Did the American planes fly in Chinese airspace?Zhou: Yes. The planes flew at high altitudes. Most of them were four-engine B-29 aircrafts. Nehru: Were there many intrusions?Zhou: There have been many intrusions since the end of the Korean War, but they have become less frequent this year. We have conducted a count. We can send you a copy. This afternoon Chairman Mao mentioned the provinces over which American planes flew. One of the provinces is Qinghai. In the past, there were some bandits fighting us in this province. As such, America air-dropped radios to these bandits in order to establish contact, and some weapons, such as machine guns and ammunitions, were also air-dropped. Special agents were air-dropped as well. America did not stop air-dropping until they had wiped out these bandits. America has also air-dropped special agents into the forests in our country. We have captured some of them. Among these special agents, thirteen are American. We are going to make an announcement soon. Nehru: When did you capture these American special agents?Zhou: The year before last. Nehru: How is the situation on Jinmen [Quemoy] Island?Zhou: Some days ago, Jiang Jieshi [Chiang Kai-shek] bombarded Xiamen from the air and by artillery on the island. We counterattacked by artillery. Lately, the situation has not changed much. It is just that the bombardment has become less frequent. Yesterday, Jiang Jieshi’s aircrafts again flew over Xiamen, but did not drop any bombs. Nehru: What do you think their purposes are, Mr. Premier?Zhou: Since the armistice in Korea last year and especially since peace was restored in Indochina, they have been using the outlying islands to carry out disruptive and sabotaging warfare. They know that if they send troops to the mainland, they will get annihilated. Thus, they are carrying out disruptive and sabotaging warfare; they hit and run. They carry out looting, arson, and killing. They control the Taiwan Strait, preventing our ships from going through the waters off the coasts of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong provinces. Foreign ships passing through the waters also face the risk of being impounded, and therefore have to take detours through the waters east of Taiwan. For this reason, many foreign ships do not come because freights are too high. They have various purposes. First, they are using disruptive and sabotaging warfare to cooperate with the sabotage carried out by the air-dropped special agents on the mainland. Second, they want to disrupt our sea transportation. Third, they want to cut off our trade with foreign countries. They are attempting to take advantage of all this to create a tense situation. This is America’s policy of threat. After the Korean armistice and the restoration of peace in Indochina, America wants to expand its aggression, train Jiang Jieshi’s troops, and make preparations for expanding the war. Nehru: Clearly, their activities are aimed at causing disruption and inflicting harm. Mr. Premier, do you think this is a prelude to America’s attempt or plan to launch a major war, or is it just to cause disruption with no intent of a major war? Zhou: Let me put it this way. The disruptive and sabotaging warfare today is intended for a bigger war tomorrow, but we cannot say that what is going on today is the prelude. However, if we do not block, oppose, and strike this disruptive and sabotaging warfare, it will expand day by day to the point that we cannot distinguish the above two stages. In China, there is a saying—“Give him an inch, and he will take a foot.” If this happened, the disruptive and sabotaging warfare would expand. Nehru: Mr. Premier, is America deliberately provoking the Chinese government into some action in order to get an opportunity to expand its military operations? Zhou: America does not want to instigate a major war right away; rather, they are testing the waters to find out if we are prepared and if we have the strength. At the same time, they are giving Jiang Jieshi’s forces a boost. Jiang Jieshi’s forces are aging, and his troops on the islands are also exhausted. Therefore, America’s instigation of disruptive and sabotaging warfare has given Jiang Jieshi’s forces a boost; otherwise, Jiang Jieshi may face an internal change, and his forces may completely lose their combat abilities. But the boost America has given to Jiang Jieshi’s forces has created another problem; that is, after getting the boost, Jiang Jieshi’s forces want to expand the war, attack the mainland, and instigate a major war. But this conflicts with American intents, as America today has no plans to wage a major war. What will happen tomorrow will be a different story.Under such circumstances, we are supposed to put forward our proper proposition and prove that we are prepared and will not tolerate aggression. We have full justification to liberate Taiwan. We will not tolerate aggression; we will not tolerate disruption of our marine transport and our foreign trade being cutoff; we will not tolerate a “neutralized” Taiwan, “international control,” etc. Therefore, we have taken the initiative to bring up the issue. Otherwise, America will not only use Jiang Jieshi to wage disruptive and sabotaging warfare, but also hatch other plots around the world in order to keep its tight grips on Taiwan. Nehru: Undoubtedly, as far as Taiwan is concerned, both the legal basis and the historic basis are favorable to the Chinese government. Previously, I thought that after experiencing the Korean War, America did not need any further evidence of China’s strength to resist. This is a rather difficult issue—how to cope with the current situation without triggering a major war. Zhou: How do you look at the situation in the Far East and the world?Nehru: As I have just said, on the Taiwan issue, the legal basis is on the Chinese side. This is quite clear. The current issue is a practical issue, that is, how to deal with the current situation. You’re right—America has no plan for a major war, but there are all sorts of people in America; some of them often want war, while others do not. Those who want war can find a pretext to get others to become involved in the war. The American government is weak now as it is wavering under pressure from all sides. For example, the China Lobby is a powerful group. Groups like this can affect the result of the election. On one hand, we should not fall into the trap of the war hawks; on the other hand, it is difficult to keep silent and be submissive to what is going on. This is a difficult situation, and I cannot give any opinion. I just hope that the situation will not escalate into a major war as it would be catastrophic to all people concerned, and it would mean falling into the trap of American warmongers. Copies of the telegram you sent to the United Nations [UN] Secretary-General have been distributed at the UN, and the Soviet delegation has recently proposed a motion. I do not know at which organization the motion will be discussed. If the motion is tabled for discussion, it will definitely fail. This is because the motion condemns America, and few countries are willing to directly condemn America. Rejecting this motion will allow America to directly obtain support. However, I am not quite sure how the matter will evolve at the UN. I have been told that regarding China’s admission to the UN, if the idea had been put forward in the final stage of the current General Assembly, there would have been hope of success, but it was put forward in the early stage of the General Assembly before all preparations had been made; thus, it failed. Zhou: Since Prime Minister Nehru mentioned the international situation, I also want to say something about our position. First, during our talk four months ago, we said that our policy was aimed at international peace and cooperation. We will do everything we can to fight for peace. We have reiterated that the peace and cooperation we talk about do not exclude any country, even America, as long as these countries have the same wish. Second, we must make it clear that we will not tolerate any bullying. But America not only refuses to recognize us, but also air-drops special agents and uses Jiang Jieshi to carry out disruptive and sabotaging warfare along our coast, disrupting our marine transport and cutting off our international trade. As such, we have to make a call of justice and propose to liberate Taiwan. If America continues provoking and bullying us, we will definitely resist. As Prime Minister Nehru said to Chairman Mao this afternoon, we are not afraid of threats either. Third, we will never engage in provocation; we have no intent to instigate a world war as it would run counter to our policy stated in the first point. On one hand, we want to liberate Taiwan; on the other hand, we will be very cautious if we were to take any action. Regarding the two points made by Prime Minister Nehru about the UN, I also want to say something. The charge we filed at the UN is just. It is not going to produce any results given the current situation at the UN. We do not expect any result. We just want to find out how much response we can get from our call of justice. Whether a world war will be waged or not does not depend on the UN, but on America. Whether the motion will get passed at the UN also depends on whether America will approve it or not. I am not quite sure how the Soviet Union’s motion will be resolved, but China is in the right. So, we want to see who in these countries sympathize with justice. This will be a test of all countries. On the other hand, if America uses the Taiwan question to mobilize other countries to wage a major war together, it will definitely fail because America has no justification on the Taiwan question. Therefore, there is no justification to go into a major war along with America for the sake of Taiwan. But we have to be prepared. If America uses Taiwan and the outlying islands to attack the mainland, we will resist, and we are ready to fight with our lives. Regarding China’s legal status at the UN, it is not a question open to discussion. However, as long as America opposes it, we can never get in. Therefore, regardless of how early or late the idea is proposed, it is not going to get passed now. But this issue is also a test of the countries that recognize China. Although they are fully aware that it will not get passed, they do not dare express their position. This is not something we will accept. Whether it is in the current general assembly or the next one, as long as America opposes it, no other country can do anything about it, because most countries are following America or simply do not dare go against America. Nehru: Thank you for giving me a full explanation of your viewpoints. I would like to talk about the last issue, that is, China’s status at the UN. I agree that this issue should be brought up from time to time, even if it will not be passed considering the current situation. My only concern is how it is brought up. If the issue is brought up for the purpose of gaining something, then no country should be put in a position that goes against their will. The differences of practice have something to do with the matter in question. We agree that this issue should be brought up from time to time. It is right to bring up the issue this year. I just feel that maybe it should have been brought up at a later date, but anyway this is only a question of tactics, not a question of principles. I completely agree with most of what you have said. On one hand, it is not necessary for me to reiterate that the legal, logical and historical basis is in favor of China on the Taiwan question. Three or four years ago, even the American government said so. On the other hand, no country would accept bullying; even small countries would not, let alone big countries. Any country would give up their rights and claims just because they are threatened. You said that China will not do anything that runs counter to its purposes of peace. This is something with which I completely agree. As for the statement, what should be done? I certainly cannot put forward any suggestion. I am not quite clear about what is going on at the UN. But given the current situation, any motion opposed by America will not get passed. But it does not matter whether it gets passed or not. What we should try to do is to isolate America, like what was achieved to some degree at the Geneva Conference, in order to make it hard for America to promote its policy. You know the policy followed by India is to find a way out and resolve the difficulty. To a very small extent, India has made some achievements. The reason is that India wants to avoid getting involved in the dispute and does not side with any party. Only in this way can we exert our influence. I want to ask a question—at the UN or elsewhere, to what extent can we be of service? When we take the initiative to provide assistance, if we do not take a definitive and tough stance at the UN, things will be easier. Otherwise, we cannot keep our status as a mediator. America’s foreign policy is, to a large extent, determined by its domestic politics. At the present, all depends on next month’s election. I am not saying that the policy will have a fundamental change, but the inclination is likely to shift. At this moment, all political parties are busy with their campaigns. After the election is over, we will know whether a political party in favor of peace or a political party inclined toward war is in the lead. It will be easier to adopt an appropriate policy by that time. I do not know how the UN is going to evolve, but the main question is how to prevent war without abandoning the principles. I feel that the world is becoming increasingly averse to war. The Geneva Conference enhanced this tendency. We should take advantage of this tendency and prevent warmongers in America and elsewhere from instigating war. I have something else to discuss with you, but I do not want to keep you up the whole night.(After discussion, it was decided that the meeting would continue at 3 p.m. the following day.)Zhou: Just now, Prime Minister Nehru made a few points about the UN. I want to make two points. First, India has taken a neutral stance on many issues in order to facilitate the handling of international disputes and to realize humanity’s common wish for peaceful coexistence, that is, the Five Principles. This is something we understand. We hope that in the current international environment, India and China can do more promotional work. In this sense, if America agrees to peaceful coexistence, we will not reject. If America is unwilling to have peaceful coexistence and wants war instead, then we will isolate America. By “isolation,” I do not mean launching aggression against or inflicting harm on America. Nehru: It is to isolate America diplomatically.Zhou: Right. It is to isolate America in terms of its war policy, not to isolate the American people. But two problems would arise here. First, if America launches aggression against us, for example, if America uses the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization [SEATO] to launch aggression against India, India cannot remain neutral and will have to take a stance. It is for this reason that the Prime Minister has expressed opposition to the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. We welcome this stance. Nehru: “Neutrality” is not a good word. My policy is not neutrality. Regarding the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, we have made clear our opinion. Concerning America’s military aid to Pakistan, we have also voiced our opinion. As for other matters, we have expressed our opinion as well. We will continue to clearly express our opinion. We’re not taking a weak, passive neutral stance. But if we want to do something constructive, we have to make our opinion clear and make sure none of our actions prevents us from getting the assistance we hope for. Zhou: It is a question of methodology. Nehru: Yes. We avoid using [illegible] to offend other nations. Sometimes, we also use tough words, but we always express our opinion in a friendly fashion. What we oppose is a certain action rather than a country. Zhou: The second issue is the Taiwan question. This is a complicated issue. America takes deliberate steps to create tension in the Far East and would not allow the post-Geneva Conference situation to ease further. America wants to create a situation in which, if we take actions to oppose America’s aggression, America will assert that we made the situation tense; and if we do not take actions to oppose it, America will push Jiang Jieshi to expand his disruptive and sabotaging warfare. If someone comes forward to mediate, America will suggest that both sides discontinue military operations. In this way, America will get Taiwan and legalize its occupation of Taiwan. This issue is rather complicated. We cannot talk about it anymore today. We will continue tomorrow. In a word, our basic position has been made clear. We have made a call of justice to the UN. The UN cannot claim that it is right for America to occupy Taiwan. If it does claim so, the UN will have no justice to speak of. It will completely lose its prestige in front of the people all over the world. Nehru: I do not want to mediate on the Taiwan question. Zhou: During its visit to China, the British Labor Party delegation discussed with me at length about the Taiwan question. Although they did not explicitly state their intent to mediate, mediation was implied. Nehru: I do not intend to accept the status quo of Taiwan, either, as it would mean allowing Jiang Jieshi to carry on. The question is, at the UN and elsewhere, what steps can be taken to isolate America diplomatically? Although America is powerful and belligerent, if it is isolated, America will find it difficult to act. We are trying to find a way to create a situation in which America will feel isolated. Some European countries are isolating America in private, though they do not say that publicly. We are also trying to find ways to influence Burma and Indonesia and to influence European countries, though to a small extent. At present, Jiang Jieshi is continuing his attack with American support. If the UN calls for an immediate armistice so that there can be a period of time to think peacefully about how the issue can be resolved, it can be an indirect condemnation of America’s and Jiang Jieshi’s war acts. Mr. Premier, do you think attack and counterattack would hinder peace? Or should we think peacefully about how to resolve the issue?Zhou: Statements like this would only make the issue more complicated. The outlying islands have a direct effect on the living of all our fishermen. The occupation of the outlying islands and the Seventh Fleet make us vulnerable to the risk of our international transport and trade being cut off, not to mention the infringement on our sovereignty. If both sides were to stop, it would be tantamount to recognizing the status quo, and we would suffer. If both sides were to stop, it would certainly mean legalizing America’s occupation of our territory. This is not something we can tolerate. In fact, their presence is a threat to us. Even if both sides stop, America would not cease using special agents to engage in aggression against China. Even if we expose it, they will not admit it. One point must be made clear. Any action we take is part of our domestic affairs, but any action taken by America would be an interference with our domestic affairs. Only by applying this criterion of right and wrong can we isolate America and compel it to stop meddling with the outlying islands and Taiwan. But considering the way that America has been running amuck, it is not going to stop immediately. Therefore, America should be isolated so that it cannot go on. This is going to be a long-term struggle.\n",

The issue was featured on the front page of the Washington Post dated 22 October* with a report from the newspaper’s Tokyo correspondent. In addition to accounts of the events, the Post writes that Scandinavian countries have normally sympathized more with North Korea than with its bitter rival in the south, but much of this goodwill has now suffered from the revelations of the illegal smuggling.The article also refers to North Korea’s failure to pay foreign entities, and views the illegal distribution of cigarettes, spirits and narcotics in light of these failures. According to the article, Japanese trading companies are pessimistic in their view of North Korea’s economic future as they are seeing a collapse in industrial management. One example mentioned in the article is a Finnish paper mill purchased two years ago, which is now rusting outdoors as a factory building was never constructed.Attached is the Washington Post article.Power of attorney:Sverre StubEmbassy Secretary*Translator's Note: The Washington Post article is titled \"N.

      "notThe Korean party and government delegation headed by Comrade Pak Seong-cheol [Pak Song Chol], which arrived in the DRV on October 24, was greeted with limited enthusiasm both at the airport and the reception the Vietnamese gave that evening. The chief editor of [the North Vietnamese party newspaper] Nhan Dan, when I asked him about this issue, replied that originally they had invited Comrade Kim Il Sung, but “allegedly he has been unwell for a long time.” The Vietnamese comrades also told the Soviet ambassador that Kim Il Sung had given them to understand that as a first step the DPRK expected the supreme Vietnamese leaders to visit [North Korea], after which he might personally return the visit. At the reception given in honor of the Korean delegation, it was conspicuous that in spite of the character of the delegation (party and government delegation), only three [Vietnamese] Politburo members and a CC secretary were present. In the toasts they gave they spoke very little about inter-party relations; the Korean toast did not even mention the name of the Soviet Union, the socialist countries, Marxism-Leninism, proletarian internationalism and the importance of the unity of the socialist countries, whereas the Vietnamese toast covered [these topics]. Moreover, the Korean toast mentioned Kim Il Sung only in his capacity as a state leader.   – 232 – Jakus –\n",

      "Minutes of Premier Zhou Enlai’s Fourth Meeting with Prime Minister Nehru(Not Reviewed)Time: 26 October 1954, 3:45 pm-4:20 pmPlace: HotelChina’s accompanied attendee: Pu Shouchang (interpreter and recorder)India’s accompanied attendees: Pi-lai [sic], Nedyam Raghavan, Bai-chun-hui [sic] (interpreter)Nehru: I would like to talk with you about two or three issues.First, with respect to the Indonesian prime minister’s invitation for you to visit Indonesia, I said you had better go there after the situation was clear. I thought about this matter later. Judging from the situation, as far as I know, no new incidents will occur. So if it is convenient for you, it is worthwhile for you to visit Indonesia. Of course, it will depend on other issues.Zhou: I have talked with the Indonesian ambassador about this issue. The visit seems unlikely to happen this year because there are only two months left. In November, I have to manage work in China because I cannot manage some work, especially the Five-Year Plan, when I’m abroad. As you know, the targets for our Five-Year Plan have not been determined yet. In December, Burma’s prime minister U Nu will visit China, and the Communist Party of China will hold a meeting. So, maybe my visit to Indonesia will fall next year, and I have told the Indonesian ambassador this expectation. The Indonesian ambassador said his president would be unavailable to visit China until next year. As for the specific time, we think we may visit Indonesia first.Nehru: The second issue is only mentioned to remind you. Some changes have taken place in Pakistan. The Constituent Assembly was dismissed, and the cabinet was dismissed by the governor. The Pakistani prime minister was left in office to maintain the situation. Therefore, the political position of the prime minister has been greatly weakened. It is said that the election will be held soon. All these [circumstances] indicate Pakistan’s crisis. The third issue I would like to talk about is that Yugoslavia’s marshal Josip Broz Tito will visit India in two or two and a half months. He is of course welcome to visit India, but his visit this time is not to discuss some specific issues.Zhou: As for Yugoslavia, I would like also to air my opinion. Recently, Yugoslavia has held generally good attitudes, and it conveyed its willingness to work toward world peace. Yugoslavia also showed some positive attitudes; for example, it does not agree to European secession. Yugoslavia has expressed its willingness to establish normal relations with China, and China will consult with Yugoslavia with respect to this issue. We will not refuse but will cooperate with any country that is willing to work for world peace. Mrs. Vikram Pandit said she would visit Yugoslavia, and I hope you will motivate Tito when he visits India this time.Nehru: I would like to mention another issue. As you know, Canada made a proposal in the United Nations. Later, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States agreed to make the proposal with Canada, although the United does not attach great importance to the proposal. Now, the Soviet Union also wants to join them as a proposer. Our representative played a part in assistance, and he obtained some explanations and statements of the two parties’ stances. We offered a little assistance in a friendly manner.Zhou: This is the first time that the four powers and Canada have made a joint proposal in the United Nations with India’s assistance. This indicates that the Soviet Union has the intention for reconciliation. The United Kingdom and France hold a good attitude, but the United States holds a bad attitude even under such circumstances. We know such issues take time.Nehru: In addition, I would like to talk about the Korean issue. I have reported your opinions to Mr. Krishna Menon. I received his telegram reply this morning. He said sixteen countries were drafting a report. The report had not been signed and remained a draft. But the United States had already had some disputes with the United Kingdom and some other countries. The United States insisted that the United Nations supervise the election of North Korea, but China and North Korea will not agree to this practice. The United Kingdom hoped the United States would agree in not a very rigid way so that the United States would not be fettered by itself. We hope that the report just states the facts and makes no suggestions; otherwise, it will trigger some disputes. We hope the United Nations will avoid making any decision in this respect. We think this way will lead to success.Zhou: You mean this report will make no suggestions?Nehru: If there are some suggestions, such suggestions will be bad. This will make the United Nations admit that the Geneva Conference is continuing.Mr. Menon thinks that it is unadvisable to suggest holding another conference. Consultations shall be made before a conference is held. After the way-out is found, it is feasible to consider continuing the Geneva Conference or holding a conference similar to the Geneva Conference. But we are willing to deem that the Geneva Conference is continuing rather holding a new conference.You suggested that India attends the conference. We think it is unadvisable to take this as a condition because difficulties will arise. The best way is to resume the Geneva Conference first and then to propose suggestions at the conference rather than any country proposing suggestions.Zhou: If it is possible to hold the Geneva Conference again, the second step is to invite India and other Southeast Asian countries, and this is a good way. But this way is on the precondition that the Geneva Conference can be held again.Nehru: Our whole ideas are as follows. First, we think the Geneva Conference is continuing and has not ended yet, so this will make the United Nations indirectly accept our stance. Second, the Armistice Commission for Korea should continue to exist. Third, the United Nations should not pass any rigid resolutions or proposals because such resolutions or proposals will hinder our progress.Zhou: I absolutely agree.Nehru: You have said that the conference may be held in Geneva or New Delhi. Some difficulties may arise in holding the conference in New Delhi, and holding [the conference] in Geneva would be a better choice.Zhou: Holding it in Geneva is fine, but it does not seem proper to discuss Asian issues not in Asia but in Geneva. But we will not disagree if the two parties intend to hold the conference in Geneva.Nehru: We are willing to hold the conference in New Delhi, but we hope that misunderstandings or difficulties will not arise.Zhou: After the recent political changes, how is Pakistan’s future? Although it is difficult to make predictions, I would like to learn about your opinion.Nehru: It was recently said that Pakistan will hold an election. But in my opinion, they are not eager to do so because they want to maintain the status quo. Pakistan’s last government did so, and it did not resign until it could no longer maintain the situation. They attempted to have more time in power by promising to hold the elections soon. And the draft of the constitution has been abolished. If the election is held and is fair (this point is very important), the current leaders will suffer losses. The elections held in Pakistan in the past were corrupt and pre-arranged. But I still believe that most of the current leaders will be replaced if the election is to be held.I have had several talks with you, and I benefited a lot from these talks. I earnestly look forward to more talks with you because such talks are beneficial for mutual understanding, but maybe such talks have to be postponed until the next stage.Zhou: I hope the formalities will be stressed less in our future contacts because our mutual visits have [only] begun. Increasing the contacts between individuals is beneficial for the peace of Asia and the world at large. I hope formalities will be stressed less when I visit India next time because in this way, the contacts will be more comfortable and efficient.Nehru: You might complain, but you used so much etiquette in receiving me this time.Zhou: I am not complaining. I mean future contacts may be made more casual.Nehru: Absolutely agreed.(Premier Zhou handed over three materials to Prime Minister Nehru: maps of China’s islands which are illegally occupied by the United States and Jiang Jieshi [Chiang Kai-shek]; statistics on the invasions of the United States military airplanes into China’s territorial air space and aerial delivery of spies; and statistics on Jiang Jieshi’s marine forces invading and harassing foreign vessels.)\n",

      "received via VChfrom NEW YORK\tthe SOVIET DELEGATIONSpets Nº Nº 408-411to Cde. MOLOTOV1. Today the First Committee began the discussion of the Korean question, although it was second on the agenda. The Italian question was first, which Argentina asked to be postponed and to generally be put at the end of the agenda. It is as if they were of two minds in this matter and possibly they will remove it from the consideration of this session altogether. Dulles spoke from the US and Gromyko from us. I could not be [there] since I have had the flu for three days now, although yesterday I was in the Committee all the same since I considered it impossible to be absent at such an important meeting.  Gromyko made a statement in accordance with your instructions (your telegram Nº 267) and introduced our proposals about the withdrawal of troops at the beginning of 1948 and allowing the Koreans to decide the question of a government themselves, and also proposed inviting the Koreans to take part in the discussion of this question in the First Committee in the Assembly. TASS is also reporting our statement about the meeting.On 29 October these proposals of ours will be discussed and voted on, and our proposals to begin the consideration of the Korean question with our proposal about the troop withdrawal will also be discussed.2. The US proposal, the text of which you have, provides for the formation of a UN commission to observe the elections in Korea and to organize these elections. According to this proposal after the election of a national assembly the latter should form a government, which in turn creates the armed forces of Korea, and only after this are the foreign troops withdrawn.We consider it necessary to object to the American proposals, including the proposal to create a UN commission. With regard to the commission we will declare that its formation is incompatible with the principles of self-determination of the Korean people. In the worst-case scenario, if the majority favors the commission, we will declare that we think it mandatory and necessary to get tentative agreement in advance to the establishment of such a commission by the Koreans of both South and North Korea themselves. Of course, we proceed from the position that the Northerners will reject such a commission.During voting we will vote against the American proposals.If all the same it is decided to form a commission then, in our opinion, we ought not take part in it in view or the above views. When subjecting the American proposals to criticism we will insist on:1) the withdrawal of Soviet and American troops in timeframes according to a directive;2) on holding elections to a national assembly and the formation of a national government of Korea in conditions of the absence of foreign troops;3) on not permitting outside monitoring of the formation of the armed forces of Korea.We understand point 6 of your Nº 267 such that not only the formation of the armed forces of Korea, but also the holding of elections and the formation of a national government should be accomplished in the absence of outside monitoring. This agrees with our proposal, according to which the troop withdrawal is the first task, at a time as according to the US proposal it is shunted to last place.3. In connection with point 2(v) in your Nº 267, when conferring in the delegation we came to the conclusion that when insisting on our demand to discuss the Soviet proposal first we will nevertheless not bring the matter to a vote on this procedural question. The majority in the First Committee considers that only the Korean question is being discussed and that all proposals about this question should be discussed at the same time. It is not to our advantage for [our proposals] on this question to be voted down.During the discussion of the proposals on [their] substance [po sushchestvu]  we will at first seek voting on our proposals. We think that such a plan of action will not contradict your instructions.We will act tomorrow as presented above.4. The question might arise of the number of representatives of the Korean people to be invited. We think that it is important to us to be the same number from North Korea as from South Korea, to which the Americans will probably object. Generally speaking, the number of those invited should not be more (from two to five from each of the two parts of Korea). However, we think that another resolution of the question of the number of those invited should not serve as an obstacle to the invitation of these representatives.Please reply by flash telegram about your decision on points 2, 3, and 4.VYSHINSKY28 October 1947Memo:  Nº 257 (outgoing Nº 21001) of 23 October 1947.

      "On October 29, at midday, the Korean party and government delegation headed by Pak Seong-cheol [Pak Song Chol] left Hanoi. Although in the published declaration the negotiating parties speak about agreement and mutual satisfaction, the Korean delegation has little reason for happiness. Its reception [by the Vietnamese] was perceptibly cold, and only one member of the Politburo [emphasis in the original], Nguyen Duy Trinh, the head of the Vietnamese delegation, saw them off at the airport. At a mass meeting held in the building of the National Assembly on October 25 evening, no Politburo member was present; the speeches were made by the president of the [Supreme] Court as well as the mayor of Hanoi, Comrade Hung, who is not even a CC member. At the mass meeting, [Pak Seong-cheol spoke] about the revolutionary alliance [emphasis in the original] of the Asian peoples, the peoples of Korea, the DRV, China, Laos, and Cambodia [emphasis in the original]. Unlike the Korean speaker, Comrade Hung emphasized the importance of the unity and assistance of all socialist countries, pointing out that the unification of Korea and Vietnam can be achieved [only] by the united assistance of the socialist countries. None of the addresses delivered by the Korean delegation included at least a passing reference to the principles of Marxism-Leninism, proletarian internationalism and the united cooperation of the socialist countries. In contrast, these issues constantly recurred in the Vietnamese speeches. Remarkably, Le Duan [the First Secretary of the Vietnamese Workers’ Party], received the delegation only on the fourth day of its stay in Hanoi, but the next day an illustrated article about his reception of [Soviet cosmonaut Valentina] Tereshkova was published on the first page of the newspapers. At the closing reception, it came to light that they failed to reach an agreement with regard to the text of the joint declaration.   The heads of the diplomatic corps were invited to the farewell address scheduled to be held at the airport at 8.30 a.m., but [the farewell address] took place as late as 11 o’clock, because the debate over the final communiqué had dragged on.

      "A Romanian diplomat said that following his appointment as a presidential adviser, O Jin-u has been playing an increasingly important role within the KWP leadership.In addition, a decision has been made, [at least] in principle, that he should give up his position as chief of the general staff, which will enable him to get involved in the leadership of the party and the government to an even greater extent. Over here, O Jin-u is already being referred to as the second most influential person [after Kim Il Sung]; he did play such a role both at the military aktif [special meeting] and during the visit of Comrade Todor Zhivkov.According to a Romanian evaluation, the following facts have all contributed to the growing role of O Jin-u: Kim Il is gravely ill, the left side of his body has been virtually paralyzed because of rheumatism and other causes (a few days ago, I also saw him as he was being supported by two persons and walking with a stick cane); Kim Yeong-ju is also seriously ill; and Pak Seong-cheol has been assigned to a lower position.411 – T.   \n",

      "On September 3, the heads of the fraternal embassies held a meeting at the Soviet ambassador’s. The Soviet ambassador provided them with information about the visit that the [Soviet] party and government delegation headed by Deputy Foreign Minister [Yakov Aleksandrovich] Malik and [Deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union] Comrade [Kirill Trofimovich] Mazurov had made to the DPRK. Having received Comrade Malik on August 9, Comrade Kim Il Sung received Comrade Mazurov on August 15 (for a brief protocol visit) and also on [August] 18. [...] During the conversations, Kim Il Sung said the following:[...] On the Japanese C[ommunist] P[arty]: they maintain good relations with the Japanese CP, but they also have important differences of opinion. The Japanese CP and the Korean Workers’ Party see the militarization of Japan differently. The leaders of the Japanese CP bring such childish arguments up against the [North Korean claims about the] danger of Japan’s militarization that there is no such danger, nor is it possible, because the constitution prohibits it. The Japanese Socialists pay greater attention to this [issue] than the Communists. This is an opportunist error on the part of the JCP. [...] He repeatedly emphasized that the DPRK was firmly committed to reinforce and develop its contacts with the Soviet Union and the socialist countries, no matter whether the Chinese liked that or not.  We and the Chinese have differences of opinion on several big issues, he said. These are the following:a) In internal politics [emphasis in the original]: issues such as the contradictions among the people, the people’s communes, the Great Leap Forward, the Hundred Flowers [Movement], and the Cultural Revolution (with regard to the last one, he declared that they disagreed with it, and it would not suit Korea). Nevertheless, we regard them as the internal affairs [of China], and we do not interfere in them. b) In foreign politics [emphasis in the original]: The DPRK considers the Soviet Union a friendly country that is constructing communism. The Chinese say that the assistance with which the Soviet Union provides the anti-imperialist forces is a hoax and a swindle. They [the North Koreans] disagree with this. [...]According to the Soviet ambassador, Comrades Malik and Mazurov left the DPRK with an essentially good impression. – 111 –\n",

      "Minutes of Conversation between Comrade Ion Gheorghe Maurer, member of the RCP CC Permanent Presidium Executive Committee, president of the Socialist Republic of Romania Council of Ministers and Comrade Paul Nicolescu Mizil, member of the Permanent Presidium Executive Committee, secretary of the RCP CC, [and] with Comrade Zhou Enlai, Chinese Communist Party CC Politburo Permanent Committee member, People’s Republic of China State Council Premier and Comrade Li Xiannian, People’s Republic of China CC Politburo member, State Council Vice Chairman.– 7 September 1969 –Witnesses to the discussions: Qiao Guanhua, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Yu Zhan, director of the MFA [Ministry of Foreign Affairs] Department for the Soviet Union and Eastern European Countries, Ding Yuahong, Romanian translator, Ion Dorobantu, Chinese translator and Viorica Ivascu, stenographer.The discussions began on 7 September 1969 at 11:45 p.m. and ended on 8 September at 2:20 a.m.Cde. Ion Gheorghe Maurer: First of all, I wanted to send greetings—and I am glad I can do this—to Comrade Mao Zedong, Comrade Lin Biao, to you personally, and to the other comrades, from Comrade Ceausescu and our party and state leaders.Cde. Zhou Enlai: I thank you for these greetings. How is Comrade Ceausescu doing?Maurer: He is in good health.Zhou Enlai: I noted from the photo that he seems very healthy. How is Comrade Bodnaras doing? I heard that he is not doing too well.Maurer: He had a heart attack but he was able to get through it. He is convalescing right now. Zhou Enlai: He did not participate in your congress.Maurer: No, because it took place while his heart attack was announced so he could not participate.Then this sad event occurred in Vietnam, spurring this trip in order to express our condolences. And we thought that on this occasion it would not be a bad idea to make a quick political tour. We haven’t seen each other in a long time, Comrade Zhou Enlai. Many events have taken place in the world since then.Zhou Enlai: We haven’t seen each other in two years.Maurer: But a lot has happened in the world in these past two years and we figured it would not be a bad idea to make a little tour.First, we wish to thank you for participating in the festivities that we had this year at the Congress of the Party celebrating the 25th anniversary of the liberation of our country. The participation of the Chinese state and party proved your strong support during the difficulties we encountered in trying to establish fair rapport between socialist countries. We thank you for this.1Zhou Enlai: I noticed that the telegram I sent you caused the Soviet revisionists to leave the room where the congress was taking place.Maurer: If you would have sent another one… (laughs).Zhou Enlai: We are afraid we could cause you further difficulties. Even though our telegram was written in rather moderate terms, they have put pressure on you.Maurer: The problem now is this: we view your position towards us as one that has been of use to us and that has helped us.Likewise, we also appreciated the fact that things were expressed with great care and we would like you to know that we are grateful for your support and count on it. It is exactly for this reason that we wish to expand relations, obviously, within the limits of mutual interest and possibilities. We have previously talked about this matter. We talked with your comrade ambassador to our country and with the comrade deputy minister of foreign trade.Zhou Enlai: Yes, on the occasion of the visit he made to Romania. Maurer: We showed our interest in further developing relations; this refers to economic relations, exchanges of merchandise, an eventual cooperation in production and in special production. Of course, we have to look at all these in a reasonable and realistic manner.Our political relations are developing. We never tried to hide our desire to develop these relations. On the contrary, we have affirmed our wish to develop these relations as an essential element of our policy.I insisted on making a couple comments concerning our bilateral relations so you could meditate on them and see what we can do to develop these relations multilaterally. Of course, we wished to make this tour in the light of certain recent political developments. It seems to me that Nixon’s visit to Romania has raised much interest and that is why I wish to begin with this.Comrade Ceausescu communicated through your ambassador the content of this visit. I told the ambassador, however, that there are certain aspects that could be better explained during a direct conversation, so this is why I will concentrate on this visit. Of course, since the discussions with Nixon were so long, several things were discussed during the visit. Some of these, such as European security, would probably be of less interest to you; others are of more importance to you.First of all, Nixon expressed without any reservation his wish of finding a way to normalize relations with China. He articulated this very clearly and asked us to help in this matter if we can. I am not sure how we can help (smiling); I told him that what we can do is inform the Chinese leadership about the situation. I told him, however, that it seems to us that there is a series of issues towards which the Chinese leadership has taken a stance and for which you should find solutions, and maybe, by seeking solutions for these problems, will find a way to normalize relations with China. One of these problems is Taiwan (Zhou Enlai laughed).Of course, we didn’t discuss any details such as what has to be done with Taiwan or what doesn’t. It is not our business to discuss such matters. If you will set a date to discuss this, then this discussion will be between you and them, but the man expressed this wish.Our impression was that this wish was sincere, in other words, it corresponds to certain important American interests. We could not figure out what the American interests corresponding to this wish are. We know well that in the opinion of the American public, the wish to normalize relations with China has been present for quite some time. They talked to us about this wish several times. At one point, [Harvard economist John Kenneth] Galbraith conveyed to us Robert Kennedy’s wish, when he was still alive, to come and discuss with us, among others, this problem and see what our opinion is vis-à-vis this situation. The visit never took place due to particular circumstances; later it didn’t take place due to Kennedy’s tragic end.It was during the discussions with Harriman that I became aware of this preoccupation with establishing normal relations with China. I had a pretty long discussion with Harriman.Somebody has already communicated all these things to you, but I want to explain them in this context, because I am under the impression that Nixon—and this is our opinion and the reasoning of the party leadership concerning this issue—that Nixon wants to implement this tendency that is rather markedly present in public opinion and certain leading circles.In relation to this issue, we also discussed the escalation of the Sino-Soviet conflict. Nixon stated firmly that he did not intend to support the Soviet Union in any way if it has any aggressive intention against China.He talked about the Soviet Union’s wish to achieve this Asian security pact. Nixon showed us that the United States would not enter this [pact] in any way and that, in the discussions he had in the countries he visited—India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand—he revealed this position to his varied interlocutors. During these discussions, he clearly showed the United States’ position, which does not wish to enter this system or to support in any way the creation of this Asian security pact.He was very concerned by the possible escalation of the conflict between China and the Soviet Union and noted that in his opinion, if this escalation would tragically lead to a confrontation, this would be the most serious threat to world peace. I understood, according to Nixon’s remarks, that he did not make a secret out of this before the Russians. He didn’t express it directly but he said it in such a way as to make his position known to the Russians.On multiple occasions, Nixon expressed his wish and concern with finding a way to normalize relations with China.Of course, within the framework of these discussions, we deplored the fact that as a result of a series of prior acts, China did not participate in the United Nations, because in the end none of the major international issues could be resolved without China’s participation. Considering this, we deemed as fair his wish to normalize relations with China. This was one of the problems. Of course, we could not discuss any actual means, but estimated that Nixon’s intention of normalizing relations with China was a positive sign.We explained to him: it seems to us that the analysis of the problems between the United States and China sets the tone of this normalization. If these problems are resolved, normalization will ensue and we told him that we will communicate this discussion to the Chinese government.In regards to this matter, Nixon categorized the Vietnam issue as being another element that worsens the international state of affairs and that bores the United States which wishes to liquidate it.He told us that he reached the conclusion that the Vietnam issue could not be solved militarily, that they had concluded that the situation in Vietnam would have to be resolved through political channels and that he was prepared to find a political solution. He said that at the moment the most important thing was not trying to decide whether they made a mistake or not by engaging in Vietnam or if they made a mistake in the way they conducted the Vietnam War, but the problem was how to find a solution.Due to a confluence of favorable conditions—he stated—they reached the Paris talks. However, for a while now, the Paris talks have been idle, so to speak. He said: “We are willing to discuss absolutely any problem from the ten points of the provisional government to the four points of North Vietnam government and the eight points that we, the Americans, proposed, to any other point that could come up, but we want to discuss these to reach a conclusion and move forward. But for a while now we have been coming up against an attitude in Paris and we reached the conclusion—he said—that probably the Vietnamese realized that they have to apply the following strategy: to delay the peace talks and to set in motion a military offensive in South Vietnam hoping that this way the American public opinion, which was against the war, would become increasingly strong and would force the United States to capitulate and withdraw troops under unfavorable conditions.” Nixon continued with the following remarks: “If the Vietnamese reached this conclusion, they are wrong. It is true that a good part of the American public opinion wants the end of the Vietnam War, and I myself want the end of this war—Nixon said—but the Vietnamese are mistaken in thinking that this war will end by having the American public force the president of the United States to capitulate or accept unfavorable conditions.”He said: “I am willing to wait until November, when there will be a year since the beginning of the Paris talks. If the current discussion won’t make any progress by November, the United States will be forced to reassess its position.”Of course, we asked: “And what does this reassessment of your position entail? Does it mean that you will further intensify the war?”He didn’t say yes or no. He only said that the situation will need to be reevaluated.Naturally, we tried to show: but look, they want to propose a solution, to install a provisional government in which all the sides in Vietnam would participate and that, after your withdrawal, they would organize elections. We asked: “Do you think that the election that will take place under the presence of American soldiers in South Vietnam will be free and fair?”To this he replied: “I am willing to withdraw from there, of course, under the condition that North Vietnamese troops will also withdraw. I have nothing against respecting the decision of the Vietnamese people. If the South Vietnamese people say: the government in Saigon has to leave, I am not against it. If they say that they want to unite with North Vietnam, I will not be against it but this decision has to be made freely, under international watch and with all possible guarantees.”I said: “If the government in Saigon remains there, will the election be free?”He said: “Saigon should not organize the elections.”“Then why are you not agreeing with the solution of the provisional coalition government?” we asked.He said: “We cannot agree with this, because this provisional coalition government will not include any of the Saigon government officials, and if I would agree to this it would mean condemning the Saigon government before the Vietnamese people could express their position, and—Nixon said—I cannot agree with this.”So what can we conclude? This is our interpretation: the man is searching for a solution. This is all. The reasons why he is looking for a political solution are pretty clear to us at this time: the war in Vietnam is becoming increasingly unpopular in international public opinion as well as in the American public opinion.The man has all the interest, then, to find a solution. We think that this is why he is looking for a solution. Of course, he is looking for a solution that will be as convenient as possible. But in the end, since he is looking for a political solution, this war, too, will have to end. It is a good thing if it ends as a result of discussions, and in our opinion, a solution could be reached that would respect the fundamental aspirations of the fight of the Vietnamese people. Of course, the discussions won’t be easy and will take place over an entire evening session. But there are some objective conditions—in our opinion—to force the American administration to make concessions over the course of these discussions. In our opinion, this should be tried. Of course, it is not something that will be solved quickly, but it is a matter which, if approached rationally and skillfully, could lead to the mobilization of large popular masses that could push the United States to make these substantial concessions that have to be won by the Vietnamese peoples, either during the discussions or militarily. We believe that promptly solving the Vietnamese issue is very indicated under the current circumstances, Comrade Zhou Enlai. Of course, not any solution will do. Nobody is thinking about this, but this needs to be settled under the condition that it assures that the Vietnamese people will have the possibility of taking control of their own future.Why do we think that under the current circumstances there is an additional reason to wish that the conflict in Vietnam will be solved more quickly? We want this because of an escalation of the conflict between the Soviet Union and China and we are afraid that the existence of this war in Vietnam—I tell you exactly what we think about the situation—could encourage the Soviet Union to do something hasty. It would not be the first time that this would happen. Ultimately, it’s only been a year since the intervention in Czechoslovakia, which, in our opinion, first of all, was the direct result of the fact that they did not think beforehand and did not analyze the situation or the consequences of their actions. In other words, we are very close to a situation which shows us that the Soviet leaders take action, at least sometimes, in very critical instances and circumstances, literally, in a manner other than rational, calm or wise. They are not capable of evaluating the situation realistically or having a sensible vision of the future. That is why we think that this ongoing conflict in Vietnam could be considered by these people as something that invites a hasty act. They’re probably thinking that the Americans are on this side, China supports South Vietnam [NLF], we are coming in the North and doing a little cleansing, a preventive action—or whatever else you could call it. There are a couple other hypotheses but facts show us that very often these people are not able to evaluate situations and particularly their consequences in a rational, judicious manner.This is why we think that this is the moment to find a solution to end the conflict in Vietnam as quickly as possible. It is clear that this solution, to a certain extent, represents an advantage for America. The fact that America ends the war in Vietnam is a good thing for it. The question is, how will it bring it to an end? If it finishes it ensuring that the Vietnamese people will be able to decide their own fate, then this solution is, in our opinion, more advantageous to the Vietnamese and all of us, than to the Americans. We also think that this solution might be reached during the discussions. What is important, though, is to conduct these discussions with enough skill and to take into consideration the fact that what probably constitutes for them—so to speak—the major holdback is [the need] to save the prestige of the United States, so that the United States won’t come out of this completely humiliated. If a solution that will ensure this is found, it is our opinion and conviction that during these discussions, the fundamental objectives of the Vietnamese people can be reached.In any case, we think that this has to be tried. This does not mean that the armed conflict has to end as a result of initiating more involved discussions regarding this matter; this can continue as long as a more acceptable result is reached. What we are not in favor of is the stalemate of the Paris talks.This is what I wanted to express in regards to this matter, which I believe is one of the most important problems.We tried to open discussions with him on the subject of the Near East. He showed relatively very little interest concerning this matter.Zhou Enlai: Why?Maurer: I don’t know.Zhou Enlai: It’s very interesting that he didn’t want to discuss this matter with you.Maurer: The point is that the longest discussion centered on the problems that I just described.Zhou Enlai: Couldn’t the fact that they didn’t want to discuss this issue with you mean that they have already reached an agreement with the Soviets?Maurer: I don’t know if they did or if they didn’t. The only thing he said about the Near East is that if they did not find a way to eliminate this problem, this could become a dangerous matter. But how or what will it be…?More than that, during the official address, we approached the Vietnam issue openly and very publicly, the way we normally do it, including the issue of American troop withdrawal. Comrade Nicolae Ceausescu stated this very clearly in his speech. Nixon very briefly mentioned this issue in his public speech. He didn’t say yes or no. He said that the United States wanted peace, but would respect the commitments it had made. Basically, he avoided any polemic directed at this chapter. He did not want to make any public declaration or to take a public position, and this is how we concluded that the man was looking to facilitate the possibility of an arrangement. These are the issues in Asia, as they resulted from the discussions with Nixon.Of course, other than these, we also discussed issues related to European security and the United Nations…and on this occasion I told him: “How do you think you will be able to solve issues related to the UN, to disarmament and nuclear disarmament and all other problems without China? He admitted that it was impossible to solve the major international issues without China and said that they have to find a way to normalize relations with China. This was the discussion with Nixon and the conclusions that we drew in the light of this discussion.Of course, Nixon’s visit to Romania set off some problems and I would like to inform you of those as part of this discussion.On the occasion of the visit we made to Moscow, at the international conference of communist and workers’ parties, it was decided that Brezhnev and Kosygin would come to Bucharest to sign the Friendship Treaty.Cde. Paul Niculescu Mizil: The Friendship Treaty that has been agreed on for several months now and is ready to replace the one which expired over a year ago.Maurer: We told the Soviets that Nixon would come here [to Romania].Niculescu Mizil: They sent an official letter signed by Brezhnev and Kosygin to the Romanian side, informing us that they would come here on 15-16 July and asking for our consent. We consented immediately and the visit was arranged.Maurer: And when Nixon’s visit took place we made it known to them. Later, we received another letter also signed by Brezhnev and Kosygin, in which they stated that they regretted that they could not make it on July 15-16 due to unforeseen circumstances that would prevent them from coming.Niculescu Mizil: The extent of their concern is what they didn’t foresee…(laughs)Maurer: Yes, this concern does not allow leaders at their level to come here. They said that they regret this since the treaty, which has particular importance, was going to be signed during this visit, but that they plan on doing this in the fall.Niculescu Mizil: They proposed to sign the treaty in the fall.Maurer: At a date that would be later established though common accord.Zhou Enlai: Yes, unforeseen events…On the occasion of President Ho Chi Minh’s death, Kosygin cancelled the reception of the Japanese Minister of Foreign Affairs, but later changed his mind and received him; this means that he granted more importance to Japan than to you. They do not keep their word to a socialist country.When they found out about the death of President Ho Chi Minh, they decided to leave immediately for Hanoi. But, afterwards, when they heard that we were in Hanoi and that the funeral was taking place later, they postponed their departure. After finding out that we had returned, they rushed again to leave for Vietnam.The Japanese Minister of Foreign Affairs was received as soon as he arrived in Moscow. We can see what attitude they have towards the Minister of Foreign Affairs of a militant country like Japan, to which they grant so much attention. In their heads the only countries that exist are the United States, the Federal Republic of Germany, Japan and then England and France. Those are their greatest friends.This is the main problem.Maurer: In any case, what we are concerned with is that during this whole affair our independence and sovereignty are respected.Zhou Enlai: In our bilateral relations, we respect these principles and this is a condition that favors our friendship.I have told you before and I want to tell you again, I also told the same thing to our Vietnamese comrades, that our guiding principle is not interfering in Vietnam’s domestic affairs or asking them to continue the war or start negotiations. We will support them when they will ask us, when they need our support, according to our capabilities. I told the same thing to the current Vietnamese leadership.Ho Chi Minh was a close friend of ours during periods of conflict; there were strong class feelings between us. However, the Vietnamese Party and state have solved and continue to be able to solve their problems independently.Comrade Ho Chi Minh has participated at the revolutionary movement in China in 1920-1930-1940. President Ho Chi Minh’s passing represents a loss not only for the Vietnamese nation, but also for the Chinese and nations around the world.As you are aware, I wasn’t able to leave the country for three years because of daily preoccupations. Yet these strong ties between our parties and the Chinese and Vietnamese nations determined me to leave the country for one day to go to Vietnam. Li Xiannian will lead the delegation that will participate at the funeral. Not attending the funeral would be a sign of disrespect on our part. I wasn’t able to stay there more than a day; even though I was there during the first day, I was late. When I arrived the body was being embalmed.When they found out that I was back in Beijing, the Soviets were relieved. They cannot understand these ties between us. There is not only a difference in our position but also in our feelings. This means that we are not going in the same direction.What do you think of Soviet policy? They exercised so much pressure against Czechoslovakia! Likewise, they are putting great pressure on you and East Germany, while they allowed elections in West Berlin, which means selling out West Berlin. Currently, a large number of troops are concentrated to the north of China. They are trying to do too many things at once. Just as the Americans, they are involved in too many issues; they are active in the Mediterranean, the Indian Ocean, not to speak of the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic, and they have even been in the Caribbean for a while. Maurer: This is true, and we too are thinking of all these things, Comrade Zhou Enlai.Zhou Enlai: What results from these facts is that all current Soviet leaders are the same, and they are all crazy.Maurer: We are thinking the same thing, Comrade Zhou Enlai. But there is one difference. We are smaller than China, much smaller actually, and the care with which we are looking at all these things is much greater than theirs.I want to tell you that there are many things that are very hard to explain or the explanations are very sad. But we have to take in account that the Soviet Union is right next to us. The only thing dividing us is a river not even 40 meters wide. The Soviet Union has great military capabilities. The crazier its leaders are, the more dangerous it becomes. Of course, we are by no means trying to cause a conflict. We are trying to find some common ground with the Soviet Union, not just in any way, but based on a set of principles. If the Soviet Union tries to do in Romania what it did in Czechoslovakia we will fight back. Of course, we don’t have the pretension to crush the Soviet army, to reach Moscow and dictate peace in the Kremlin…Zhou Enlai: You can’t have these pretensions.Maurer: …We cannot do this, but we will fight in Romania the same way that the Vietnamese are.Zhou Enlai: Just like you, we don’t have these intentions either, even though they say that we are some sort of successors of Genghis Khan. We tend to ignore this calumny and we can tell you that we don’t have these intentions either.Maurer: Now, the truth is that we are worried about the deterioration of relations between China and the Soviet Union and I can tell you why: because this can cause the Soviet Union to do something stupid in China, but it can just as well do something stupid in Europe just to be able to say: my hands are free, I can do whatever I want to do there.This situation does not only worry us but many others, too. I believe that many countries are worried about this situation; their preoccupation revolves around finding a solution to help avoid the conflict between these two great powers. Not to mention how this would affect socialism. It would be the war that started between two very powerful socialist countries and that could end up endangering international peace. We are taking this very seriously, Comrade Zhou Enlai, very seriously. The Soviet Union has put a lot of pressure on us, you know this well, to take the Soviet Union’s side, to embrace its points of view, to be able to say: China leads a policy of aggression. It hasn’t been easy but we thought we had to do this, it is mandatory to do this.Zhou Enlai: Yes, we know this, and both the party and our nation appreciate your position because this is a fair position. It is not easy for you. Maurer: We thought that for us, the only fair position is our main position. Niculescu Mizil: And we clearly specified in the discussions between comrades Ceausescu and Brezhnev that we would never be the ones advising the Soviet Union to fight China, or the Chinese to fight the Soviets. In our opinion, the position that corresponds to the Soviet Union’s interests—because we were discussing this with them—and international peace and socialism is trying not to intensify the conflict.Maurer: Declarations of this nature have not been received calmly, Comrade Zhou Enlai. This is clear. But we thought that it is good to do this and I think that one of the things we accomplished at the Moscow talks, that took place the way it did, is that there was a fairly large number of communist parties that stood up against condemning China. It is not a secret for anyone that one of the objectives of this conference was to denounce China. When? After we agreed that there would be no denunciations at the conference. The Paraguayan was the first to stand up.Niculescu Mizil: The Paraguayan…this was the form.Maurer: Yes, the form. Exactly.Niculescu Mizil: Comrade Ceausescu had a discussion with Brezhnev before the conference.Maurer: Comrade Ceausescu stood up and said: “This is something that we will not accept,” and he wasn’t alone. In my opinion it was a significant occurrence, maybe one of the most notable of the entire conference as certain things were prevented that could not previously be stopped. Comrade Ceausescu and Comrade Mizil, who talked for a long time with an entire group of parties, detected the preoccupation of an important number of parties with finding ways to improve relations with the Chinese Communist Party. The Italians expressed this wish together with the Spaniards and others.Niculescu Mizil: This is where the following happens: certain actions undertaken by the Soviet Union, especially the intervention in Czechoslovakia, had a good side too—if we can put it this way—in the sense that they woke up a number of communist parties. An extremely important aspect, Comrade Zhou Enlai, was what I had the possibility to discover during the contact we made with various parties. This relates not only to the problems in Czechoslovakia, because there are parties that, after the invasion of Czechoslovakia, are examining their position [in the communist world] in more general terms. You see, we are giving much importance to the fact that in Moscow, a significant number of parties presented their own point of view and they clearly affirmed a party’s right to independence, a fact that led to the [Soviet] failure to achieve the initial goals of the conference. The initial plan was to bring together a large number of parties that could all raise their hand in approval of the same idea, with the same discipline—so to speak—in front of which there could be only one leader. And this is not what happened since an important number of parties clearly exposed their own positions.I have to tell you that according to the contacts I made with numerous other parties, many of the comrades in the leadership of these parties and central committees are reexamining the way they have perceived the Chinese problem until now. It is also an important aspect of the international communist scene.There are parties, as I have informed you about some of these at the time, serious parties, which consider that it would be good to find a possibility to contact you, to hold discussions and meetings with the Chinese Communist Party and that affirm in official documents their wish to reexamine their former positions vis-à-vis the Chinese Communist Party. I am referring to the Spanish Communist Party, the Italian Communist Party and the Indian Marxist Communist Party with which I had a few meetings and which came to our Congress. I am referring to parties that are not necessarily big, but that hold a certain position, such as: the Communist Party from Reunion, a series of European communist parties, the English Communist Party, the one in Switzerland and the ones in the Nordic countries. We decided to develop contacts with these parties. I can honestly tell you, since our relations are based on complete sincerity, that the Chinese Communist Party could offer support in this process of building new relations within the workers’ movement, against the infringement of principles of norms dictating relations, such as the intervention in Czechoslovakia.Maurer: The affirmation of the so-called Brezhnev Doctrine.Niculescu Mizil: Limited sovereignty. These are some interesting reactions and we think that, as far as we are concerned, we should closely follow and stimulate them.Regarding the same matter, I wish to tell you that during the contacts I made I had the opportunity to notice that many communist parties are concerned with the conflict at the Sino-Soviet border. There is a great effort to present China in a negative light. This is why, during the discussions we had with these parties, we clearly showed our position to the effect that we would not take the position that our Soviet comrades were trying to dictate [their views] and that our attitude centered on the effort to do everything possible to avoid a potential intensification of the conflict and to try to solve it by political means. I want to underline that changes are occurring in Latin America, in the Dominican Communist Party, the Mexican Communist Party—we have good relations with both. There are some interesting positions even within the Communist Party of Venezuela, even though there are still some possibilities to maneuver things there. And there is a progression of tendencies and new aspects in the workers’ movement that are worthy to mention and sustain.Finally, with regard to the question that you posed, Comrade Maurer responded but I want to add one thing: our position is very clear. We will militate for the development of relations with all socialist countries. We will not do anything to worsen these relations, but we will firmly base these relations on the principles that we believe in and that we have already affirmed. And, to publicly state these principles, independence, the right of every nation, of every party to decide in its own country; you realize that, given our situation, it is not easy, but very difficult. I am telling you this for two reasons.First of all, to show you that we are aware of the difficulties that we face; [but] we believe [in] stating these principles—and this is clear not only for a group of people, for Ceausescu, Maurer, for a few others, it is clear for the entire Central Committee, for the entire party, it is clear for the entire nation. The congress that we just organized, we organized it in this spirit, to clearly portray our position and that of the entire nation regarding this problem.The second reason that comrade Maurer pointed out is the fact that we consider the development of relations between Romania and China to be extremely important in this context. In other words, we believe that the development of economic, political and military relations between China and Romania is not just another issue, or just another set of bilateral relations between two countries, but a matter that at the same time represents an important element in the promotion of the principles of independence, sovereignty, equality of rights and that helps Romania to promote these principles.Maurer: All these show in our opinion, Comrade Zhou Enlai, that there are developments in the international communist and workers’ movement, and in our opinion, it would be wise for the Chinese Communist Party to see if it could do something about these things. This is one of our concerns that we have emphasized. We believe that an intervention by the Chinese Communist Party within the framework of this debate on principles that is shaking up an entire group of parties could help clarify it, and this is why we believed it proper to raise these issues with you. Of course, there are many problems in this world, but if we are going to discuss all of them, we would never get to sleep. But these are some of the issues that we wanted to bring to your attention. Maybe we will see each other upon your return, if you have anything to communicate to us. Zhou Enlai: Will you stay here another night?Cde. Gheorghe Maurer: But why not?Niculescu Mizil: We can spend the day here, too, not only the night.Cde. Gheorghe Maurer: Why not? If we’ve come all the way here and we made this trip, we can at least sit down and talk. It’s clear.Zhou Enlai: Your stop in Beijing is interpreted as a very unpleasant event by many people in Moscow.Cde. Gheorghe Maurer: This is true.Zhou Enlai: Considering the fact that you are the only ones stopping in Beijing. The Korean comrades have also stopped here. The others traveled through Afghanistan, Pakistan. Cde. Gheorghe Maurer: This is exactly why we wanted to go through Beijing and why we wish to stay here another day.Zhou Enlai: The Korean comrades will also stay.Niculescu Mizil: I said: we first of all prefer this road because we know it and we prefer to take the roads we are familiar with rather than the ones unknown to us. Secondly, I heard that several delegations took the same flight.Maurer: All, except the Soviet delegation.Niculescu Mizil: We preferred to take our own plane.Zhou Enlai: And the Koreans came on their own plane, too. Albania, being a smaller country, could not send its delegation on its own plane but had to travel on a foreign plane. We understand very well that you are in a difficult situation. Is it inevitable to have these Warsaw Pact maneuvers on your territory?Maurer: Now I want to tell you one thing, so that we can be very clear. We had certain agreements—regarding the clarification of the Warsaw Pact problems—which were very rigid and gave the Soviets the right to do almost everything until the end. We asked that these agreements be abandoned and that a new agreement be signed that would ensure the rights of every state participating in the Warsaw Pact, [as well as] the [Military] Command. The discussions took approximately two years. They were very heated, but in the end we imposed our point of view that no troops can be deployed from one state or on the territory of a state without the consent of that state. Of course, this new agreement establishes joint exercises, in other words, the Command is responsible for organizing the preparation for battle of the armies participant in the Warsaw Pact. During this preparation, the armies do various exercises. We agreed on an exercise on our territory right before the invasion of Czechoslovakia, in which other states were meant to participate. Before the invasion of Czechoslovakia, we decided to postpone the exercise until the fall of this year. Now they came and said: “it’s time, let’s do the exercise.” Our Chief of the General Staff is in Moscow right now. He has instructions to show clearly that we cannot hold any military exercises this year because we had a series of [other military] activities [serie de actiuni], so military exercises are out of the question. He also has instructions to sustain the idea of staff exercises, only the commanders, on the map, without troops.Niculescu Mizil: In any case, we told them that during the fall of this year we simply cannot do any exercises.Maurer: And we wish to only have general staff exercises even in the upcoming years. However, we think that until the very end we will push these exercises further and further. In any case, this is the position we are taking. It is clear that they cannot impose these exercises on us. It is true that the operating rules of the Command give it the right to organize exercises, but they do have a say in the way the exercises are done and in all these other aspects. Or, we are determined to push further the military exercises involving troops on our territory.Cde. Zhou Enlai: I wish to thank you for this report at such a late hour. Even though there might be differences in our points of view, such a direct exchange of ideas between our countries is necessary. As you said earlier, when you will return here, we will talk more about a series of issues. Now I briefly want to deal with certain issues.First of all, regarding the Vietnamese issue. I can tell you clearly: whether the resistance movement against the Americans continues or whether the Paris talks continue, it all depends on the Vietnamese. We exchanged opinions on a couple topics with them, especially on the topic of South Vietnam and the resistance fight against the Americans. This exchange of ideas referred to the way we are going to support them and what we can learn from this. In regards to the way this war will continue, what proportion it will have, greater or smaller, these are their problems. Considering that our countries are neighbors and that our nations are connected by a long, revolutionary friendship, it is natural for us to help them. Vietnam is a neighboring country and I told them that China represents the back of their front. The nation of South Vietnam, of only 14 million inhabitants, operating on a limited surface of only 170,000 km squared, has been able and continues to resist an army of over 1,100,000 soldiers, including 500,000 Americans. It is amazing that such a small country has been able to put up resistance against such a big army for over five years. Because of this, there is nothing else we can do other than offer our financial and moral support. Considering that this is their war, our help can only be indirect. The situation is different in the Korean War where we directly participated with troops.We believe that the Vietnamese people thus contribute to the cause of the proletarian internationalism, to the fight of nations across the world against imperialism. We talked about this several times in the past. This idea deserves to be emphasized by all of us, especially the Chinese nation. The Vietnamese people deserve our respect.Regarding the Paris talks, we have never intervened in this matter. We don’t have to intervene. We did not intervene and we do not want to intervene; not only that, but we are not interested in the way these talks are unfolding, if they are stalling or not. We know a few things about these negotiations from the reports that our Vietnamese comrades present us.In connection with this issue, I wish to make one proposition: it is necessary for you to make known the position of the Americans concerning the Vietnamese problem, considering that you have discussed this with the Americans and that you would not be peaceful if you did not. But when looking at the way the talks are unfolding, I think it is better that none of us interferes. Maurer: But we can’t even do it, we don’t know.Zhou Enlai: Maybe the Soviets are interested to have the treaties go faster in some situations and slower in others.Matters like the West Berlin, the Middle East, and the Vietnamese and Czechoslovak issues are viewed by the Soviets as advantages in their negotiations with the Americans. It is likely that a number of well intentioned parties hope that the Americans will withdraw their troops from Vietnam and stop this war of aggression, but the Soviets do not look at things in this way. All their problems are subordinated to their external affairs, and their external policies are based on their alliance with the Americans, and this way these two big countries will determine the world’s fate. They are building a friendship with the Americans but are at the same time clashing with them. This is why today’s world is full of contradictions. In the context of these contradictions, your situation is more difficult than ours. We understand this. It is extraordinary how by promoting an independent foreign policy, you are not following the Soviets in their anti-Chinese acts and do not consider China as an aggressor country. We thank you for that.If the war in Vietnam will end as a result of negotiations with unfavorable results for the Vietnamese people, the Soviets will be responsible for this, not us or you. If you would intervene in this matter, they would blame it on you. They would say that the Romanian comrades intervened in this matter and spoiled everything. You can express these good intentions, but without getting involved. We clearly told the Vietnamese comrades, as Comrade Mao Zedong clearly told Comrade Ho Chi Minh, that the way this war will be conducted—fight or negotiations—will be decided by the Vietnamese. We also told them that if they will need our help in continuing this war, we will offer them this help, according to our possibilities.Regarding the relations between China and the United States, you know that there are direct contracts between us and the Americans. You said it that, as a matter of fact, it is about China’s place at the UN and Taiwan. We are discussing these problems with the Americans for the past 14 years. In any case, they know our position very well, and we know theirs. You put it very well that one day, sooner or later, these problems will be solved. Kennedy could not solve them. If Nixon won’t solve them, there will be a Kennedy II and a Nixon II. In any case, we do not owe them anything, they owe us; they took over Taiwan and have to recognize the fact that Taiwan is ours. In regard to our relations with the Soviet Union, I can tell you concisely that the border incidents that took place in the past months have been deliberately provoked by the Soviets. Their goal is to divert the population’s attention from domestic problems.Our first principle is not to provoke and the second is to resolve issues through equitable treaties. You know that we sent a delegation to Khabarovsk. In the beginning, they did not want to reach an agreement in not even one of the technical issues. However, we did reach an agreement in the end. They didn’t foresee this so they proceeded to a number of calumnies. Our attitude is based on not refusing negotiations, better said, on looking for equitable negotiations. We expressed this position in our declaration: until the issues are resolved the status quo shall be maintained and incidents shall be avoided. This is our position. During the last incident, which took place in Xinjiang, they took two prisoners and killed 22 of our people. They don’t want to free the prisoners, not even the two in Xinjiang or another who was taken prisoner in the eastern sector of the border. On the subject of the Soviet propaganda [claiming] that we would start a nuclear war, not even the Western press believes it. You understand that the only reason why we are trying to develop nuclear weapons is so we could destroy their own nuclear monopoly. Every time we tested nuclear weapons we published communiques stating that we will not be the first to use these weapons and that we seek the convocation of a conference bringing all countries together in order to ban these weapons altogether. Now they are making propaganda that they will bomb China’s nuclear bases. But doesn’t this mean war? Doesn’t this mean an undeclared war? This will be war, it is an aggression, it can’t be something else. They can say that the Americans are the first to have started bombing and now they can do the same.In February 1965, this Mr. Kosygin stopped in Beijing on his way to Hanoi. His visit coincided with the beginning of the bombardments. At that time, Kosygin did not have any objections towards this. If the Soviets will take the same stand towards China as the Americans did towards Vietnam, we will not stand quiet, we will not allow this. Vietnam has its own situation. They wanted to separate the war in South Vietnam from the bombardments in North Vietnam. They wanted to separate the two areas of Vietnam. You were in that country and are aware of this. China’s situation is, however, different. China is a united country. In spite of this, there might be a number of crazy leaders who are considering taking action against our country. Maybe this is why Brezhnev said that it is time to create a collective security system in Asia. But we can discuss about this later, when you will return. Vietnam needs our help. Let’s stop here and continue when you will come back.Cde. Ion Gheoghe Maurer: This is what we will do. We will stop by upon our return and we will try to continue our discussions about the most relevant topics and if you are interested we will also update you on other issues. Maybe you have specific questions.One last thing, Comrade Zhou Enlai. Maybe we would not have anything against sending a press announcement stating that we have met and discussed. If it doesn’t bother you, we could do this. Zhou Enlai: It doesn’t bother us.Niculescu Mizil: It is better, so nobody will say that we had a secret meeting.Zhou Enlai: You stayed in Beijing, we saw each other…Maurer: Yes, that we stayed in Beijing and had a friendly conversation.Zhou Enlai: Go ahead.1. Editor’s Note: The Chinese did not participate, but sent a message to the RCP Congress. Soviet delegate Konstantin F. Katushev walked out of the Congress and returned only after the message had been read.\n",

      "Record of Chairman Mao’s conversation with a Soviet Communist Party Committee Delegation(Not yet proof read)Time: September 18, 1956, 18:00 – 21:10Location: Zhongnanhai, Yi Nian HallParticipants: Soviet side: [Anastas] Mikoyan, [Nuritdin] Mukhitdinov, Boris Ponomarev, [Ivan] Kapitonov, [Pavel] Yudin, Sachkov [Saqiukefu]Chinese side: Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Peng Dehuai, Deng Xiaoping, Wang Jiaxiang, Shi Zhe(At the beginning of the conversation, Chairman Mao asked Mikoyan and others if they feel tired having a meeting right after their arrival. Mikoyan said he was fine. Thereupon he introduced each member of the CC CPSU delegation to the Chinese comrades.)Chairman Mao (hereafter, Chairman): As you see, what should be done about the Korea problem?Mikoyan: All right! Let us start the discussion with this bad problem!Chairman: Have you studied this problem? Have you seen it?Mikoyan: We have not studied it properly yet. When Kim Il Sung visited every fraternal country in Europe, he did stop by Moscow. When he came, Khrushchev and other comrades from Central Committee met with Kim Il Sung. We raised the Korea problem and mentioned our views to Kim Il Sung. His return trip through Moscow coincided with my vacation, so I did not meet him then.  However, as far as I know, comrades from the CC CPSU spoke to him again. There were some questions that weren’t clear, and at that time we entrusted [the question] to the CC CPSU Department for Liaison [with Communist and Workers’ Parties] for it to slowly work it out afterwards.Ponomarev: At the time Kim Il Sung expressed agreement with our views and acceptance of our criticism. Kim Il Sung said that he would henceforth consider our opinions in his work and pay attention to rectifying his mistakes. During the meeting everyone spoke very candidly. We reported the results of the conversation to the CC CPSU. Later the CC CPSU sent a special notice to the CC CCP concerning this question. The CC CCP already sent a response. Chairman: Indeed, I do remember there was a notice. I think you spoke well, you did the right thing. Mikoyan: Although Kim Il Sung expressed agreement with our opinion, after returning home he continued to conduct affairs as he deemed fit. We received very little official material concerning their recent plenum. Kim Il Sung only told the Soviet ambassador in [North] Korea that there was debate during the meeting, that the discussion was good, and that now the situation is clear, there are no longer any problems. However according to the unofficial information that we received, the situation inside the Korean party is still very bad. We also heard some of some of the circumstances of which you know. Chairman: By now already four people have fled to China. Two of them are members of the Central Committee, one is a candidate member of the Central Committee, and one is a member of the Pyongyang Party Committee. During the August 30, [1956] CC Plenum they raised views of Kim Il Sung , so they were expelled from the party. They knew they were about to be arrested, and so they fled. While in Pyongyang, they did not have enough time to inform our ambassador.Mikoyan: We did not know that they would be arrested but we believe that this is entirely possible. The [North] Korean ambassador in the Soviet Union comrade Ri Sang-jo is a good comrade. Not long ago he asked to speak to CC CPSU comrades regarding the internal situation in the Korean party. We later asked comrade Ponomarev to talk with him. Ri Sang-jo said that Kim Il Sung cabled to recall him. He [Ri Sang-jo] said that he knew that if he returned then he would certainly be arrested. He does not want to return to [North] Korea. The head of [North] Korean Post and Telecommunications [Ministry] is currently in the Soviet Union for medical treatment. Recently he heard that Kim Il Sung wanted him to return. He also does not dare to return and said that if he does return then he will surely be arrested. Whether or not these things will actually happen, we do not know. But we know that these two comrades are good people. They said that they do not care whether or not they will be arrested, they only want that the question is handled correctly, that it is beneficial for the [North] Korean Party. Yesterday we invited some comrades from the [North] Korean supply delegation for a conversation. I said: we asked you to talk with us because we want to understand some circumstances. I openly told them that the four comrades who have fled to China have letters for the CC CCP and the CC CPSU, describing the current internal situation in the Korean party. Judging by the conversation, the [North] Korean delegates are parroting a few lines which had been taught to them by others. They said that those are all bastards. I asked them: what about history of these people’s struggle - when were they elected to the Central Committee? They said that these people have more than ten years of membership in the party, and that they were elected to the Central Committee a few years ago. But they also said that these people are anti-party and anti-government. I asked them: where is the evidence? They said that these people engaged in an anti-party letter during the Party Central Committee Plenum. I said that criticism of the party’s work and the party’s leaders during a party meeting cannot be considered anti-party rhetoric. If a Central Committee member cannot criticize the party’s work during a party plenum, then where can he speak! The party meeting is the only place where speaking out is allowed. As for the question of the internal situation in the Korean party, I spoke about it at the CC CPSU prior to coming to Beijing. However because there isn’t much material, no one has definite opinions. However, everyone thinks something is not right. We believe that the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union should have influence on the Korean party and on Kim Il Sung. While he was in Moscow, we already spoke to him in a sincere way. It is still not very clear to us whether Kim Il Sung himself is bad or the people around him are bad. In the past Kim Il Sung gave us the impression of a capable party member with certain organizational abilities. However, when looking at a person one cannot only depend on what he says, one must also look at his practical actions. Therefore Kim Il Sung is difficult to understand. There is a serious crisis within the Korean party. If it goes on like this, the party will collapse.Chairman: Indeed, this is dangerous!Mikoyan: We feel uneasy about this affair, and we suffer from the lack of sufficient material. Therefore, at the moment it is still difficult for us to make up our minds. Therefore, during the conversation at the Central Committee we decided to come to Beijing and exchange views with the Chinese party comrades about this issue, and then again talk with Kim Il Sung. Our original calculation was that Kim Il Sung would come to attend the 8th Congress [of the Chinese Communist Party]. We would very much like to know what views the Chinese comrades have about this issue. Chairman: Kim Il Sung is not coming! He said he is sick.Mikoyan: I heard that he is currently in Pyongyang, but our embassy also has information which says he is resting in a villa on the bank of the Yalu River. We have an idea: we will pick a few comrades from our delegation and the Chinese party can also send a few comrades. Together we will travel to Pyongyang. We will jointly suggest that the Korean party should hold a Politburo meeting and invite Kim Il Sung to attend. All three sides will then have a talk together and clear up the situation. In my view, talking with the Korean delegates who are currently in Beijing is useless. We should still go to Pyongyang and listen to the opinion of both sides. Listening to just the opinions of the fugitives is not good. Kim Il Sung will then say we do not listen to his opinion. If we do not go to Pyongyang and instead invite him to come to Beijing, he will say that he is sick and can’t come. As a result, there will be no talks. Even if he himself comes while others do not come, this would still not be good for the talks. During talks with the Korean delegation yesterday, they said they will report to their CC on our conversation with them. They also said that they are willing to write up some material for the CC CPSU and the CC CCP so that we have some reference material when considering the Korean issue. I told Choe Yong-geon that evidently there is now some dispute in your party. I asked him: what attitude to you have towards people who oppose you? Choe Yong-geon said that they will use the method of re-education.Chairman: How can this even be done? People have already been expelled from the Party!Mikoyan: They said that there are still some people who have not been expelled yet.Chairman: I heard that they recently dismissed two vice-premiers merely because they voiced some different views. Among the four people who escaped to China two are Central Committee members, and one is a candidate member of the Central Committee. They were expelled simply because they made some criticism during a CC meeting.  Mikoyan: I heard that during the CC Plenum, they did not even allow these people to finish speaking. This kind of situation is not be allowed [even] during branch [party] meetings.Chairman: Indeed! This is not normal for party life. As far as we know, during recent years many people were arrested in [North] Korea. For example, the high level cadre comrade Pak Il-u of the people’s army was arrested for no reason. Peng Dehuai (hereafter, Peng): Comrade Pak Il-u joined the communist youth league in China in 1928. In 1929 he transferred to the party, and then in 1931 in Manchuria he joined the Anti-Japanese United Army; he is a very good comrade.Mikoyan: What shall we do about these issues?Chairman: During the war, there were also many responsible [military] officers who were fired.Mikoyan: As far as we know, a chief of the political department and a chief of the logistics department were also fired.Peng: The head of the Sixth Army Bang Ho-san originally returned from China. There were four divisions in all that returned to [North] Korea, he headed one of the divisions. When he withdrew to the North, he brought back six thousand men. Afterwards, he was the head of the military academy. Once, when discussing the Korean War issue, he said that the timing was not right for war. As a result, he was later dismissed.Mikoyan: This is not an issue of timing, it is an issue of whether or not it should have been undertaken in the first place. The initial decision was wrong. If you want to do it, do it right, attain victory. What should we do in the end, after all this discussion?Chairman: I am afraid what you are saying is still the best. We still have to convince them to unite, convince them to retract [previous] orders, restore these people’s party membership, restore these people to their positions. As for the people who are afraid to return home, they should be allowed to return without arrest. Otherwise, it would be inconvenient for our two countries. Both of our countries are harboring criminals, you have harbored two and we have harbored four. (Laughter).Mikoyan: The Korean party has not yet asked us for those people, but they have already asked you for them. You not sending them back is correct. If they were sent back, I am afraid they will be arrested. Chairman: If they were sent back, they would be killed. I think Pak Heon-yeong could have been saved from death. In November 1953 we had a conversation with Kim Il Sung in this very room. He said there is evidence of Pak Heon-yeong’s treason, but it is not sufficient. He asked me what to do. I once told Kim Il Sung that this kind of people should not be killed no matter what. By not killing them you can retain the initiative. If in the future it is proven that he is not a counter-revolutionary, you can say: I did not kill him. You can even restore his name and honor. If in the future it is proven that he is indeed a counter-revolutionary then you may still lock him up and still not kill him. Doing it this way will not have any negative aspects. At the time I said that this affair should be [carefully] considered; Pak Heon-yeong is the southern party’s leader, if you kill him now then the masses will not know what crime he committed in the end. Pak Heon-yeong is not like [Lavrentii] Beria; Beria killed many people, whereas Pak Heon-yeong is a scholar. Mikoyan: Indeed, Pak Heon-yeong is an intellectual and he has never threatened anyone. Pak Heon-yeong was one of the founders of the Korean party; he was a figure during the Comintern years. We met him many times in Moscow. At the time our impression of him was that he was a well-educated person; we had a good impression of him. Prior to the execution of Pak Heon-yeong, our KGB advisor in Korea reported on this affair to the KGB. The KGB also reported on this affair to the CC. The CC instructed the KGB to suggest to the Korean party through advisers not to kill Pak Heon-yeong. However in the end, they still killed him. Our mistake at the time was that we did not let the Korean party CC know that this opinion the official view of [the Soviet] CC. We only mentioned the suggestion through advisors. As you know, the suggestions of advisors can be listened to or rejected. Zhou Enlai (hereafter, Zhou): Unlikely. The last time we spoke with Kim Il Sung here, we expressed the official view of the CC CCP. But they also did not heed us. Mikoyan: After our KGB advisor reported that [North] Korea wants to kill Pak Heon-yeong, for a few months we did not hear any news regarding the execution. We thought that the issue has been delayed, and maybe [Pak Heon-yeong] would not be killed; therefore we did not consider using the name of our party CC to actively advise them [not to kill him]. Instead we only channeled our opinion in the form of a suggestion through our advisor. In the end, they still killed him. Chairman: It seems now they are greatly dissatisfied with people from the central committees of our two parties. There is a lot of suspicion.Mikoyan: What do you mean by “they”?Chairman: The Korean party CC. The people who criticized Kim Il Sung only dared to criticize him at a meeting of the Central Committee because they heard Kim Il Sung was criticized in Moscow. But who would have thought that they would be expelled from the party during a CC meeting. Mikoyan: Your view is correct. The Party secretary of our Embassy in [North] Korea (his external title is Counselor) said that recently some Korean comrades came over to talk with him and reflected on the internal situation of the Korean party. Our counselor listened attentively to their account but did not say much. Afterwards, Kim Il Sung found out about this matter. Kim Il Sung therefore became suspicious that the Soviet Embassy representing, the CC CPSU, is persuading people who oppose him to attack him. Chairman: The 20th Soviet Party Congress was very unfavorable to Kim Il Sung. The 20th Party Congress revealed Stalin’s mistakes, and Kim Il Sung is still doing the Stalin thing. He brooks no word of opposition. He kills whoever opposes him. Mikoyan: Indeed, Kim Il Sung is doing the Stalin thing. Chairman: The Central Committee plenum that he held this time after returning to [North Korea] was merely a formality. It was merely an attempt to show that all is well with their work. Mikoyan: According to the CC CPSU delegation that participated in the 3rd Korean Worker’s Party Congress, the delegates at the 3rd Party Congress were all appointed by the Worker’s Party CC. They were not actually elected. The Congress said that the cult of personality is a Soviet phenomenon. It has nothing to do with [North] Korea. If one were to say that there was a cult of personality in [North] Korea, then it was only present with Pak Heon-yeong; and now Pak Heon-yeong is no longer among the living.Chairman: Indeed, I have read the notice from the CC CPSU regarding the situation in the Korean party. You already criticized them and said that their 3rd Party Congress was done poorly. Mikoyan: The Soviet comrades believe that their 3rd Party Congress was not an official Party Congress. The meeting was only for the show. The meeting was done poorly. Chairman: As I see it, the recent party plenum was also only for show. [They] wanted to get by after making just minor self-criticism. They did not think that so many people would want the CC to make a good self-criticism. Mikoyan: Actually the shortcomings were not mentioned at all. Sometimes bureaucrats conveniently disguise themselves by conducting some “self-criticism”; this is all to gloss over [their shortcomings]. It seems Kim Il Sung did not receive a very good education within the party. Chairman: I approve of the solution you have just mentioned. What should we do and where? Suggest that they hold a politburo meeting, that’s good.Mikoyan: We will go [to North Korea] together with the Chinese comrades.Chairman: In this regard, comrade Peng Dehuai can go, he is familiar with the affairs there. How about this: you send three people, we will send one.Mikoyan: It is not good if you send one and we send three. You should also send three!(Chairman Mao, Liu Shaoqi, and Zhou Enlai discussed for a while and decided that the CCP side would be sending a four-person delegation consisting of Peng Dehuai, Nie Rongzhen, Li Kenong, and Qiao Wanguang. They then suggested that the Soviet ambassador to [North] Korea should also join the CC CPSU delegation. Mikoyan accepted Chairman Mao’s suggestion, that is to have the Soviet ambassador to [North] Korea also join the CC CPSU delegation.)Mikoyan: I suggest that tonight we greet Pyongyang over the phone, and then we can fly early tomorrow. If there is no confidential [telephone] line, then we can also not disclose the specific names of the individuals [traveling to North Korea]. We can just say that there will be two delegations; and that we suggest holding a meeting to discuss related issues.Chairman: What if Kim Il Sung is not in Pyongyang? He will say: I am sick, please do not come. Then what do we do?Mikoyan: If he is sick, that is okay, we will go directly to his villa to find him. Usually when they rest outside [the city], there are three or four Politburo members there together.Chairman: Currently Kim Il Sung has hostile sentiments towards us. Originally he had planned to come to Beijing for the 8th [Chinese Communist] Party Congress, but all of a sudden he notified us that he is sick; and therefore cannot come. Mikoyan: He is dissatisfied that you did not return those who had escaped.Chairman: Kim Il Sung knew that you were coming, and if he came then [we] would certainly discuss the Korea issue with him. Mikoyan: Yes, therefore, he decided not to come.Chairman: When you go [to North Korea] this time, Kim Il Sung will say: In the past you interfered with Yugoslavia and now you want to interfere with me. In the past, when Yugoslavia was interfered with, there was only the Soviet Union, and now China has been added as well. (Laughter).Mikoyan: Last time, it was our mistake.Chairman: I say, we need to tell Kim Il Sung that we are not trying to overthrow him, we have come to help you but you have to correct your style.Mikoyan: Indeed, no one among us is preparing to overthrow him. Chairman: We need to tell Kim Il Sung: your method of knocking [people] down cannot go on, it will only sharpen the contradictions within the party. Today you may have knocked them down, but maybe tomorrow they will still overthrow you. If this goes on, your party and your task will be in danger!Mikoyan: My opinion is that after we arrive we should talk with Kim Il Sung alone and tell him our views clearly, tell him that we are indeed there to help him. [We should tell him:] your method is incorrect and it must change. It is not good if you do not change it.Chairman: Indeed, we should persuade them to reach reconciliation. Kim Il Sung should admit that mistakes have been made in the past. At the same time, we should also persuade those who had been fixed to adopt a conciliatory attitude. The issues must be clarified and we should persuade them to adopt a cooperative attitude towards Kim Il Sung. Mikoyan: Indeed, this is a good direction. We should persuade both sides to adopt a conciliatory attitude. Chairman: We must also prepare for another point, that is, Kim Il Sung may say that we are interfering with his affairs; he may want us to withdraw our troops.Mikoyan: Do you reckon he will really raise the issue in this way?Chairman: It is difficult to say. We are willing to withdraw our troops. The current situation is that the Americans are in the South and Syngman Rhee has a large force. It was Kim Il Sung who requested that we keep the [People’s] Volunteer Army [in North Korea]. Mikoyan: It probably won’t come to him raising this issue! It is true that he does not like us asking him about their party affairs. But exchanging views and mutual criticism between fraternal parties is entirely allowed. The interests of the Korean party, the interests of the Korean people and the interests of the entire Socialist camp are intimately connected. After the 20th Congress of the CPSU, there were also abnormal phenomena inside the Hungarian party. I was on vacation at the time, and went to Hungary. Now it seems that I also interfered in their internal affairs. I interfered but the problem was resolved. A lot of people were arrested in Rakosi’s times. After the 20th Congress, the CC decided to release a lot of people. In the streets people often cried out against Rakosi. In reality they opposed the Party Central Committee. Chairman: Rakosi was a good man. His level of Marxism-Leninism was very high. Comrade Rakosi could be removed but it is difficult to deal with Kim Il Sung. Mikoyan: Comrade Rakosi was also unwilling to be removed at first. There was a five thousand-strong assembly in the street; the masses used loudspeakers to shout out against the Hungarian Central Committee. Even the Party press published articles against the CC. The editor of the party newspaper is a Central Committee member but he was a CC member who did not obey the CC. The Party Central Committee already lost prestige inside the party, it already could not form the leading group. The party discipline was extremely lax. I intentionally told Rakosi: as these people are against the party, against the Central Committee, and against the government, one can arrest them. Rakosi said: I have not arrested anyone. You arrest a few people today and tomorrow there is going to be even more people shouting against the party and against the government. Rakosi already lost prestige among the masses. The masses say: Rakosi just wants to allow a little democracy today, to relax the situation a bit, and when the situation stabilizes in the future, he will again arrest people. The masses already did not believe him. In 1948 when the Labour Party merged with the Social Democratic Party, the Social Democratic Party had more than 200,000 party members. The Labour Party absorbed into its Central Committee more than thirty leaders from the Social Democracy Party. After the merger, within a few years, all of these thirty plus were arrested, this was simply a political scam. Already at that time comrade Rakosi became the sole target of the anti-party [activities] of the party opposition. I pointed out at a meeting of the Politburo of the Hungarian Party that if comrade Rakosi considers the party interests, he himself should resign. After I made this proposal, not one participant of the Politburo meeting spoke up to express a [contrary?] attitude. Then, comrade Rakosi understood at last. He said: if my departure is in the party’s interests, I can leave. I told comrade Rakosi: to be honest, to preserve prestige, it would be better to step down now. This way, when you die, you can take some remaining prestige with you into the grave. Otherwise, after half a year, it’ll all run out. In the end comrade Rakosi decided to resign, and everyone agreed. Two former Social Democratic Party members were restored to the Politburo, one full, one candidate.[1] The new Central Committee has a larger quota. Each provincial secretariat promoted some new young and promising [people]. After the election of the new Central Committee, they demanded that the party paper obeys the Party Central Committee leadership, it cannot go on opposing the party. The editorial board had two bad elements; afterwards, they were expelled, and the party newspaper came to defend the party position. After things were handled in this way, the entire party was satisfied. You say: interference. Is this not interference? After [we] interfered, comrades said: thank you, you saved our party. The Hungarian situation was very complicated. The Americans were shouting every day, saying the Hungarian Party should step down. How can we allow a ruling Communist Party in a socialist country to step down? It’s impossible. It’s absolutely impossible. Chairman: Good. Let’s drink a cup of wine! (Meal begins). Mikoyan: Hungary used to have a Prime Minister called [Imre] Nagy. He made rightist mistakes in work. It was correct to dismiss him. But it was not appropriate to expell him from the party. After Nagy was dismissed, he was expelled from the Central Committee. After half a year he was also expelled from the party. After another half year [they] just would not give him work, [they] wanted him to pass his days drawing a pension. He did not do it; he demanded work for himself. Chairman: All of these methods are the methods of digging one’s own grave.Mikoyan: I saw Nagy in Hungary and asked him whether he wanted to return to the party. He said that of course he was willing to return to the party, that he can’t live without the party. He believes that it was correct to dismiss him but it was wrong to expel him from the party. I told him: if you want to be readmitted to the party, you should admit to the party the past mistakes that you had made; if you want to make your way back to the party through struggle, it won’t do. It is also not in your interest. To be honest, if you do it like this, you will isolate yourself from the party. I spoke sharply, so as to make him understand: he should not haggle with the party. He has mistakes, and he should admit them to the party. He saw that Poland’s Gomulka was restored to party membership but did not announce that he was admitting his mistakes. He [Nagy] also hoped he’d be restored his party membership without admitting mistakes. Gomulka also was expelled from the party for making rightist mistakes. When he was being restored to the party, comrade Ochab went to talk to him. He agreed to restore his [Gomulka’s] party membership but did not ask that he admits his mistakes. Rakosi really listened to Stalin. Whatever Stalin wanted he did. He never opposed Stalin. Their thinking was completely the same. Chairman: What do you think of Kim Il Sung?Mikoyan: Kim Il Sung is almost [like this]. He doesn’t really get it. After the 20th CPSU Congress, there was chaos and crisis in many of the fraternal parties. There was also a great upsurge in the Polish party. Comrade Bierut died suddenly. However, people still had opinions about him. (Turns to a different topic). Chairman: (Pointing to the First Secretary of Uzbekistan’s Party CC Mukhitdinov) This comrade is very young. Mikoyan: He is only 38 years old. He is my successor. Chairman (to Mukhitdinov): You could live to the 21st century.[2] Mukhitdinov: In a Communist society, all people should live to 150 years. You will all live long lives. Mikoyan: He was just elected at the 20th Congress; he is very tender, like the fresh cucumbers we are having. Their cotton harvest [in Uzbekistan] is very good this year. They are now taking measures to turn 500,000 ha of wasteland into arable land in four years. In the future, [they will] be able to collect 1,100,000 tons of seed cotton or 300,000 tons of lint. This piece of land is not his. It’s Kazakhstan Republic’s. As the land is vast and people are sparse there, we have decided to give it to him. It is very close to where they are. Chairman: This is a just aggression. It can even be approved by the United Nations. (Laugh). Mikoyan: This is by an agreement of the two sides. It’s not a UN business. Yudin: The UN doesn’t know. If it knew, it could interfere. Mikoyan: They obtained 500,000 ha of land without going to war. Mukhitdinov: When we begin cultivating this land, we plan to invest 4.6 billion rubles. Our republic’s population is only 7.3 million people. This year we can deliver to the state 3 million tons of cotton. The cotton harvest is very good this year. Mikoyan: The Soviet Union’s grain harvest is also quite good this year. Last year the cotton production plan could not be fully completed [but] this year it will be completed. This year, sugar beet and hemp [harvest] can exceed the plan.Chairman: How far are you from Xinjiang? Mukhitdinov: We do not have a direct border with Xinjiang but we are close to China.Chairman: Oh! We are neighbors. Mukhitdinov: Development of these wastelands requires 100 thousand migrants. Mikoyan: He is very ambitious. He also wants to have tea plantations there; when the railroad is built in the future, he can sell the tea to China. (The conversation returns to the original topic). Chairman: Good! Let’s talk about Kim Il Sung again. Recently they published an article saying that after the 20th Congress of the CPSU, Imperialism has been doing everything in its power to undermine Communist and Workers’ parties in every country. It said that there are some people inside the Korean Workers’ Party who want to undermine unity. These people are carrying out the wishes of Imperialism, that they and Imperialism echo one another. They’ve connected the people who oppose them with Imperialism. Mikoyan: They want to demonstrate logically that they are not at fault, and that only the people opposing them are wrong. Chairman: Maybe Kim Il Sung really thinks that. As I see it, think thinking does not end with Kim Il Sung. The CC Plenum convened for two days. During the first day’s meeting, [when] those who were expressing criticism had not yet finished speaking, more than ten people got up demanding that these speeches be stopped, and the majority in the hall did not express their views. Nam Il, by contrast, called on them to finish speaking. It looks like Nam Il perhaps shares the CC’s opinion. Mikoyan: Nam Il participated in the conversation at the CC CPSU in Moscow. At the time Pak Jung-ae was also present. There is information that the people who criticized Kim Il Sung demanded to have Choe Yong-gon and Pak Jung-ae dismissed from their jobs. These two are in complete agreement with Kim Il Sung. Kim Tu-bong discovered that things weren’t right but he did not dare to express his attitude. In fact, Kim Tu-bong is a good comrade.Chairman: In the last few years, Kim Tu-bong wanted to visit China but Kim Il Sung would not let him come. Mikoyan: Comrade Kim Tu-bong is a good man. He is very reliable politically. Chairman: He is a scholar. Mikoyan: His orientation is also appropriate. Chairman: When you go this time, let’s estimate, how much support can you get? Probably the majority of the [Plenum] meeting will support you. Probably, those who did not dare to speak out will support you. Mikoyan: To convince them to reconcile is correct. It is in the interest of all of us. Chairman: One should not do the “you die I live” thing. What’s the advantage [of that]? Today I rise up to overthrow you. Tomorrow you rise up to overthrow me. It’s no good. Even the capitalist class has a two-party system! The U.S. has two parties. Eisenhower came into power and Truman was not locked up! This point is a little better with the capitalist class than with feudalism. China has many parties. There is the CCP, and there are also many democratic parties. We are all in power. We are a multi-party system. I told the democratic parties’ friends: if there was no Communist Party, the democratic parties could not exist. Who would vote for them? Mikoyan: The Democratic Party are your agents. (Laughing). Chairman: So I told them, we have to have long-term cooperation. Mikoyan: After a class is eliminated, that class’s ideology will still remain for a long time. It’s like a snake: you chop the head off, and its body can wriggle as if alive for a long time. Chairman: We say that the Communist party is around today, it will be around tomorrow, and it will die off the day after tomorrow, and the democratic parties are also like that: around today, around tomorrow, and they will die off the day after tomorrow; it is not like it is around today and they will die off tomorrow. Mikoyan: So you are called “Two ‘Long Lives!’”Chairman: We tell people from the democratic parties: as long as exist, you will exist. They were very happy to hear it. To be honest, the democratic parties help us a lot. Mikoyan: What you are doing is completely correct.Chairman: All of their criticism comes from the right side, making some of our comrades who easily fall into leftism watch out. Mikoyan: Long Live or not, when the classes have been eliminated, their [the democratic parties’] foundation will anyway disappear. Chairman: We are not afraid of their criticism. If it is correct, we listen. If it is incorrect, we don’t have to do it. Mikoyan: I heard at the Congress how the democratic parties’ [representatives] all said that they are advancing “under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party.” This serves to show that you have educated them well. Chairman: What attitude should we take to people inside the party who committed mistakes, people inside the party who dissent? One can have two methods. One is Kim Il Sung’s method. These people there [in North Korea] who committed so called mistakes in fact did not commit any mistakes. I am talking about people who really committed mistakes. They commit mistakes, you still want to give them a job, you still want to let them eat, you can’t knock them down in one blow, you have to give them an opportunity to correct their mistakes. We in China had two famous lines. One was the Wang Ming line. One was the Li Lisan line. At this Congress they were still elected to the Central Committee. Mikoyan: Were they elected at the 7th Congress? Chairman: Yes. They were elected to the Central Committee at the 7th Congress. We only persuaded the representatives to elect them after a great effort. This time, too, it took an effort to persuade the representatives. Everyone was very dissatisfied with them. We said: to elect is better than not to elect. This is not an individual problem. They represent the people from the petit bourgeois class inside the party. When they were emperors in the party, their policy was that if you listen to them, you ascended Heaven, whereas if you criticized them, you were overthrown. We can’t use these methods of theirs against them. If this is the right thing to do, electing them does no harm, all it takes is adding two names to the Central Committee. Mikoyan: Yes. It does no harm. Chairman: This hasn’t the slightest influence on the [policy] line. Perhaps some people think: people who made mistakes can be Central Committee members - well, then, let me also make mistakes! I don’t think that there are people like this. Mikoyan: What you have said about taking this kind of realistic, correct attitude towards people who have committed mistakes is something I heard you say in February 1949, when I visited China. At the time it made a deep impression on me. After I returned to the Soviet Union, I recounted this to Stalin without missing a word. At the time I wanted Stalin to understand your meaning. However, after I finished speaking, Stalin did not utter a word. His methods were the opposite of yours. Although he did not say it, he understood [what I was referring to]. I know he did not agree with that. At the time of the 4th [sic, should be 10th] CPSU Party Congress, there was an opposition faction inside the party – [Aleksandr] Shlyapnikov and others. Lenin was still alive at the time. The Bolshevik representatives did not put forward the initiative of electing him to the Central Committee. Lenin was opposed to this view. He said: one should let them come in. They represent certain things. Chairman: One needs some rightists and leftists, there is no need for uniformity. Mikoyan: The party can make a united decision and force the opposition to implement it. At the time the opposition was mainly the anarchist workers’ [opposition]. One could criticize their mistaken leaning but one should still elect their representatives to the Central Committee. When Lenin expressed these views, Stalin was also present. At the time he agreed, but after the passage of some ten years, he forgot everything.Chairman: Yes. This experience of yours is good. The opposition factions could be preserved. Mikoyan: The Soviet opposition factions were no longer opposed to the party for a fairly long time but later they were still eliminated. For instance, [Nikolai] Bukharin. The party’s struggle with him happened in 1928. Afterwards, for 6 or 8 years he was not at all opposed to the party. But in 1936 he was still killed. At the time he did not pose any obstacles for the party. I don’t understand why Stalin did that. Perhaps he worried that if these people remained there would be a latent danger. Otherwise, why couldn’t he not kill them? This is just my guess.Chairman: This is because [he] did not believe in the masses. So, he was afraid daily. Mikoyan: Before the 19th Congress, Stalin already started to suspect comrade Molotov and me. He wanted to get rid of us, raised new people, [but] then he did not trust these new people. To be honest, I ardently loved Stalin for fifteen years. I loved him more than I loved anyone else. But later it was not the same. I clearly remember one episode. In 1950 I and comrade Khrushchev together went to [Stalin’s] dacha in Sochi to see Stalin. One morning everyone was having tea at Stalin’s place. Suddenly Stalin told the two of us very seriously and sternly that he believed that his life was in serious danger, and in his innermost heart he was extremely depressed. I and comrade Khrushchev were shocked to hear that. Stalin said he did not trust anyone. Sometimes he did not trust even himself. I and comrade Khrushchev can never forget those words of his. A leader openly admitting that his innermost heart is empty is very said. Before Stalin died, we expressed not a few opinions to him but no one adhered to factional, organizational, or group sentiments. It was not that we had no divergence at the time on international questions and on the agricultural question – we had divergence. Stalin believed in general that since there are different opinions, there has to be a plot somewhere. Stalin believed in general that there are people who oppose him. After Stalin died, we did not immediately begin opposing him because at the time a good impression [of Stalin] was still very deeply embedded in our minds, there were many certainties. Only before the 20th Congress did we substantially consult the archival materials. Only when we looked at the archives that we discovered the problems. In the past we were suspicious about many cases, we had an idea but no evidence. But later a lot of problems were discovered. Originally we all thought that the mistakes in the purges could be blamed on the Ministry of State Security, which gave fake materials to Stalin, and that Stalin was hoodwinked and taken in. Now, only after looking at a lot of the archives that we discovered that this wasn’t the case. In the archives we found a lot of letters to Stalin from people who were forced to confess their guilt, expressing their innocence. Among these letters we found a plea to Stalin written personally by Bukharin before his execution. Chairman: Did your Politburo comrades not see any of these letters at the time?Mikoyan: None of the Politburo comrades knew anything. There had not been a real Politburo meeting for many years, and the meetings that did take place were usually procedural. We saw the originals of these letters and were greatly pained. Bukharin’s letter said that he was innocent, that he never betrayed the party, never opposed the people, and not only that he did not oppose Stalin but that he exceedingly loved and esteemed him. Bukharin requested that he not be sentenced by placed in whatever position to be tested, like to run a school or to manage a farm, so that he vindicates himself through practical works. But later Stalin still approved Bukharin’s execution. No one knew about these things. The verdicts were all written ahead of time. Court trials were just for the form because before the trials the defendants were already sentenced to death. In the archives [we] discovered a letter written by [Janis] Rudzutaks before his execution, which blamed the court for completely breaking socialist legality. At the time we only saw a small note about Rudzutaks being a spy, we did not see any documents from the defense. We only discovered all of that before the 20th Congress. Then there was comrade [Robert] Eikhe. He was Estonian. At the time he was a deputy member of the Politburo. Because he was tortured, he could not handle it, so he confessed, saying that he was an Estonian nationalism, that he never entered the party. This forced false confession was circulated at the time but before his death he left a letter, recounting the injustice of the circumstances of his confession. This letter was discovered only later. Chairman: Extracting confession for punishment is a remnant of feudalism. Mikoyan: This is a method of the Persian kings from the Middle Ages. Chairman: We also have this sort of thing. Say a peasant joins the revolution, becomes a cadre, becomes a chief of a country public security bureau, obtaining great power overnight. He can use these sorts of methods. In 1929 we raised the question of abolishing corporal punishment in the Red Army. But it can’t be abolished in one go. Mikoyan: After the 19th CPSU Congress, the Central Committee convened a plenum. A lot of us raised the question of the decline in agricultural production. We said: life in the countryside is no good because the [state] purchase price for milk is inappropriate. A lot of milk cows had died, and there is a great shortage of dairy products. Because a lot of people reflected on these circumstances, the Central Committee decided to establish a special commission. Comrade Khrushchev, comrade Ponomarev and I participated in this commission. We spent a month’s labor, conducted research and investigation and unanimously proposed to adjust the selling prices for agricultural products. We drew up an adjustment program. We knew at the time that Stalin would oppose it. So we raised with Stalin only a half of the projected range of adjustments, thinking to let Stalin first agree to the first step, and then in the future raise the second step. This first step program was given to Stalin two months before his death. Stalin said: your method if [Aleksei] Rykov’s method. Stalin did not accept these proposals. On the contrary, he organized a commission with [Georgii] Malenkov and [Lavrentii] Beria participating, to consider the question of increasing taxes. But the members of this commission also believed that if one raised taxes, the peasants would rebel. They believed that disabled veterans, pensioners, military men and their families would all have to pay taxes, and these people originally did not pay taxes. Stalin asked: if you collect taxes in this way, how many tax-payers will you have? According to statistic, you would have 5 million households. Then Stalin decided to postpone tax increases. Stalin was afraid. He feared that if it was not done well, then really there would be a rebellion. Until Stalin’s death the first program on the adjustment of purchase prices for agricultural products was not approved, so it was not necessary to put forward the second program. We all felt that in the few years before Stalin’s death, it was very difficult for everyone to get along with him. Chairman: When there is only one party in a country, it is even more important to hear the views of the opposition. Mikoyan: We now insist on the principle of democratic centralism. We have meetings. Meetings discuss questions. After ample discussion, questions are put to a vote. Our Central Committee has different views on certain matters. We resolutely discuss these divergences. For example, on the question of the Yugoslav Communist Party, we had three large-scale discussions over a two-month period, and only then was a decision taken. Not having an ample discussion, and putting the question straight to a vote is not a [good] method for resolving problems. After a discussion, people who began to have doubts or those who opposed will, perhaps, ultimately agree with the correct view. Chairman: To understand something requires a process. Mikoyan: Some people do not agree at first but after discussion and criticism they abandon their opinions. Similarly, we came here to have this meeting, but it’s impossible for us to share the same view immediately after we are seated.Chairman: If someone couldn’t understand [the consensus], [we] may just leave him in that confusion.Mikoyan: As long as there is a unanimous resolution. Chairman: However, one cannot spread leaflets. Wang Ming did not acknowledge that his line was mistaken but he said that the current line of the Central Committee is correct. He did not say a word about his own mistakes. Chairman [sic]: We also did not force him. You can’t do it by force. It has to come from heart. Mikoyan: Today his problem is no longer political but historical. Chairman: He is still useful. He is useful in our education of party members. The whole party, the whole country, the whole world have heard of these two people, Wang Ming and Li Lisan. Mikoyan: A strong party allows. A weak party fears, and does not dare to leave such people around. The important thing is to have a strong party leadership core, to have real Marxists-Leninists. It does no harm to leave such people in the party. Chairman: The democratic parties are useful. They are mainly rightists in the United Front. They frequently curse us. [It is fine] as long as they don’t publish it in the newspapers. Mikoyan: The advantage is being able to hear criticism. If you did not have them, you could feel isolated. Is there a socialist party among the Chinese democratic party?Zhou: It is not called socialist in name but in fact there is. They are for socialism, and their direction is also socialist. Only, they have no relations with foreign socialist parties. Mikoyan: Now socialist parties have two groupings, the European and the Asian. This November all the socialist parties of Asia will meet in India. It would be best to get in there. Chairman: This is very difficult because China’s democratic parties openly acknowledged and, moreover, declared that they would carry out work under the leadership of the CCP. Secondly, they are socialist in name [but] these parties have historically never had any connection with foreign socialist parties. Mikoyan: One can say, in form, that they agree with the Communist Party’s initiatives. They should not say: we obey CCP leadership. This way, when one party obeys another party’s leadership, is not too good. Relationship of obedience is useful domestically but has [negative] influence on international activities. Foreign socialist parties can say that it is just an appendix to the CCP. Chinese comrades can consider whether there is a way to get into the congress of Asian socialist parties that will take place this November in India. European socialist parties approve of colonialism but Asian socialist parties oppose colonialism. Chairman: This question can be considered. Mikoyan: In Europe only the Yugoslav Communist Party has relations with socialist parties, and participates in their meetings. I think one party is too few. See whether one can get in as an observer in Asia. Does comrade Ho Chi Minh have socialist parties over there [in Vietnam]?Chairman: One can see whether Vietnam has them or not and whether they can go or not. Mikoyan: When European socialist parties opened their meeting, the CPSU sent them a congratulatory telegram. Chairman: Were they happy?Mikoyan: They did not announce that the Soviet Union sent a congratulatory telegram. If they don’t announce it, that is no loss either. We said only the good things, supporting the spirit of Bandung, opposing colonialism, mentioning peaceful co-existence and other nice things. Chairman: Among Asia’s socialist parties, Japan’s and India’s are relatively good. Indonesia’s is the worst. Mikoyan: I have been in contact with people from Burma’s socialist parties. They have a leftist and a rightist faction. They originally agreed to send a delegation to the Soviet Union but later due to domestic elections, [when] Ba Swe became the Prime Minister, they did not go. Chairman: Let’s still talk about Kim Il Sung’s business! What sort of meeting do you think would be good? One have two kinds: one kind is an extended Politburo meeting, with a little more people; the best would be a Central Committee plenum. This I am afraid Kim Il Sung won’t do, because he just had one and it was bad. This time, when you come and force him to convene [a plenum], I am afraid Kim Il Sung won’t do it. It won’t do for his face. The Politburo overturning a Central Committee Plenum decision – this is not in accordance with the law. The power of your visit is tremendous. They are also splitting internally these days. I think there are many people among them who want the Soviet Union and China to send people to help them resolve problems. Kim Il Sung may also think there is no way out, perhaps he will agree to open a plenum. Mikoyan: I think there is perhaps a possibility. If we raise this, it will be hard for him to refuse. Chairman: It would be best to write a resolution; otherwise there will be no evidence after the fact. After you go, they’ll make noise again. After the resolution has been passed, it also needs to be published. Mikoyan: First, we will invite Kim Il Sung, Pak Jung-ae and Nam Il for a conversation, [try to] persuade them to open a meeting. I think politically they have no really to oppose. Chairman: How many days to you reckon it will take. One, two days won’t do. Mikoyan: Two days won’t do?Chairman: As I see it, it will take four days. Peng: I think it will take seven days. Mikoyan: Recently comrade Khrushchev also wanted to go to Yugoslavia. Before he goes we need to come down, so I need to go back quickly. Chairman: You have to talk to a lot of people while there. Peng: The South Korean faction can raise the question of Pak Heon-yeong. Mikoyan: One has to convince these people not to stir history. The man is no longer around, and there is a lot of unclear gossip. Chairman: Let us not talk about the past anymore! I am afraid you would need to stay for four or five days. The Pak Heon-yeong case is very complicated. Mikoyan: We will temporarily leave it unsettled and first see what the situation is like!Chairman: This time we are counting on you. They do not listen to the Chinese.Mikoyan: I also do not know if they will listen. They may well listen but what they will do is another matter. Chairman: They don’t listen to China at all, and they don’t listen to you three quarters of the time. Mikoyan: I really do not understand them.Chairman: He is afraid that our two parties are digging at his wall.Mikoyan: This time we will talk with him frankly.Chairman: To be honest, if they do not change, even if no one digs at their wall, it will still collapse.Mikoyan: It seems forcing those [escapees] to return to [North] Korea will be difficult.Chairman: It is okay if they do not return!Mikoyan: [They can] live abroad for one or two years, and then we will see. Chairman: This way, they will say that we are protecting their counter-revolutionary elements.Mikoyan: We are socialist countries, I think he won’t say that.Chairman: There is currently a tense situation between the Soviet Union, China and [North] KoreaMikoyan: Actually, there already has been a conflict between China and [North] Korea. Their people escaped and you have harbored them. They came to ask for those people, but you have refused to turn them over; is that not conflict?Chairman: They will say, now you are protecting those people, in the future you will oppose us.Mikoyan: I can tell him that we are not prepared to use those people to oppose Kim Il Sung.Chairman: If Kim Il Sung’s heart were wider then it would be better. If he is like Stalin, then it will be very difficult.Mikoyan: This is mainly an issue of face. The resolution passed during [their] central plenary meeting was not very good.Chairman: We need to persuade Kim Il Sung to not view those who had escaped as traitors. They certainly would not want those people [the escapees] to crush Kim Il Sung’s eggs.Mikoyan: That is very correct.Chairman: If we do not speak clearly, it will cause suspicion and enmity. Mikoyan: Comrade Mao Zedong! We will implement this direction. We suggest that Choe Yong-geon return to [North Korea] with us. Chairman: [I] suggest that the ambassadors to [North] Korea from both of our countries should join the party delegation. The delegation will consist of eight people. Mikoyan: We will converse with Choe Yong-geon and ask him if he is willing to go with us. Chairman: We intend to invite [the North Korean delegation] for a conversation.Mikoyan: We intend to be on the move tomorrow morning.Chairman: We will invite Choe Yong-geon for a conversation tonight. Since they first came, they have expressed willingness to discuss this issue with us. We can finish the conversation before 11PM, and then we will ask Choe Yong-geon to go to the residence of comrade Mikoyan.Mikoyan: I will be waiting to meet Choe Yong-geon. Regarding the affair of our visit, I asked Choe Yong-geon to report to their Central Committee.Chairman: Okay! Let us adjourn![1] There is lack of clarity in this sentence, which also contains a reference to the “Party Press,” but this seems to a typo or a fragment of a different sentence.

      "Secret[to the] CPSU CCA conversation with the Chinese comrades was held today, [inserted by hand: 18 September], which lasted from 1800 to 2200. Our delegation and Cdes. Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Peng Dehuai, Deng Xiaoping, and Wang Jiaxiang were present. The conversation was mainly about the issue of the situation in the Korean Worker's Party.We said that the CPSU CC had charged us with exchanging opinions with the CC of the Communist Party of China about the situation in the Korean Worker's Party. We do not have complete information about this situation, but the facts which are known to us demonstrate an [in the handwritten version: absolutely] unhealthy situation and a violation of the Leninist norms of Party life in the KWP. We then provided information about the advice which was given Kim Il Sung during his last visit in Moscow. As is known, Kim Il Sung promised to take into account the comments of the CPSU CC Presidium and to correct the situation in the Party. However, the facts show that Kim Il Sung is acting to the contrary, which was clearly demonstrated by the 3rd KWP CC plenum, where a number of CC members who had criticized the shortcomings which exist were expelled from the Party.After the plenum Kim Il Sung informed the Soviet ambassador in Pyongyang that the situation had been normalized after the expulsion of several CC members from the Party and Party unity had been strengthened. [Translator's note: in the handwritten version the following sentence was inserted at this point, then crossed out: \"We completely disagree with such an assessment\"] We still do not have a final opinion, which we will draw up after familiarization with the situation on the scene.Cde. Mao Zedong provided information about what that they have on this issue. Their information matches ours. In addition, Cde. Mao Zedong provided information that many Party members in Korea had been arrested, whose entire fault was that they criticize the situation in the Party. Pak Il-u, who is known to the Chinese comrades as a good Communist and honest person, has long been under arrest.After a mutual [exchange] of information we said that both our Parties ought to help the KWP leadership correct the mistakes, saying at the same time that we trust Kim Il Sung but we cannot regard the unacceptable methods in the work of the KWP leadership with approval. We proposed sending a joint delegation of the CPSU and CCP to Pyongyang, stating that Cdes. Mikoyan, Mukhitdinov, and Ponomarev could go from our side.Mao Zedong agreed with our proposal. Half-seriously, half in jest, he said that a tension had been created in the relations between the USSR and the PRC, on the one side, and the KWP leadership, on the other, had been created as a result of all the actions of Kim Il Sung. Cde. Mao Zedong said that Kim Il Sung has a feeling of hostility toward our Parties. Right now he thinks that our Parties are acting with respect to the KWP the same way as they acted with respect to Yugoslavia at one time. In response to this we said that mistakes were made then with respect to Yugoslavia. Right now both our Parties are acting correctly. We cannot regard the fate of the KWP indifferently and consider it our international duty to help correct the situation in it.Agreeing with [in the handwritten version: the issue we raised] this, Cde. Mao Zedong noted that Kim Il Sung understood that we do not want to overthrow him, but want to help him. It is necessary to let Kim Il Sung know all the same that he cannot remain in the leadership without correction of the mistakes. But, said Mao Zedong, it is necessary to be prepared for extreme steps from Kim Il Sung. He might even raise the issue of the withdrawal of the Chinese volunteers from Korea. Of course, the Chinese units want to return home, but we know that the Americans are strengthening their positions in South Korea and we consider it necessary to leave our volunteers in Korea.We said that we are excluding such a posing of the question on the part of Kim Il Sung.Cde. Mao Zedong declared that our proposal about a trip to Pyongyang by CPSU CC and CCP CC representatives for talks with the KWP leadership is fortuitous and the only correct [proposal].Peng Dehuai, Nie [Rongzhen], and a third comrade might go from the CCP CC. The Soviet and PRC ambassadors to the DPRK ought to also take part in the meeting with the Korean comrades so that they are informed and, remaining after the departure of the delegation from Korea, might observe the implementation of what the delegation agrees with the KWP leadership.Cde. Mao Zedong suggested that the KWP CC adopt at least a brief resolution during the delegation's stay in Pyongyang which ought to be published in the press. Otherwise, he said, it might happen that Kim Il Sung would give a promise to correct the mistakes but everything would remain the old way. We agreed with him.[We] discussed the issue of where was more suitable to consider the situation which had been created, in the presidium or in the KWP CC plenum. We came to the following conclusion. At first our joint delegation will talk frankly with Kim Il Sung, declaring to him that we intend to support and help him, to reconcile the quarrelling sides in the Party, and rally [them] around him. But this is possible only if the mistakes which have been committed are corrected [deleted in the handwritten version: reprisals against honest Party members are halted], and the Leninist norms of Party life are observed.At first Cde. Mao Zedong said that [we] ought to suggest returning to the DPRK and reinstating the KWP CC members who fled Korea. But when we noted that this would put Kim Il Sung [inserted by hand in the handwritten version: and the CC plenum] in a difficult position and he could not agree to this because of prestige, especially since he had bound the CC members with the resolution which had been adopted about the expulsion of these CC members from the Party, then Mao Zedong agreed with this.It was arranged that the delegation would declare to Kim Il Sung that our Parties would take steps so that the Korean Communists who had refused to return to the DPRK would not pursue work [in the handwritten version: speak out/ act vystupili] against the KWP leadership.Mao Zedong said, it would be incorrect right now for one group to overthrow another in Korea since the group which had been overthrown might begin the struggle all over again, which would lead to a serious crisis in the DPRK. Cde. Mao Zedong expressed doubt that Kim Il Sung might agree to convene a CC plenum. To this we replied that Kim Il Sung has no political motives for such a refusal.It was evident from everything that the issue about relations with the KWP has become a painful issue for the Chinese comrades. During the conversation Cdes. Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, and Peng Dehuai more than once made comments demonstrating their critical attitude toward Kim Il Sung and that they had discussed this issue recently and had been informed about all the details of the situation in the KWP CC.Peng Dehuai asked that we reply to the questions of KWP CC members (and such will turn up) about the case of Pak Heonyeong.We replied that there is no sense for us to stir up this matter right now. It is necessary not to deal with old matters, but to discuss the issue of the correction of the shortcomings which exist in the KWP and about the establishment of a normal routine in the work of its governing bodies.We suggested that Cde. Choe Yong-geon, the leader of the KWP delegation to the 8th CCP congress, inform Kim Il Sung about the trip of our delegation to Pyongyang, and that the former go with us to Pyongyang. Cde. Mao Zedong agreed with this. He said that he will invite Choe Yong-geon to his place right now, talk with him, and send him to us.We favored finishing work in Pyongyang in two or three days. Peng Dehuai said that it would take a week. Mao Zedong thinks that it will take five days for this. It was arranged not to set a deadline today so that the necessary work would be done on the scene without dragging out the matter.At the end of the conversation Mao Zedong said that the success of the matter depends on the CPSU delegation since the Koreans do not listen to the advice of the Communist Party of China. In connection with this we said that, as is well known, Kim Il Sung agreed with the advice of the CPSU CC, but acted otherwise.To this Mao Zedong noted that the KWP leadership does not listen to the CCP advice 100%, and it does not listen to you 30%. We said that we will try to take every step in order to carry out those steps about which we agreed just now together with the Korean comrades in Pyongyang.We fly to Pyongyang on 19 August [SIC] at 7 A. M. together with the Chinese and Korean comrades.19 September 1956\tA. MIKOYAN[handwritten: authenticated: V.

He expressed that he fully supports the resolutions of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, [as well as] China’s Great Leap Forward, the People’s Communes, our general [political] line, and our opposition to Peng Dehuai’s right opportunist anti-Party clique. Kim said that the Korean [Workers’] Party is not surprised by Peng Dehuai’s opposition to the [Chinese Communist] Party and that this is [in fact] completely understandable. The Central Committee of the Korean Workers’ Party had quite a few concerns about Peng Dehuai in the past, but did not raise these [questions about Peng to the Chinese Communist Party] out of a broader interest in protecting the unity of the two [Chinese and Korean] parties. During the trip to Beijing, [Kim said that] [Mao and Liu] might find an opportunity to discuss this issue with our Party.Qiao Xiaoguang21 September 1959\n",

      "TELEGRAM 085.304To: the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs From: the Romanian Embassy in Washington, D.C.Date: September 21st, 1978 Classification: SecretSubject: KoreaDavid Blakemore, deputy head of the Korea desk at the State Department, told Comrade Petre Anghel, Third Secretary: The American-South Korean relations are currently going through a calmer period, determined by the termination of the Koreagate affair (acts of corruption led by South-Korean representatives in the United States of America), but also by the salience in the US foreign policy agenda of problems like the Middle East , relations with the USSR.The Congressional approval of the Legislation regarding the American military equipment –worth 800 million US dollars - that will be left in South Korea after the withdrawal of American troops, contributed to this [calmer period] as well. The same legislation stipulates the sum of 275 million dollars as credits for selling military equipment.This turn of events allow the continuation of the retreat of US troops at the proposed rate – 2400 soldiers by the end of the current year and 3600 soldiers in 1979.Regarding the discussion of the Korean question at the [next] session of UN General Assembly, the US has no clue if the Korean question is on the agenda and it  hopes that it will not be [introduced], because such discussion would be sterile and detrimental to the discussion of problems of immediate concern.Regarding the attitude of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, the American diplomat mentioned one aspect which [he noticed] in the recent speech of the president Kim Il Sung in which he said that for the peaceful reunification of Korea 3 conditions are necessary: the modifications of South Korea’s constitution , the liberty of the political parties, and the change of the South Korean government. The novelty of this remark consists in the fact that until now, the three conditions were referring to the beginning of the discussions for reunification, which hints to the fact that the North Koreans wish to resume the North-South discussions. Of course, this declaration will have to be confirmed by the actions that the North Koreans will undertake.An interesting element is the attitude of the Soviet Union towards South Korea. Lately, a South Korean sport team has performed in the USSR and the South Korean ministry of health was granted the permission to take part that the session of the World Health Organization, but he also requested a separate meeting with the minister of health of USSR. The US interprets this attitude as a wish of the USSR to initiate economic relations with South Korea, which has one of the prosperous economies in the Pacific region.SignedIon Besteliu\n",

      "TELEGRAM 066.918To: the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (to comrade Vasile Sandru)From: the Romanian Embassy in PyongyangSubject: Korean-Egyptian relationsDate: September 22nd, 1978 Classification: SecretFrom the conversations between Aurel Bulcu and Second Secretary [in Pyongyang] M. Kotb, we gathered the following:With respect to North Korea’s relations with Arab countries, [Pyongyang] is paying special attention to its relations with Egypt.In this respect, we would like to note the participation of the Egyptian governmental delegation at the ceremonies celebrating 30 years since the creation of the DPRK. The Egyptian delegation, led by Mustapha Kamal Helmi, the Egyptian Minister of Education and State Minister for Scientific Research, visited the DPRK on September 8-13, 1978.On September 11, the delegation was received by the DPRK President Kim Il Sung. On this occasion, the head of the Egyptian governmental delegation transmitted a friendly support message, from the Egyptian President, Anwar al-Sadat, for the supreme cause of the Korean people – the peaceful and independent reunification of the motherland. In his reply, President Kim Il Sung, after having thanked for the message, asked [the Egyptian delegation] to send a peace and friendship message, and [his wishes] for the happiness and prosperity of the Egyptian people. Then President Kim Il Sung presented the position of the DPRK toward the Egyptian government and people, expressing the “support and adhesion of the Korean government toward the activity and the foreign policy actions of president Anwar al-Sadat on the Arab-Israeli conflict.’ The [North] Korean head of state pointed out that the DPRK was closely following the evolution of events in the Middle East and that [the DPRK] ‘supports any peace initiative launched by Egypt,’ including the tripartite high-level meeting in Camp David, which he regards as ‘as new step’ in the direction of finding a peaceful resolution for the [Middle East] conflict.The DPRK, added President Kim Il Sung, will continue to support, at many levels, the position and politics of Egypt, but it cannot publicly express this for the moment, given the complex situation in Middle East, as well as the fact that the Korean government wishes to be in good relations with the other Arab countries, including those that are against the direct dialogue between Egypt and Israel. The head of the Egyptian delegation, thanked for the support expressed by President Kim Il Sung, and gave assurances that the Egyptian government would give additional attention to its relations with the DPRK, with a view to developing and expanding these relations, to the benefit of both countries and peoples. As a friendly gesture towards the DPRK, the Egyptian government decided not to send (although it initially said it would) a sports delegation at the international shooting championship, which will begin on September 24th in Seoul.SignedPaul Marinescu\n",

      "According to the information available for the Polish ambassador, the Chinese standpoint on the issue of Korean unification has undergone a change. He also discussed this with Deputy Foreign Minister Qiao Guanhua, who is of the opinion that the previous Chinese standpoint was wrong, by now China has become aware of that the South Korean situation is unsuitable for armed unification. In April the [South Korean] aggressors eliminated all [South Korean] forces which would have supported [armed unification]. In the opinion of the Poles, the current Korean standpoint on this issue is identical with the Chinese one, this is one [of the factors] which make their current relationship so close. The Koreans hope that if the Sino-American negotiations result in an American decision to make a compromise, Korea may also gain advantage. Since the DPRK is afraid of Japanese militarism, it finds it necessary to improve its relations with the Chinese and the Soviets.– 221 –\n",

      "Comrade Lahiri, the deputy head of the International Liaisons Department of the CPI [Communist Party of India], told us that he had been a member of the party delegation that recently, the first time after a period of twenty years, visited the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. The CPI attributes great importance to the normalization of its inter-party relations with the KWP, because the KWP exerts influence on the Asian and African parties, countries, and movements.The personality cult, the efforts to achieve economic autarky, the vague theory of juche, the unprincipled conceptions about the unification of Korea, and the Korean standpoint on several international issues, such as the Cambodian question, made a negative impression on the Indian party delegation. In a cautious way, they let their hosts know [what they thought about] all that.Nevertheless, the CPI will make efforts to achieve a gradual development of inter-party relations.  247 – V. \n",

STALINWe report information about the situation in Korea at the 38th parallel.After the withdrawal of our troops from North Korea violations of the regime at the 38th parallel by the “Southerners” have taken on a provocative and systematic nature. In the past month these violations have become more frequent. During the entire period from 1 January through 15 April of this year 37 violations were made along the entire 38th parallel, of which 24 were in the period from 15 March through 15 April.In their nature the violations are clashes [between] police security units, from regiment to battalion in strength, accompanied by small arms and mortar fire and a crossing of the 38th parallel by the “Southerners”. In all cases of violations the initiative of opening fire came from the “Southerners”.At the same time as the aggravation of the situation at the 38th parallel during March and April the “Southerners” brought up combat forces to the 38th parallel.For example, the 1st Infantry Brigade was moved from Seoul to the region of [KAYDZIO [(KAESONG)].According to information which needs to be verified the concentration of the troops of the “Southerners” at the 38th parallel continues.It is not excluded that new provocations against troops of the North Korean Government from the “Southerners” might take place, bringing larger forces into action than has occurred up to now. [Translator’s note: the following paragraph was highlighted in the left margin].

      "Moscow. Cde. StalinCopy: General Staff Cde. AntonovReporting on the situation on the Far Eastern front at the end of 19.8.45.1. On 19.8.45 on all fronts in Manchuria the resistance of the Japanese forces ceased and our forces began planned disarmament of the forces of the enemy. During the day of 19.8.45 about 65 thousand Japanese-Manchurian forces were disarmed. 2. During the day the forces of the Transbaikal Front deployed air troops with responsible representatives of the command of the Front to Changchun and Mukden [Shenyang], 250-300 people in each city. Our forces in the aforesaid cities were met with warm welcome on the part of the Japanese command and representatives of the Japanese authorities. All demands of our representatives are being fully implemented. During the night of 20.8.45 these cities are being approached by our forward mobile detachments. On 20.8.45 the cities of Changchun and Mukden will be fully secured by us. 3. Forces of the 1st Far Eastern Front during the day continued to disarm detachments of the 3rd and the 5th armies of the Japanese forces. During the day the front’s forces deployed air troops, with whose assistance the city of Kirin was captured. Mobile land forces will enter the city no later than 20.8.45.4. Forces of the 2nd Far Eastern Front continued, after capturing Shanxing [sic], without meeting enemy resistance, to move along both banks of Sungari [Songhua] River. The city of Harbin is still firmly occupied by our forces, landed on 18.8.45 by the first Far Eastern Front. On the island of Sakhalin from the morning of 19.8.45 the Japanese initiated the capitulation of their forces, which are located immediately in front of our Front. During the day of 19.8.45 more than three thousand Japanese soldiers and officers of the 88th infantry division capitulated here, and our forces moved 25 km to the south by the end of the day. From the evening of 19.08.45 from Sovgavan’ we transferred troops numbering 4220 people with artillery and transport with the aim of landing in the vicinity of the port of Maoka (southern part of Sakhalin) so as to speed up full occupation of the island. In our estimates, the island of Sakhalin should be fully occupied no later than the evening of 21.8.45. On the Kurile Islands dogged fighting continued and counter-attacks by the enemy on the island of Simusyu [Shumshu] were being beaten back until 19.8.45. From 19.00 on 19.8.45 fighting on this island ceased and the enemy, with the assistance of their parlamentarians, began general capitulation. From the morning of 20.8.45 we begin to land troops on the island of Paramushiru-to [Paramushir]. 5. On 19.8.45 I had a meeting with the head of the headquarters of the Kwantung Army Lieutenant General Hata. In accordance with your instructions [we] created the most favorable conditions for his reception in all respects. General Hata asked to hurry up with the questions of the occupation of the entire territory of Manchuria so that the Soviet forces could as quickly as possible take the Japanese army, and the Japanese population in Manchuria, under their protection. At the same time General Hata asked to postpone disarming of Japanese forces in remote regions of Manchuria and Korea until the arrival of our forces, in order to provide for necessary order and guarantee the safety of factories and possessions. As General Hata stated, the deterioration of relations between the Japanese and the Manchus, and also the Koreans in recent days has reached the limit. General Hata, requesting the quickest entry of our forces into Manchuria and, as a consequence, the capitulation of his army, at the same time requested appropriate attitude both to generals and officers, and the soldiers of the Japanese army on our part, and also appropriate sustenance and medical service for them. I gave our forces necessary instructions in this respect.6. General Hata finished his conversation with me with assurances that all my demands about the order of the implementation of capitulation will be immediately and precisely executed, and also expressed his hopes that this meeting will be guarantee future strong friendship between Japan and the USSR. To my request to inform the command of the Japanese forces defending the Kurile Islands about the pointlessness of their fight against the Soviet forces, which are striving to occupy these islands, general Hata promised to immediately turn to the Japanese headquarters with this question. At 17.00 on 19.9.45 general Hata flew to Changchun with my instructions where he landed at 21.00 under difficult weather conditions. 7. At the present time I and the command of the first Far Eastern front are seriously preoccupied with the preparation of the operation to land on the island of Hokkaido. Currently we are gathering maritime intelligence, preparing the air force, the artillery, infantry and means of transport. With your permission we will begin the maritime operation immediately after occupying the southern part of Sakhalin, approximately on 22.8.45. 8. On 19.8.45 the Emperor of Manchukuo “Pu Yi” and his retinue were delivered to the headquarters of Kravchenko’s army. In accordance with your instructions, I am interning him and I am thinking of placing him in the region of Chita. 9. In accordance with your instructions I gave directions to the Transbaikal Front command to prepare landing troops with the aim of sudden capture of the ports of Dairen [Dalian] and Port Arthur [Lüshun]. 20.8.45 3.00Vasilevsky\n",

The new proposals of the Chinese-Korean delegation concerning an armistice in Korea made on 3 July 1952 touch on the issue of POWs.Before the meeting which was held on 3 July the Chinese-Korean side advocated their following position in negotiations on the issue of POWs:\"We propose the adoption of the following agreement about the principles of the settlement which contains specific conditions regarding repatriation while adhering to the general principles described in our proposal of 21 March:a) All non-Korean POWs of the United Nations command and all Korean POWs whose place of residence was located in areas of your side which the Korean People's Army and the Chinese people's volunteers have  should be repatriated; all POWs who are Chinese people's volunteers of non-Korean nationality and all Korean POWs whose place of residence was in areas of our side which the United National armed forces have should be repatriated.b) All Korean POWs should be repatriated who the Korean People's Army and Chinese people's volunteers have and whose place of residence is in areas of our side and also all Korean POWs who the United Nations command has and whose place of residence is in areas of our side with the exception of those who wish to return to the place of their original residence; there is no need to repatriate the latter\".The above proposal is contained in the draft Agreement about the principle of settling the issue of the repatriation of POWs which was offered by the Chinese-Korean side at a meeting of staff officers on 27 March 1952. (TASS Far East Official Information Bulletin of 10 May 1952, pages 1-3d).On 3 July 1952 General Nam Il, the head of the Korean-Chinese delegation, made a new proposal about the issue of POWs. The main provisions of Nam Il's 3 July statement come down to the following:The main contentious issue, declared Nam Il, is the following: the results of our inspection of the lists of POWs are not in conformity with the principle about which we have agreed. We have always thought that inasmuch as both sides guarantee the non- involvement of POWs in the Korean War after repatriation in accordance with paragraph 52, the prisoners of both sides \"should just be permitted to return home to a peaceful life\". Thus, the prisoners of both sides should be reclassified and the lists of POWs verified, taking the nationality and place of residence of the prisoners into consideration. This would simplify the repatriation of all POWs, as was provide for in paragraph 51, that is, all foreign armed personnel (of the armed forces of the United Nations and the Chinese people's volunteers) taken prisoner by any side should be repatriated; all Korean armed personnel taken prisoner by any side (of the South Korean forces and the Korean People's Army) whose residence is in areas of the other side should be repatriated, but personnel whose residence is in areas of the side that took him prisoner might be permitted to return home directly and there is no need to repatriate him. (TASS Far East Official Information Bulletin of 4 July 1952, pages 17-20d).This statement was made by Nam Il in accordance with an instruction from Mao Zedong about which Cde. Razuvayev informed us in telegram Nº 2118.2. It follows from the above that from 27 March to 3 July the Chinese-Korean delegation had insisted that after the conclusion of an armistice:a) all POWs of Korean nationality should be repatriated;b) Korean POWs whose place of residence is on the territory of the opposing side should be returned to their place of residence;c) Korean POWs whose place of residence is on the territory of the side that took them prisoner should be left on that territory if they wish it.On 3 July the Chinese-Korean delegation offered a proposal so that Korean POWs would be returned to their place of residence regardless of their wishes.The position of the Chinese-Korean delegation with regard to the POWs of non-Korean nationality remained as before.Thus, the new proposal of the Chinese-Korean delegation affects only Korean POWs and intends that Korean POWs should be returned to enemy territory if their place of residence is there but that all Korean POWs who lived on the territory of the side which took them prisoner before mobilization should be left on that territory, released, and sent home.[signed] A.

Nº 418Today the Americans introduced an underhanded amendment to our proposal about inviting the Koreans to take part in the discussions of the Korean issue. You have received the text in the clear.Therefore under the guise of providing an amendment to our proposal, they are trying to push through right away, without discussing the substance of the issue, a decision about the provisional commission which is the core element of their draft resolution on Korea. We have objected to this amendment and will press for removing it, and in case of voting, will vote against it and against the resolution about inviting the Koreans as a whole if the amendment is not removed. Furthermore, we will make a statement on the reasons behind our vote pointing out that the American amendment is not compatible with the proposal of the Soviet delegation and has as its goal circumventing our proposal and reducing it to nothing. A number of delegates (Australia, China and others) expressed their support of the American amendment. Apparently, on 30 October this amendment will be put to vote in the first half of the day.

      "([Yanhuang chunqiu] Editor’s Comment: This essay is the posthumous work of Comrade Wu Zhili, former director of the Chinese People’s Volunteer Army Health Division. With the exception of a few sentences and obvious typographical errors, this journal did not permit alterations in order to not influence the understanding of its contents.)It has already been 44 years (in 1997) since the armistice of the Korean War, but as for the worldwide sensation of 1952: how indisputable is the bacteriological war of the American imperialists?The case is one of false alarm.That year the Party Central Committee confirmed (at least at the beginning) that it believed that the U.S. Army was conducting bacteriological warfare. We mobilized the whole military and the whole nation, spending large amounts of manpower and materiel to carry out an anti-bacteriological warfare movement. At the same time, American imperialism was also notoriously reaching a low point. When the former commander of U.S. Forces in Korea, [Matthew Bunker] Ridgeway, was transferred to Allied Headquarters Europe at the end of 1952, crowds jeered him at his arrival to the airport, calling him “the god of pestilence”[1] and causing him embarrassment. Not until he swore by the name of God that the U.S. military did not undertake bacteriological warfare was he allowed to go.The affair originated with the appearance of large numbers of flies[2] and fleas on the snowy winter ground. It was later learned that these were snow fleas (in Korean called ‘oguli’), not human fleas,[3] and that they are a natural phenomenon on the snow in the winter. Snow fleas are of the order Springtail (Collembola), genus Dark springtail (Isotomapalustris[4]). I also had reports of snow fleas in Northeast China. At that time we thought flies and fleas could not be found on the snow, and given that foreign newspapers were reporting that Japanese bacteriological war criminal Ishii [Shiro] had come to the front lines in Korea to investigate suspicious deaths on the U.S. military side, the Central Committee determined that the U.S. military was conducting bacteriological warfare.The principal course of the affair was as follows: On January 29, 1952, the [Chinese People’s] Volunteer Army Health Division and Volunteer Army Headquarters received a telegram from the 42nd Army claiming that U.S. planes flew over Pyonggang county (where that army was encamped) on January 28, 1952, and on the snow-covered ground in the trenches many types of insects were discovered. Among them were fleas, flies,[5] and spider-like insects. The 42nd Army sent specimens of 23 fleas (snow fleas), 33 flies,[6] and spider-like insects. Our chemical testing lab conducted cultures and did not discover pathogenic bacteria. The head of the 42nd Army Health Division was Gao Liang, a very attentive and qualified health cadre who had been the head of education at the medical school when I was in the 3rd Division. He must have been somewhat on alert about bacteriological warfare in order to send this telegram. The 42nd Army’s telegram was also sent to PVA Command, where it drew the a high degree of attention from Commander Peng Dehuai, was forwarded to the Party Central Committee, and was sent to every unit to alert them and require timely reports of any similar situations. At that time almost all units sent telegrams of similar discoveries (within two months there were close to a thousand reports), reporting that the enemy dropped all kinds of things, including dead rats, flies and large mosquitos, vessels with insects (which were U.S. Army iron 4-compartment ammunition cases and paper parachute tubes used for spreading propaganda material), tree leaves and snakes, and one or two units reported that some North Korean citizens had suddenly died. [There were also] reports that large amounts of dead fish floated up in the river, and ten or more specimens of small dead fish (crucian carp[7]) were sent in, which a bacteriological culture found to have pure salmonella. People’s Daily again reported that U.S. planes were dropping bacteria, dead rats and other things. Coincidentally, at that time suspicious deaths were discovered on the U.S. military front lines, and the U.S. military sent Japanese bacteriological war criminal and former head of Unit 731 Ishii to North Korea to investigate this matter and publish this information. Based on the above information, the Party Central Committee determined that the U.S. military was conducting bacteriological warfare. After just a few days, on February 22, 1952, the front page of the People’s Daily ran an eye-grabbing top headline, which, in the name of the Chinese People’s Volunteer Army and the North Korean government, denounced the U.S. imperialists for carrying out large-scale bacteriological war in Korea and Northeast China. Photographs of the dropped objects and bacterial smears were attached. This drew jarring and successive condemnation from the whole world. Prior to this, we did not know People’s Daily would publish so quickly. After publication, I said to Health Division Deputy Director Zhu Zhiguang (since passed): “From here on, we should be passive.” Zhu said, “After today, we can only write an article.”[8]The Central Health Division[9] was under the charge of Deputy Director He Cheng. He had worked in Northeast China, and knew that Japan’s Unit 731 had engaged in[10] bacteriological warfare. He knew Ishii’s person and deeds, and that they were his mistaken decision- and the Party Central Committee agreed. He sent entomologist Professor He Qi and bacteriologist Professor Wei Xi (both of them since passed) to Korea to investigate. Before they came, we had already dispatched men (including myself) to the reporting units many times to ascertain the situation, an investigation which concluded that there were insects and other objects dropped on the snow, but which did not discover people who had died suddenly or suspiciously fallen ill. Units that had previously reported deaths said that the reports had been hearsay. As for flies, almost every house has them in front of and behind the stove—they could fly out the door onto the snow at any time. My personal analysis was: (1) Imperialism is capable of carrying out all manner of evils, and bacteriological war is not an exception. (2) Severe winter, however, is not a good season for conducting bacteriological war. When the weather is cold the mobility of insects is weakened, and is not conducive to bacteria reproduction. (3) Dropping [objects] on the front line trenches, where there are few people and sickness does not spread easily, and where the U.S. military’s trenches are not more than ten meters away, allows for the possibility of ricocheting. (4) Korea already had an epidemic of lice-borne contagious diseases. All the houses in the cities and towns had been burned down, and the common people all lived in air-raid shelters. Their lives are already difficult, but the Korean people are extremely tenacious and bacteriological warfare cannot be the greater disaster that forces them to surrender. (5) Our preliminary investigation still could not prove that the U.S. military carried out bacteriological warfare. I reported my viewpoint to Deputy Commander Hong, and he agreed that I should send a report of my opinion to Commander Peng and the Central Committee. I suggested that it would be wise to not publicize this as a major matter, in order to avoid being passive and wasting manpower and resources (this was before Professors He and Wei had arrived). Just then, a telegram arrived from the Central Committee, criticizing my lack of vigilance and saying that the enemy had not carried out bacteriological warfare, but that we could still take advantage of this to reinforce health work. Afterward Professors He and Wei carried on with their investigations and observed insect specimens and bacterial smears. He discovered that the so-called fleas were snow fleas, while Wei discovered that although the stained snow flea smears seemed to have bubonic plague[11] bacteria, they showed to be gram-positive (bubonic plague is gram-negative). They could not culture plague. I asked their opinion. He Qi said (verbatim), “I think it’s a false alarm.”[12] After Commander Peng saw my telegram, he requested that I give an in-person report. Deputy Commander Hong asked me to give Commander Peng a realistic account of my viewpoint. Coincidentally, Chief Kim of the Korean People’s Army Disease Prevention Bureau was ordered to come get to the bottom of things and discuss with me how to manage the situation, because they also could not come up with evidence. I took him with me to see Commander Peng, hoping that Kim could be a witness to the fact that evidence of bacteriological warfare could not be found. That evening, we arrived at the PVA Headquarters in Hoechang County (We were posted at Seongcheon County, about a two-hour drive from the Command). Commander Peng, Deputy Commanders Deng Hua and Song Shilun, and ten or more others were sitting. We reported the results of our investigation and our opinions as stated above. Commander Peng said sternly (this is the general idea): “Our Health Director is an America imperialist operative and speaks on behalf of the enemy. Can the health of the Volunteer Army be guaranteed?” Then he said, “There are others who report that you[13] are neglecting the sick and wounded. If a thousand or ten thousand die on the battlefield that’s fine, but if one dies afterwards I will come to you for a reckoning.” I said, “I will no longer act as Health Director. I have no other request, except please let me stay in Korea and fight.” Commander Peng declared the meeting temporarily in recess for the standing committee to deliberate. When the meeting resumed, Commander Peng said, “The standing committee still wants you as the Health Director. Do a proper job. Set up a general disease prevention office and be the deputy director. Deng Hua will be the director.” On the road later with Director Kim, he said that he was scared and trembling because he thought I’d be beheaded. He also said, “Your Commander Peng is great, he loves the troops! He both educates you and regards you highly. You have a good Party, and a good Commander. After returning to post, I reported everything to Deputy Commander Hong, including what Commander Peng said to me personally. Hong did not utter a word, except to say “Do a proper job!” After only a few days, the Director of the Northeast Military Region Health Division, Dai Zhenghua (since passed), was tasked by the Central Military Commission to investigate anti-bacteriological warfare work. I gave him a report of Commander Peng’s instructions. Dai said, “Don’t be afraid, just go do what Commander Peng said.” That night at midnight, I received a phone call from the Soviet Chief of Staff at Headquarters who, through a translator, said, “Stalin has asked whether bacteriological warfare is really occurring.” I answered, “Go ask Commander Peng,” and hung up the phone. I thought to myself, this is really hard to figure out! If I don’t do this right I’ll be beheaded. I should prepare myself to be beheaded.After only a few days, He Cheng and Gong Rengquan organized a disease prevention inspection unit with a 30-person strong line-up that included He Qi and Wei Xi and had it come to Korea to aid in countering bacteriological warfare. Among them were:Entomologist He QiFlea expert Liao ZhiyingParasite experts Wu Guang and Bao DingchengBacteriologists Wei Xi, Chen Wengui (a plague expert who proved that Japan used the plague during the War of Resistance), Fang Liang (Korean), Xie Zhimu, Guo Shiqin, and Cheng ZhiyiVirologist Guo ChengzhouEpidemiology experts He Guanqing and Yu HuanwenExpert in Rickettsia corpuscles Liu Weitong (who is also an epidemiology expert)Approximately 10 young scientists (Ren Minfeng, Wu Zilin, Hu Jietang, Li Yimin, Li Zhenqiong, Gao Yundiao, Liu Yujing, etc.)10 or more photographers and techniciansI divided them into 4 teams, the largest of which I placed near the Health Division. I placed the other 3 teams in the health departments of the Eastern, Central, and Western fronts respectively. These 3 teams were to take charge of the preliminary examination of specimens sent up from the field, and were responsible for directing disease prevention work on the ground. Specimens that had problems in the preliminary examination would be sent to the group headquarters at Seongcheon for a secondary examination. The number of specimens received was large (several hundred), and some had bacteria cultured from them. All of these were Salmonella-type, and neither plague[14] nor cholera[15] appeared. A few times anthrax[16] was found on tree leaf specimens. There were all kinds of so-called “dropped objects,” but it was difficult to link them to bacteriological warfare.I quickly formulated anti-bacteriological warfare measures (strengthening individual health measures, giving more types of vaccinations, requiring everyone to pin their trouser leg and sleeve openings tight and wear scarves around the neck, setting sentries to watch the sky, developing methods for collecting and submitting specimens for examination, on-the-spot swatting of insects dropped from the air, sprinkling sanitizer, discovering suspiciously ill personnel first isolate them and then report, etc.) and promulgated them throughout the whole army. I also got Commander Peng’s approval (which the PAV Headquarters and allied governments circulated to the whole army) to perform autopsies on the dead, giving a green light to researching the cause of their injury and death.For the entire year, no sick patient or deceased person was found to have anything to do with bacteriological warfare. Because of our particular focus on health, the number of sick personnel was greatly reduced. Later, in 1987, a few army leader cadres ran into me and said, “The American imperialists engaged in such massive germ warfare but our side didn’t even have one death!” By then, I thought this was unimaginable.That year [1952] we were busy with receiving investigatory delegations: Li Dequan [Otto Braun, Comintern advisor to the Chinese Communist Party] and Liao Chengzhi led the Chinese team, the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, and the International Scientific Commission. The head of the latter delegation was Royal Society fellow Joseph Needham, who wrote Science and Civilisation in China.[17] The deputy head of the delegation was U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences fellow Zhukov-Verezhnikov, who was experienced in this area and was a medical expert at the trial of Japanese bacteriological war criminals in Khabarovsk. He brought a young English translator named Mr. Kowalski.[18] Members of the delegation included Brazilian biologist and bat expert Dr. [Samuel B.] Pessoa, French veterinary expert Professor [Jean] Malterre, Swedish clinical laboratory scientist Dr. Andrea Andreen (female), and Italian biologist Dr. [Oliviero] Olivo. Our own Dr. Qian Sanqiang was the point-of-contact, Doctor Chen Shu was the Russian translator, tropical disease expert Dr. Zhong Huilan and (gynecology) professor Yan Renying (female) were English translators. Of the former two investigation teams, one was entirely Chinese and of course fully cooperated. The International Association of Democratic Lawyers, not being natural scientists, diligently noted down everything we said, all the while cursing American imperialism. It was not the same with the International Scientific Commission: although they believed that the American imperialists conducted bacteriological warfare, we could not produce proof of the issue. Soviet Academician Zhukov was entrusted [with the task] by Stalin. He was an all-right fellow. When they came to Korea, which was right after the U.S. military conducted a huge bombing raid on Pyongyang, Pyongyang was a field of rubble. The investigation teams first inspected the bacterial evidence dropped by American planes in the Northeast [of China] (July 12 to July 25). Before entering Korea, Zhukov had said to them, “Korea is a battlefield and very dangerous, we might as well make a conclusion about the results of the Northeast investigation and sign it in order to avoid working hard and accomplishing nothing [if we get killed].” The other delegates thought this made sense, and wrote the initial conclusion that the U.S. military had conducted bacteriological warfare in Northeast China. In Korea (July 28 to August 1), they were set up in a hotel deep underground, but were still harassed by American planes at night. On the day the hearing began, the Korean side reported two cases. One was of cholera deaths: American planes dropped straw baskets on Daedong in Pyongyang, which contained mussels carrying cholera. Patients ate the mussels, got cholera, and died. Korea had not had cholera in many years. The other case was of plague deaths: one day a family discovered fleas on the surface of their water jar, which was very strange. After a few days, members of the family fell ill and died. The autopsy revealed plague. Korea had never before had plague. (This case was prepared under the guidance of Professor Chen Wengui at the request of the Korean side, it was similar to what he observed in water jars in the 1940s when Japan dropped disease-carrying fleas at Changde). The Volunteer Army brought forward the case of two first lieutenants at the 20th Group encampment who discovered a dense group of fleas while chopping wood. They collected quite a few and sent them in. Plague was cultured from the fleas. Because we required everyone to tighten their trouser leg and sleeve openings and immediately sanitize areas upon which objects had been dropped from the sky while we were countering anti-bacteriological warfare, the army did not have any sick or dead. The scientists easily accepted this, and they adopted the testimony. The truth of this matter is that the fleas were discovered in small thatched cottages in the forest. These cottages have firewood and other assorted items in them that are suitable for flea colonies. It is difficult to say that the American imperialists dropped these in. When they were giving the above report, they did not mention the thatched cottages. This time when they were asked to go out and testify at the scene, one of them said that Chairman Mao taught him not to lie. He was unable to move. What to do? Only to persuade him to submit to the current needs of the struggle against the enemy and say that the place where fleas were discovered was out in the open. All the flea specimens were human fleas (Pulexirritans[19]). As for the plague, that was easy, we [could] cause it to appear.About the middle of May, Chen Wengui phoned me from our inspection team’s bacteria lab to tell me that Fang Liang had lost the plague cultures dropped by the enemy (the bacteria lab was originally Fang Liang’s responsibility, in reality the lab had never had plague cultures). Chen Wengui had studied plague with an Indian professor,[20] and discovered it at once. I realized that this was a big problem and immediately notified Director He Cheng in Beijing and Director Wang Bin in Northeast China to promptly send Comrade Men Xin to get the plague cultures or else this would all be [too] difficult to manage. Men Xin (who later served as the director of Military Hospital 203 in Liaoyang, since retired) went to Shenyang, and came back in 5 days with two tubes of plague cultures (packed in sealed iron pipes). I gave one tube to Chen Wengui, and gave the other to the North Korean deputy prime minister of health protection Ro Jin-han[21] in the presence of the deputy captain of our disease prevention unit Li Zhefan. He had asked for the bacteria cultures before, and at this moment he knew exactly why I gave him the cultures. After this, I told Li Zhefan, “In case it will be difficult when the time comes to prove bacteriological warfare, inject me with plague and let me die. This way, the director of the Health Division will have caught the plague dropped by the U.S. military even if it is not iron-clad evidence.” He said, “That won’t do. We can always think of another way.” It was apparent how large the pressure was at this time. Li was of Korean ethnicity.[22] Before Liberation he had done plague prevention work with Soviet experts in Northeast China and was already a remarkable expert. A few years ago I asked him if he remembered this affair, and he said he did not remember it too clearly.Within this one year I went to Beijing three times to report on issues related to anti-bacteriological warfare. I saw Premier Zhou [Enlai] every time. Even though Premier Zhou had many matters to attend to, he asked a lot of very detailed questions about this issue. One time, the Korean Deputy Prime Minister for Health Protection went with me to Beijing and gave the Premier a report of the preparatory work of the International Scientific Investigation Team. The Premier asked the Korean side what difficulties there were, and I interjected, after which the Premier immediately asked Deputy Prime Minister Ro what he thought of my opinion. It moved me that the Premier had the noble character to respect the opinions of others, and at the same time made me feel like I should not so wantonly interrupt. One evening, at a little past 8 o’clock, the Premier was eating while discussing issues with me. He only had a small bowl of rice, two small plates of vegetables and a small bowl of soup. Quite a thrifty life.Before the investigation teams returned to Northeast China, they went to Pyoktong prisoner of war camp on the northern border of Korea and met with several U.S. airmen. They had earlier published in People’s Daily that they had dropped bacteriological bombs. With the investigation teams, they freely discussed the classes they took on bacteriological weapons and their experience with “bombs that don’t explode.” After the ceasefire, they were exchanged back to their country. I heard that they were all disciplined for this. I really admire the persuasion work of our personnel in the prisoner-of-war camps.When the investigation teams returned to Beijing, they signed and published a 500-page-thick black book, Report of the International Scientific Commission for the Investigation of the Facts Concerning Bacterial Warfare in Korea and China. They were received by Chairman Mao.After the international scientists gave their report to Chairman Mao, he said, “I see that the American imperialists are experimentally engaged in bacteriological warfare.” They unanimously approved what he said.[23]After Academician Zhukov returned to the Soviet Union and reported to Stalin, a telegram came from the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party saying that bacteriological warfare was a false alarm. Premier Zhou immediately sought out Chief of Staff Huang Kecheng and Deputy Commander Hong Xuezhi and asked, “Have you been up to tricks?” Hong answered, “Yes, otherwise we wouldn’t have had anything to report.” At that time, China had sent people to Europe to do anti-bacteriological warfare propaganda. Premier Zhou promptly ordered a retraction. Afterwards China did not raise the matter again, but following [generations] did not know. A few people who write books are always inserting that the American imperialists engaged in bacteriological warfare. I always recommend conveying that we were “threatened” by bacteriological warfare, thus taking a more defensible position. When he was sick, Huang Kecheng asked me to pass his opinion to the comrades at the Academy of Military Sciences who were editing an encyclopedia: “The American imperialists did not engage in bacteriological warfare in Korea. Right now the two countries’ relationship is not bad, and it would be inappropriate to keep talking about this issue.” When they heard this, they sent someone to ask if there had been bacteriological warfare after all. I only said that we do not have enough evidence. This has been my silent regret for decades. There has been no other. I only feel sorry for the international scientists who signed their names. Perhaps I am too naïve, because it is possible they knew the truth but obeyed the requirements of the political struggle. If it was like this then fine, but if not then they were deceived by me. I had unceasingly expressed my apology for them to Huang Kecheng. Huang said, “You don’t need to feel this way, this was political struggle! Furthermore you had expressed your views on bacteriological warfare from the beginning. It was not an easy situation, and you were given responsibility too late.” I think that there will be a day in history to speak clearly about this incident. Now that I am an 83-year-old man who knows the facts and is no longer on duty, it is fitting to speak out: the bacteriological war of 1952 was a false alarm.September 1997(Retrospective from February 2, 2005: Last year, in 2004, Professor Li Yimin at the Military Hospital Academy of Science forwarded an essay written by a professor at a Belgian medical college, discussing this affair in particular, which said: “Russia has published documents from the former Soviet Union. In the fall of 1952, the Soviet Central Party Committee sent telegrams to Chairman Mao Zedong and Chairman Kim Il Sung respectively, claiming that the U.S. military had certainly not conducted bacteriological warfare and that it was a false alarm. The Academy membership of Soviet expert Zhukov has been revoked because he took the lead on producing the black book.”)(The author [Wu Zhili] is the former Director of the Chinese People’s Volunteer Army Health Division)([Yanhuang chunqiu] Editor: Huang Zhong)[1]The Chinese word used, wenshen [瘟神], is a deity traditionally believed in Korea and China to cause disease and pestilence. The fact that European crowds were using the name of a Chinese deity in this case may be embellishment by the author.[2] More specifically, “houseflies.”[3] The Chinese term is generally used to refer to the Pulex irritans. The original article uses the common names for organisms, except in a few cases where the scientific name is given parenthetically after the common name in the text.

      "Information regarding: New developments concerning the unification of Korea and relations between the DPRK and South Korea, August 16, 1972For official use!InformationThe 38th parallel, determined by the world powers as a temporary dividing line of the military activities of the Soviet and American troops, with the goal of accepting the surrender of the 200,000 Japanese army in Korea, after World War II, and especially after the three-year Korean War (1950-1953), turned, in fact, into a border between two countries with different societal and political structures, created on the territory of the country in 1948, [countries] which did not recognize each other, and both laying claim to represent the entire Korean population—the DPRK and the Korean Republic, whose governments had placed, and continued to place the issue of reuniting the country as a main task of their internal and foreign political activities.The position of the South Korean government, declared repeatedly and not changed in the course of almost 20 years, boils down to “reuniting through holding common elections throughout the whole country under the observation of the United Nations.”The proposals of the DPRK government are diametrically opposed to this position. Their essence is the focus on the solving of the Korean issue “without foreign intervention, independently, on peaceful democratic ground” and “the formation of a united central democratic government through holding of free common elections in the southern and northern parts of the country,” after the withdrawal of all foreign armies from South Korean territory.Standing on fundamentally different poles, after the three-year Korean war between the DPRK and South Korea, all contacts and connection were cut off, and their official positions on the issue of reuniting the country had more of a propagandistic goal, as opposed to tangible value and were mostly aimed at the countries, aiding one or the other side in the examining of the Korean issue in the UN.  During the 60s, the governments of the North and South brought forward an unofficial plan, unachievable in practical terms, towards preparations for the reuniting of the country through military force. The term “in a peaceful way and through democratic means” was deprived of all substance and was used solely as a propagandistic slogan.The South Korean administration called for a “march toward the North” and “a reuniting through victory over communism,” and in the DPRK one could not “think about a peaceful reuniting with the presence of the aggressive troops of the American imperialism in South Korea and today’s puppets.”/Kim Il Sung—report of the CC of the KWP at the 5th Congress of the KWP. /The main efforts in both parts were aimed at the modernization of the military and the building of solid defense systems, eating up the greater part of the annual budgets of both governments, raising the combative and moral spirit of the soldiers and officers, and the training and arming of “the whole population.”These mutually irreconcilable policies were accompanied by constant incidents along the line of demarcation, the sending of individuals and groups with the goal of spying, and the constant sustaining of tension on the Korean peninsula.The past year, 1971, was characterized by certain changes and the appearance of new moments in their positions on the issue of reuniting the country and their mutual relations. Without ceasing their hostile policies, in different statements of officials from the North and the South, a readiness was expressed for establishing direct contacts, organizing meetings and carrying conversations. Of course, these statements in the preliminary stages contained many prerequisites, which at the beginning of the present year formed into two main [ones]:- The South Korean government to renounce “its orientation towards foreign powers” for the reunification, and- The DPRK government – “from its plans of achieving reunification through military force.”The international setting which has changed and the general tendency for reducing tensions in the whole world, the disapproval on the side of the USSR and other socialist countries, including China, finding itself in the process of improving relations with the USA, of the policies for reunification of Korea through military force, and also the presence of American troops in South Korea, compelled the DPRK government to abandon, albeit for the moment, its policy of military adventurism and to raise again as a primary plan the peaceful and democratic way for the reunification of the country, which was embedded in the foundation of the policies of the “peaceful advance,” conducted by the DPRK’s government during the present year. While in the proclamation of the Supreme People’s Council of the DPRK to the people of South Korea on April 13, 1971, expressing in 8 points the official position of the government of the DPRK on the issue of the reunification of the country, it is underlined that “we are ready to resolve peacefully the issue of reunifying the country through negotiations between the North and the South, in the event that after the removal of Park Chung Hee’s puppet faction in South Korea, a real people’s rule is established, or a patriotic democratic figure comes to power,” already in Kim Il Sung’s speech on August 6th there is talk of readiness for negotiations, including with Park Chung Hee’s ruling Democratic Republican Party.These changes were confirmed by him during the interview with the chief editor of the Japanese newspaper “Asahi Simbun,” in which it was expressed the DPRK’s readiness also to conduct a political meeting of the parties for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and for the simultaneous annulment of the agreements of the DPRK with the USSR and the PRC and of South Korea with the USA and Japan, in regard of removing them as a hindrance on the path to reunification.In answer to the questions of the correspondents from the newspaper “Yomiuri Simbun” on January 10 this year, Kim Il Sung proposed the transformation of “the truce agreement in Korea into a peace treaty between the North and the South,” which in fact established the beginning of the policies of “the peaceful advancement” for the reuniting of Korea. Later during the talks that Kim Il Sung had with correspondents from the newspaper “the New York Times” on May 26, it was pointed out that “the differences between the North and the South should not be an obstacle in the realization of national union and the reuniting of the native land.”Of course, the return to the peaceful way of reuniting the country can be qualified as a tactic move of the DPRK’s government, with which it also aims to convince the USA and the South Korean government of the unsoundness of the fears about “aggression of the North towards the South” so that it might contribute to the hastening of the withdrawal of American troops while waiting for a more suitable time, when the process of carrying out the reunification would not cause international complications.The changes in the South Korean government position can also be considered tactical.Facing the “impregnable fortress” and the “armed people” of the DPRK on one side and the “danger” from the withdrawal of the American troops and the cutting off of the American military aid—on the other, the South Korean government was basically forced to find ways of reducing the tension between the two parts, which would give it time and opportunities to finish the process of modernizing the South Korean army, which had fallen behind in comparison with the DPRK—and which was necessary for the maintaining of the military balance on the Korean peninsula after the withdrawal of the American troops from South Korea. It was forced to make some contacts with the North and to accept, even though just for appearances for now, the “principle of independence” for the reuniting of the country.At the same time, though, with the goal of straightening the internal regime, at the end of the last year, 1971, a state of national emergency was announced in South Korea, and “a law for emergency measures for the defense of the country” was passed, which gave unlimited powers and opportunities to Park Chung Hee to deal with his inside adversaries and to hold centralized, under his direct watch and leadership, talks with the government and the representatives of the DPRK.The first contacts between the North and the South were established through the Red Cross organizations during the second half of 1971.As the South Korean telegraph agencies report, at a press-conference on August 12, 1971, the president of the Red Cross organization of South Korea, Choe Du-seon, proposed a meeting of representatives from the organizations of the Red Cross in the North and South so that “the Korean families which have been separated for the last 20 years” can be helped.The government of South Korea immediately expressed its full support of the proposal, and “two days later—so did the DPRK.”After 5 meetings of messengers for mutual exchange of letters, on September 20, 1971 in Panmunjeom, the first round of preliminary negotiations was started.Right at the very beginning of the conversations between the five-member delegations of the two organizations, the place for the main negotiations was agreed on—alternating between Pyongyang and Seoul. The installation of two direct telephone lines between the two points in Panmunjeom was also agreed upon.After 19 preliminary meetings the principle agreement of the two parties concerning the agenda of the main negotiations was reached, and was presented to a group of experts for finalizing.With the conclusion of the experts’ work, which took place behind closed doors, on the 20th round of preliminary talks, the daily agenda of the main negotiations was decided on, which included the following issues:1. Tracing the addresses and clarifying the fate of the separated members of the families and relatives, and letting them know of this.2. Establishing a free mutual visit and a free meeting of the families and relatives.3. Establishment of a free correspondence between the separated members of the families and the relatives.4. Bringing together the separated families by their own free will and desire.5. Other issues subject to a humanitarian solution.At the 23rd round of the negotiations the date of the opening of the main negotiations was agreed on—August 5th this year, and the make up of the two delegations and the accompanying experts were also agreed on. It was decided that the two delegations would be made up of 7 members, headed by the leaders of the organizations of the Red Cross of the two countries or by one of their deputies and [there would be] 70 experts.At the moment when the conclusion of the preliminary talks was expected, during the 24th round, the DPRK delegation came out with an additional proposal for the invitation and participation during the first two meetings—in Pyongyang and in Seoul, of representatives of the political parties and the public organizations of the North and South, which was met with reserve by the South Korean delegation. [The proposal] made impossible the opening of the negotiations on the already agreed on date—August 5th, and it was used to pressure the South Korean delegation for the specifications of the place of the first meeting.The two unsettled issues, along with others, subject to specification, were put forward again for review by a group of experts, who after a couple of meetings were able to achieve a certain amount of agreement, stated in the 25th round of the preliminary negotiations on August 11th this year. It was announced that the first meeting of the main negotiations would take place on August 30th this year in Pyongyang, and the second—in Seoul on September 13th.In the DPRK as well as in South Korea, the negotiations between representatives of the Red Cross organizations are considered as a first step on the road to reuniting the country.The second step towards this goal was unexpected to the world public, as well as to the Korean people.On July 4th this year at 10 o’clock in the morning at press conferences in Pyongyang and Seoul, as well as in the press and on the radio stations in North and South Korea, a “North-South Joint Communiqué” was announced, the result of visits to the DPRK (2-5 May 1972) of the head of the South Korean CIA, Lee Hu-rak and his conversations with Kim Yeong-ju [Kim Yong Ju] and Kim Il Sung and the visit of Pak Seong-cheol [Pak Song Chol] to Seoul (29 May-1 June 1972) and his conversations with Lee Hu-rak and Park Chung Hee.The first point of the agreement determines the three main principles based on which the reunification of the country will be realized, namely:1. “independently, without the support of foreign powers, without interference from the outside;”2. “in a peaceful way without the use of armed forces” and3. “regardless of differences in the ideology, the ideals, and the system.”In the DPRK the authorship of the above “three principles” is ascribed to Kim Il Sung, who, according to the bulletin of the CC of the Red Cross organization in the DPRK on July 20th this year, “feels a pain in his soul more than anyone, because of the tragic circumstances of the divided country.”In South Korea, the propaganda qualifies the Joint Proclamation as a result of Park Chung Hee’s “efforts” and policies for a “peaceful and independent reunification” of Korea.Without a doubt though, is the fact that the elaboration and agreement of the above “principles” are a result of the policies implemented by the governments of the two parts, identical in form, particularly with a heavily nationalistic character, and the concessions and acceptance of the mutual conditions: “the independent principle”—by the South and the “peaceful path”—by the North.The shared nationalistic features were also underlined by Kim Il Sung in his talk with correspondents from the American newspaper “The New York Times” Harrison Salzbury and John Lee on May 26th this year. He stated that “lately the South Korean leaders, although only in word, talk about “self-initiative,” “independence” and “self-defense” and about the desire for the independent reuniting of the country. If this is looked at positively, it can be said that it has something in common with our ideas about independence, self-dependence, and self-defense.”In reality, in both the DPRK and South Korea an active ideological brainwashing of the population is carried out in the spirit of “Juche”/self-dependence, independence and self-defense/, against submission to foreign influence. These nationalistic traits, in practice, have a very controversial character. They are placated when the “ingenuity and greatness” of Kim Il Sung and Park Chung Hee is being proved, accordingly in North and South Korea, and are completely forgotten when receiving political, military, economic, and other aid from third countries is an issue.This is confirmed, as well, by the third principle—the achievement of the great national consolidation, “independently from the differences in the ideology, the ideals, and the system,” or as it is underlined in South Korea, on the basis of “the national Juche ideology,” which in fact replaces the class principle with the “national” and foresees joint existence in the ideology.In the following six separate points of the agreement are included the issues agreed on between the two countries:-- “not to offend or attack one another;”-- “to restrain themselves from armed provocations;”-- “to undertake active measures for the prevention of sudden violent outbreaks;”-- “organizing of a multilateral exchange in different areas;”-- “to collaborate for the Joint Proclamation and the realization of the independent peaceful reuniting;”-- “to support and contribute to the faster, successful conclusion of the negotiations of the Red Cross;”-- “to establish a direct telephone line between Pyongyang and Seoul;”-- “to form a ‘Committee for regulation’ on the question between the North and the South,” and others.Both countries began the fulfillment of the promises taken up through the joint agreement—mainly technical, on the day after it was published.In the press and on the radio the two countries stopped hurling abuses at Park Chung Hee and Kim Il Sung. Announcements have not appeared concerning armed incidences and breakings of the dividing line.According to a South Korean radio in Seoul, while still negotiating, an agreement was signed for the establishment of a direct telephone line between the work cabinets of Kim Yeong-ju and Lee Hu-rak, which can be used only by them or by three people designated by them, everyday, except on Saturdays and Sundays and holidays.But there have not yet been seen any real changes in the internal political activities of the two governments in the spirit of the “principles” of the Joint Proclamation, which puts under suspicion their actual value.The announcement of the mutual visits and the fact of the signing of the agreement were a surprise for the South Korean people as much as for the diplomatic circles in Pyongyang. Already the next day after its announcement though, the newspapers, the radio, and the television shows were full of messages about “the huge interest of the people from the North and South” for its complete approval. The optimism of the Korean people regarding the issue of reuniting the country was also expressed repeatedly by the representatives of the Korean public at their meetings with representatives from different countries.According to the South Korean agencies, the agreement between the North and the South was met by the South Korean people with great “excitement” as “a sensational piece of news,” with great interest.The reaction of the oppositionist New Democratic Party was and still is somewhat different, seeing in the Joint Proclamation “a certain amount of danger” for “the isolation of South Korea” and insisting with the South Korean government for “inside reforms” and “the change of all laws on the  basis of the principles of reunification,” “revoking the state of national emergency, and reducing the tension on the Korean peninsula with the help of the USA, Japan the Soviet Union, and China, which would provide the opportunity for “consolidating the power of the country and achieving the reunification independently, through a peaceful way and on democratic principles on the basis of the South Korean social system.” The changes which have taken place in the relations between the North and the South found a reaction among the world public as well.The press of the fraternal socialist countries reflected the Agreement and the press conferences of Pak Seong-cheol and Lee Hu-rak held in Pyongyang and Seoul in broad announcements, without taking a specific stance on the agreement.The Romanian leaders sent a telegram to Kim Il Sung and Choe Yong-geon [Choe Yong Gon], in which they expressed full support of the agreement. George Marshe also sent a telegram to Kim Il Sung.The reaction of China was the strongest where the press, together with detailed information, published a lot of its own material—articles and commentaries supporting the agreement.The Joint Proclamation is met with a certain amount of reserve and restraint by the representatives of the GDR and the DRV embassies. The German and Vietnamese comrades see in it elements that are contradictory to the principles of the policies carried out by them concerning relations with the GDR and South Vietnam.The reaction of the capitalist countries is also different.The governments of the USA, England and other western countries welcome the agreement and again express their support for the South Korean government.The Japanese government acted in a more reserved manner.In spite of the signed Joint Proclamation, the DPRK and South Korean governments continue to express their two different approaches towards review of the Korean issue in the United Nations.The DPRK insists on the review of the Korean issue at the 27th session of the UN, stemming from the desire for a discussion of the questions concerning the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the South Korean territory and the dismissing of the UN Commission on Korea statement of obligation by the rest of the countries for non-interference in the internal affairs of the Korean people in the process of reuniting Korea and accepting according resolutions.This position of the DPRK’s government is dictated most of all by its desire for complete change of the interpretation of the Korean issue, from one connected directly to international security, to an issue of purely internal national character whose resolution has to be fulfilled by the Korean people themselves without any foreign intervention. The South Korean government, on its part, “conducts policies directed towards not allowing the Korean issue to be included in the daily agenda of the 27th session of the UN, considering that “discussing the Korean issue will… escalate the argument around Korea and cause negative impact on the development of the negotiations between the South and North.”The South Korean government builds its position based on its fear of the possible acceptance of a resolution at the UN session that requires the dismissal of the UN Commission for the Reunification and the Restoration of Korea, and the withdrawal of the American troops from South Korea. In confirmation of such a conclusion are the efforts of the South Korean administration to ensure the continued long term presence of American troops in South Korea which is also proof of its formal attitude toward the “principle” for reuniting Korea “independently, without foreign intervention” imbedded in the Joint Communiqué.* * *The changes in the positions of the governments of the DPRK and South Korea on the issue of reuniting the country and in their mutual relationship for the moment are undoubtedly positive move in reduction of the tension on the Korean peninsula and for the peaceful resolution of the Korean Issue, which is met with approval by both the Korean people and by the all of the progressive mankind.At the same time though, the existing contradictions between the propagandistic nature of the three “principles” for the reunification of Korea which are the base of the Joint Proclamation between the North and the South on one side, and the internal and international actions of the two governments aimed at mutual elimination and absorption—on the other hand, throw some doubt on achieving quick and significant progress in the development of the issue of reuniting Korea and in regarding relations between the two parts.                                                                                  Prepared by:                                                                                  /Z.

      "정보소련군과 미군의 군사적 활동을 분리하기 위한 일시적인 분계선으로 세계 열강들에 의하여 정해진 38선은 제2차 세계대전, 특히 3년 간의 한국전쟁 (1950년~1953년)의 종전 후에 한국에 주둔해 있는 20만명 규모의 일본군의 항복을 수락하기 위한 목적으로 그어졌다. 하지만 사실상, 이후 38선은 1943년 한국 영토 위에 생겨난 서로 다른 사회적, 정치적 구조를 가진 두 국가 간의 국경선으로 변모했다. 이 두 국가, 즉 조선민주주의인민공화국과 대한민국은 서로를 인정하지 않았으며, 서로가 자신이 한국인 전체를 대표한다고 주장했다. 양측 정부는 계속해서 한국 재통일 문제를 국내외 정치 활동의 주된 과제로 삼아왔다.남한 정부의 입장은 거의 20년 가까운 세월 동안 변함없이 반복적으로 선포되어 왔는데, 남측의 입장은 \"유엔의 감독 하에 전국적 규모의 선거를 실시함으로써 통일을 이룩하는\" 방안으로 요약될 수 있다. 한편 조선민주주의인민공화국 정부가 제안하는 방안은 남측의 위와 같은 입장과는 전혀 상반된다. 즉, 한국 문제에 대한 북측 입장의 핵심은 모든 외국군이 남측 영토에서 철수한 뒤에 \"외세의 개입 없이, 자주적으로, 평화적이고 민주적으로\" 한국 문제를 해결하고 \"한국의 남부지역 및 북부지역에서 전 국민을 대상으로 자유 선거를 실시함으로써 중앙 민주정부를 수립하는 것\" 이다.이렇듯 조선민주주의인민공화국과 대한민국은 근본적으로 양극단의 입장을 보여 왔는데, 3년 간의 한국전쟁이 종전된 뒤에는 양측 간의 모든 연락과 통신이 두절되었다. 한국 통일 문제에 대한 남북 양측의 공식적인 입장은 실질적인 가치를 갖기보다는 선전을 위한 목적을 갖게 되었으며, 유엔에서 한국 문제를 검토하는 데 있어 남북 중 어느 한 쪽을 원조하는 역할을 하게 되었다.1960년대에는 북측과 남측 정부가 비공식적인 계획을 들고 나왔다. 이는 실질적으로는 달성이 불가능한 계획이었는데, 바로 군사력을 통해 한국 재통일을 준비한다는 계획이었다. \"평화적인 방법으로, 민주적인 수단을 통하여\"라는 표현은 껍데기만 남게 되었으며 선전을 목적으로 한 구호로만 사용되었다.남측 정부는 \"북을 향한 행진,\" 그리고 \"공산주의에 대한 승리를 통한 통일\"을 주창했다. 한편 조선민주주의인민공화국에서는 \"미제의 공격적인 군대가 남조선에 주둔해 있고 오늘날 괴뢰들이 판치는 상황에서 평화적인 통일은 상상할 수도 없는 일\"이었다. (김일성 주석 - 조선로동당 제5차 총회에서 조선로동당 중앙위원회의 보고 내용).양측 모두의 노력은 군사를 현대화하고 견고한 국방체계를 수립하는 것을 그 주된 목표로 했는데, 이는 양측 정부의 연간 예산의 대부분을 차지하게 되었으며 병사들과 장교들의 전투정신과 도덕적 정신을 진작시키는 한편 \"전국민\"의 훈련과 무장을 초래하게 되었다.양측이 이처럼 상호간에 양립할 수 없는 정책을 펼치는 동안 비무장지대(DMZ)에서는 지속적으로 사건이 발생하였으며, 간첩 활동을 목적으로 여러 개인과 단체들이 양측에 보내졌고 한반도의 긴장상태가 지속되었다.지난 1971년에는 어느 정도의 변화가 일어났으며, 한국 통일 문제 및 남북관계에 대한 양측의 입장에 있어서도 새로운 국면이 등장하기 시작했다. 양측 상호간의 적대 정책은 계속되었으나, 북측과 남측 관계자는 성명을 통해, 직접적인 연락을 개시하고 회담을 준비하고 대화를 실시할 의향이 있음을 내비쳤다. 물론 이러한 성명은 초기에는 다수의 전제조건을 담고 있었는데, 올해 초에는 크게 다음과 같은 두 가지의 전제 조건이 제시되었다.- 남측 정부가 통일을 위해 \"외세에 의존하는 성향\"을 버릴 것;- 조선민주주의인민공화국 정부가 \"군사력을 통하여 통일을 이룩한다는 계획\"(을 철폐할 것).국제적 환경은 변화를 맞이하였으며 전세계적으로 긴장 완화의 분위기가 확산되고 있다. 또한 소련 및 (미국과의 관계를 개선해 나가고 있는) 중국을 비롯한 사회주의 국가들은 군사력을 통해 한국을 통일한다는 정책에 반대하고 있으며, 남측에는 미군이 주둔해 있는 상황이다. 이 모든 상황들은 조선민주주의인민공화국 정부로 하여금 (당분간은) 군사적 모험을 중단하고 평화적, 민주적인 한국 통일 방식을 추구하도록 하였다. 이는 올해 조선민주주의인민공화국 정부가 시행하고 있는 \"평화적 전진\" 정책의 근간을 이루고 있다.1971년 4월 13일, 조선민주주의인민공화국 최고인민회의는 남측 국민들을 대상으로 선언문을 발표하였는데, 이 선언문은 한국 통일 문제에 대한 조선민주주의인민공화국 정부의 공식적인 입장을 8개의 항으로 나열하였다. 특히 \"박정희의 괴뢰당이 남조선에서 제거되고 진정한 인민에 의한 통치가 수립되거나 애국적이며 민주적인 인물이 권력을 잡는다면, 우리는 북남 간의 협상을 통해 통일 문제를 평화적으로 해결할 준비가 되어 있다\"는 점을 강조했다. 김일성 주석의 8월 6일자 연설에는 이미 박정희의 집권 여당인 민주공화당을 포함한 이들과 협상을 할 의향이 있다는 점이 명시되어 있다.이와 같은 변화는 일본 신문인 \"아사히 신문\" 편집장이 김일성 주석과 가진 인터뷰에서도 확인된다. 해당 인터뷰에서 김일성은 조선민주주의인민공화국이 한국 문제를 평화적으로 해결하고, 통일의 길에 걸림돌이 되는 이들을 제거하기 위해 조선민주주의인민공화국이 소련 및 중국과 체결된 협상, 그리고 남한이 미국 및 일본과 체결한 협상을 동시적으로 폐지하기 위한 정치 회담을 실시할 의향이 있음을 밝혔다.올해 1월 10일 \"요미우리신문\" 특파원들이 김일성 주석에게 질문을 던진 적이 있는데, 이에 대하여 김일성은 \"한국의 휴전협정을 북남 간의 평화 조약으로\" 전환시키는 방안을 제시했다. 이 같은 방안은 실제로 한국 통일을 위한 \"평화적 전진\" 정책의 시발점이 되었다. 그 후 5월 26일에 \"뉴욕타임즈\" 특파원과 김일성 간의 담화에서는 \"북측과 남측 간의 차이점들이 국가 통합 및 조국 재통일의 실현에 걸림돌이 되어서는 안 된다\"는 점을 지적했다.물론, 평화적인 통일 방식으로의 귀환은 조선민주주의인민공화국 정부의 전략적인 움직임이라고 볼 수 있다. 이를 통해 조선민주주의인민공화국 정부는 \"남측에 대한 북측의 적대적 행위\"에 대한 두려움은 불온한 생각이라는 점을 미국과 남측 정부에게 호소함으로써 미군의 철수 시기를 앞당기려 하고 있다. 이와 동시에, 조선민주주의인민공화국 정부는 통일을 이룩하기 위한 과정이 국제적으로 혼란을 초래하지 않게 될, 보다 적절한 시기가 오기를 기다리고 있다.남측 정부의 입장 변화 또한 전략적인 움직임으로 해석될 수 있다.한편으로는 조선민주주의인민공화국의 \"난공불락의 요새\"와 \"무장한 인민\"에, 또 다른 한편으로는 미군 철수 및 미국 군사 원조의 축소라는 \"위험\"에 직면한 남측 정부로서는, 양측 간의 긴장을 완화할 수 있는 방법을 찾는 것 외에는 다른 도리가 없었다. 이는 남측 정부가 조선민주주의인민공화국에 비하여 상대적으로 낙후된 남측의 군사를 현대화하는 작업을 마무리하기 위한 시간과 기회를 벌기 위한 방안이었으며, 미군이 남한에서 철수한 이후에 한반도의 군사적 균형을 유지하기 위해서도 필요한 일이었다. 남측은 어쩔 수 없이 북측과 접촉해야 했으며, 표면상으로나마 한국 통일을 위한 \"자주성 원칙\"을 수락할 수밖에 없었다.하지만 이와 동시에, 1971년 말 남측에서는 내부 체제를 정리하기 위한 목적으로 국가비상사태가 선포되었으며 \"국가안보에 관한 특별조치법\"이 통과되었다. 이로써 박정희는 내부의 반대세력들을 숙청하고 자신의 직접적인 감독과 지도 하에 조선민주주의인민공화국 정부 및 대표단과 집권화된 회담을 실시할 수 있는 무한한 권한과 기회를 얻게 되었다.북측과 남측 간의 최초의 접촉은 1971년 하반기에 적십자사에 의하여 성사되었다.남측의 전보 관련 당국이 보고한 바와 같이, 1971년 8월 12일에 열린 기자회견에서 대한적십자사 최두선 총재는 \"지난 20년 간 헤어져 있었던 한국의 가족들\"을 도울 수 있도록 북측과 남측 적십자사 대표단 간에 회담을 열자고 제안했다. 이 제안에 대해 남측 정부는 즉각 전폭적인 지지 의사를 표명했으며, \"이틀 뒤 조선민주주의인민공화국 역시 지지의 뜻을 밝혔\"다.상호간의 서신 교환을 위한 송달인 간의 회담을 다섯 차례 진행한 끝에, 1971년 9월 20일 판문점에서 제1차 예비협상이 개시되었다.다섯 명으로 구성된 양측 적십자사 파견단 간의 회담 초반에 평양과 서울에서 번갈아 가며 주요 협상을 진행하기로 합의가 이루어졌다. 또한 양측은 판문점의 2개 지점에 2대의 직통 전화선을 설치하기로 합의했다.19 차례의 예비회담이 끝난 뒤에, 주요 협상 의제에 관한 양측 간의 원칙적인 합의가 이루어졌으며, 양측은 마무리 작업을 위해 합의사항을 전문가 그룹에게 제출하였다.비공개로 진행된 전문가들의 작업이 마무리 되고, 제20차 예비회담에서는 주요 협상의 일일 의제가 확정되었다. 의제에는 다음과 같은 사안들이 포함되었다.1. 이산가족 및 친지들의 주소를 추적하고 근황을 파악하여, 이를 이들에게 알린다.2. 이산가족 및 친지들 상호간의 자유로운 방문 및 자유로운 상봉을 실시한다.3. 이산가족 및 친지들 간의 자유로운 연락을 실시한다.4. 이산가족들을 그들의 자유의지와 희망으로 재결합시킨다.5. 기타 인도주의적 해결을 요하는 사안들.제23차 협상에서 양측은 주요 협상을 올해 8월 5일에 실시하기로 합의했다. 또한 양측 파견단의 구성과 이들을 동행할 전문가들에 대한 합의도 이루어졌다. 양측 대표단은 각각 7인으로 구성하며 양측 적십자사 지도자 및 그 대리인으로 하여금 대표단을 이끌게 하고, 70인의 전문가들이 이들을 동행하게끔 하기로 합의했다.제24차 협상에서 예비회담이 종료될 것으로 예상될 즈음, 조선민주주의인민공화국 대표단은 평양과 서울에서 각각 개최될 첫 번째와 두 번째 회담에 북측과 남측의 정당 및 공공단체 대표들을 참석시키는 방안을 추가로 제안했으며, 남측 대표단은 이 제안에 대해 유보적인 입장을 보였다. [이 제안으로 인해] 이미 합의된 날짜인 8월 5일에 협상을 개시하는 것이 불가능해졌다. 한편, 이 제안은 첫 번째 회담 장소에 대한 세부 사항과 관련하여 남측 파견단을 압박하는 수단으로도 사용되었다.합의가 이루어지지 않아 명확히 할 필요가 있는 2건의 사안은 전문가들에 의해 재차 검토되었다. 전문가들은 두세 차례의 회의 끝에 일정한 합의를 도출하였고, 이러한 합의사항은 올해 8월 11일에 개최된 제25차 예비협상에서 발표되었다. 주요협상의 첫 회담은 올해 8월 30일 평양에서 개최하며, 두 번째 회담은 9월 13일에 서울에서 개최한다고 발표되었다.조선민주주의인민공화국과 남한 모두 적십자사 대표단 간 협상을 통일의 길로 가는 첫 번째 단계로 여기고 있다.통일이라는 목표를 향한 두 번째 단계는 전세계인들과 한국인들 모두 예상하지 못했다.올해 7월 4일 오전 10시, 평양과 서울에서 열린 기자회견 및 북측과 남측의 라디오 방송을 통해 \"남북공동성명\"이 발표되었다. 이는 남측 이후락 중앙정보부장의 조선민주주의인민공화국 방문 (1972년 5월 2일~5월 5일) 및 김영주, 김정일과의 담화, 그리고 박성철의 서울 방문 (1972년 5월 29일~6월 1일) 및 이후락, 박정희와의 담화가 이루어낸 결실이었다.첫 번째 합의 내용은 한국 통일 실현의 기반이 될 3대 주요원칙을 아래와 같이 정하고 있다.1. \"자주적으로, 외세의 지원이나 외부의 개입 없이\"2. \"무장 세력을 사용하지 않고 평화적인 방법으로\"3. “사상, 이상 및 체제의 상이함에 관계 없이.\"조선민주주의공화국에서 위와 같은 \"3대 원칙\"을 정한 이는 김일성 주석이다. 올해 7월 20일 조선민주주의인민공화국 적십자사 중앙위원회의 발표에 따르면, 김일성 주석은 \"분단된 조국의 비극적인 상황으로 인하여 그 누구보다도 가슴 속 깊이 고통을 느낀다\"고 말했다.남한에서는 공동성명이 박정희의 \"노력\" 및 한국의 \"평화적, 자주적인 통일\"을 위한 정책이 이뤄낸 결과라고 선전되고 있다.그러나 분명한 사실은, 위와 같은 \"원칙\"의 결정 및 합의는 민족주의적 성격이 강한 남북 정부에 의해 시행된 정책의 결과이며, 남측과 북측이 각각 \"자주성의 원칙\"과 \"평화적 노선\"이라는 상호간의 조건을 용인하고 수락한 결과라는 점이다.김일성 주석은 미국 신문 \"뉴욕타임즈\"의 해리슨 솔즈베리[Harrison Salisbury] 및 존 리[John Lee] 특파원과의 담화에서도 남북 간에 공통된 민족주의적 특성을 강조했다. 김일성 주석은 \"최근에 남조선 지도부는, 비록 말뿐일지 모르나, \"자기주도,\" \"자주성\" 및 \"자주 국방\"에 대해 이야기하고 있으며, 자주적인 통일에 대한 열망에 대해 이야기하고 있다. 긍정적으로 보면, 이는 자립, 자주, 자위에 대한 우리의 생각과 공통점이 있다고 할 수 있겠다.\"실제로는 조선민주주의인민공화국과 남한 모두에서 외세에 대한 굴복에 대항하여 \"주체\"사상 [자립(自立), 자주(自主), 자위(自衛)]의 정신으로 국민을 사상적으로 세뇌시키기 위한 움직임이 활발하게 진행되고 있다. 이러한 민족주의적 특성은 실제로는 매우 논란의 소지가 큰 성격을 갖고 있다. 북측과 남측에서 각각 김일성과 박정희의 \"기발함과 위대함\"을 입증할 때에는 이러한 민족주의적 특성이 사그라들고, 제3국가로부터 정치적, 군사적, 경제적 원조를 비롯한 원조를 받는 일이 문제가 되는 경우에는 완전히 잊혀져 버린다.이러한 사실은 세 번째 원칙, 즉 \"사상, 이상 및 체제의 차이에 관계 없이,\" 또는 남한의 경우 \"민족적 주체사상\"을 기반으로 한 민족 대단결의 성취라는 원칙에 의해서도 확인된다. 이 원칙은 사실 계급 원칙을 \"민족적\" 원칙으로 대체하는 것이며, 사상의 공존을 예견하는 것이다.아래에 열거된 여섯 가지의 개별 합의사항에는 양측 간에 합의된 사안들이 포함되어 있다.- \"서로를 비방하거나 공격하지 않는다.\"- \"무장 도발행위를 자제한다.\"- \"갑작스런 폭력 사태의 발발을 방지하기 위한 조치를 적극적으로 취한다.\"- \"다양한 분야에서 다자간 교환을 조직한다.\"- \"공동성명 및 자주적, 평화적 통일의 실현을 위하여 협력한다.\"- \"적십자사 협상의 조속하고 성공적인 종결을 지원하고 협조한다.\"- \"평양과 서울 간에 직통 전화선을 설치한다.\"- \"북측과 남측 간의 문제를 규제하기 위한 위원회를 구성한다.\"양측 모두 공동성명을 통해 약속한 사항들을 이행하기 시작했는데, 발표 다음날부터 주로 기술적인 방법으로 이행에 착수했다.양측은 보도 및 라디오 방송을 통한 박정희 및 김일성에 대한 비방을 중단했다. 무장 사건 및 분단선 해체에 대한 내용은 아직 발표되지 않았다.서울에 소재한 남한의 한 라디오 방송국에 따르면, 협상 과정에서 김영주 및 이후락이 각각 이끄는 실무 내각 간에 직통 전화선을 연결하기로 합의되었다고 한다. 이 직통 전화선은 이들 실무 내각 또는 이들이 지정하는 3인에 한해 토요일, 일요일 및 휴일을 제외하고 매일 사용할 수 있도록 했다.하지만 양측 정부의 내부적인 정치활동에는 공동성명의 \"원칙\"에 입각한 정신을 바탕으로 한 실질적인 변화가 전혀 관찰되지 않고 있다. 이는 그 원칙이 실제로 유효한 것인지 의구심을 갖게 한다.상호 방문계획 발표 및 합의문 체결은 평양의 외교계 및 남한 국민 모두에게 놀라움을 안겨주었다. 하지만 공동성명 발표 이튿날 이미 신문, 라디오 및 텔레비전 방송은 공동성명에 대한 \"남북 모두의 지대한 관심\"에 관한 메시지로 넘쳐났다. 한국인 대표단들이 각국 대표단들과 가진 회담에서도 한국 통일 문제에 대한 한국인들의 낙관적인 입장이 거듭 표출되었다.남측 기관들에 의하면, 남한 국민들은 북측과 남측 간의 합의를 \"획기적인 소식\"으로 매우 \"들뜬 기분\"으로 받아들였다고 한다.야당인 신민당의 반응은 이와는 다소 상반된다. 신민당은 공동성명이 \"남한의 고립\"을 초래할 수 있는 \"어느 정도의 위험성\"을 갖고 있다고 우려했으며, \"내부 개혁\"을 실시하고 \"통일의 원칙에 입각한 법의 전면적인 개정\"을 시행하며, \"국가비상사태를 철회하고 미국, 일본, 소련, 중국의 도움을 받아 한반도의 긴장을 완화할 것\"을 남측 정부에게 요구했다. 이렇게 함으로써 \"남한의 사회적 체제를 기반으로 하여, 평화적인 방법으로 민주적인 원칙에 따라 국가 권력을 통합하고 자주적으로 통일을 이룩할 수 있을 것\"이라고 하였다.북측과 남측 간의 관계에 변화가 일어나면서 전 세계 대중들로부터도 반응을 이끌어 냈다.사회주의 국가들의 언론은 박성철과 이후락의 합의 내용 및 평양과 서울에서 실시된 기자회견에 관한 내용을 대대적으로 보도했는데, 합의 내용에 대해서는 특정한 입장을 표명하지 않았다.루마니아 지도부는 김일성 및 최용건에게 보낸 전보를 통해 합의 사항을 전적으로 지지한다는 뜻을 밝혔다. 게오르게 마르셰도 김일성에게 전보를 보냈다.가장 열렬한 반응을 보인 것은 중국이다. 중국의 언론은 상세한 정보를 보도하는 한편, 합의 내용을 지지하는 기사와 논평을 실었다.독일민주공화국 대표단 및 베트남민주공화국 대사관은 공동성명에 대해 다소 유보적이며 조심스러운 입장을 표명하고 있다. 독일과 베트남의 동지들은, 독일연방공화국과 남베트남 간의 관계와 관련하여 그들이 시행하였던 정책들의 원칙과 부합하지 않는 요소들이 남북공동성명에 포함되어 있다고 보고 있다.자본주의 국가들의 반응 또한 상이하다.미국과 영국을 비롯한 서방 국가들의 정부는 합의를 환영하는 한편, 남한 정부에 대한 자신들의 지지 의사를 재차 표명하고 있다.일본 정부는 보다 조심스럽게 행동했다.공동성명의 체결에도 불구하고, 조선민주주의공화국과 남한의 정부는 유엔에서의 한국 문제 검토에 대해 두 가지의 상반되는 접근법을 계속 주장하고 있다.조선민주주의인민공화국은 한국 문제를 제27차 유엔 총회에서 검토하는 방안을 주장하고 있는데, 이는 모든 외국 군대의 남한 영토로부터의 철수, 유엔한국위원단 해산, 한국 통일 과정에서 여타 국가들의 한국 문제에 대한 불개입 의무 확약 및 관련 결의의 승인에 대한 문제를 논의하고자 하는 조선민주주의인민공화국의 열망에서 기인한다.이와 같은 조선민주주의인민공화국 정부의 입장은 한국 문제에 대한 해석의 전면적인 전환, 즉 한국 문제를 국제안보와 직결된 문제에서 어떠한 외세의 개입도 없이 한국인들에 의해 직접 해결되어야 할, 순전히 내부 민족의 문제로 완전히 전환하고자 하는 열망에 주로 영향을 받은 것이다.한편, 남측 정부는 \"한국 문제를 논의하게 될 경우 한국 주변에서의 논쟁을 확대시키고 남북 간의 협상 진전에 부정적인 영향을 미치게 될 것이라고 여겨, 한국 문제가 제27차 유엔총회의 의제에 포함되지 않도록 하는 방향으로 정책을 시행하고\" 있다.남측 정부의 입장은, 유엔한국통일부흥위원단 해산 및 남한에서의 미군 철수를 요구하는 결의안이 유엔 총회에서 승인될 가능성에 대한 두려움에 기초하고 있다. 미군의 계속적, 장기적인 남한 내 주둔을 확보하기 위한 남측 정부의 노력은 이와 같은 사실을 확인시켜 주는데, 이는 공동성명에 명시된 한국 통일에 대한 \"자주적이며 외세의 개입 없는 통일\"이라는 원칙에 대한 남측 정부의 공식적인 입장을 증명해주기도 한다.한국 통일 문제 및 남북 관계에 관한 조선민주주의인민공화국 및 남한 정부 입장의 변화는 한반도의 긴장을 완화하고 한국 문제를 평화적으로 해결하기 위한 긍정적인 움직임임에 틀림 없다. 한국인들 뿐 아니라 전 인류 또한 이러한 움직임을 환영하고 있다.하지만 이와 동시에, 북측과 남측 간의 공동성명의 기초가 된 한국 통일의 3대 \"원칙\"이 갖고 있는 선전적 성격, 그리고 상대방의 제거 및 흡수를 목적으로 한 양측 정부의 국내외적 활동 간의 모순은, 한국 통일 문제의 진전 및 양측 관계의 개선에 있어서 조속하고 중대한 성과를 이룰 수 있을지에 대한 의문을 불러일으키기도 한다.작성자: Z.

      "Number (TA) \tRO98367 \t5130Primary: Asia and ChinaSent:  China, December 06, 1979, 03:55Received: MOFA, December 06, 1979, 05:43To: The Foreign Minister  \tFrom: Ambassador YoshidaPrime Minister's Visit to China (First Summit Meeting) (A)Number 2615\tSecret　Top UrgentConcerning Outgoing Telegram No. 2612After the courtesy call described in the initial outgoing telegram, in Anhui Hall, the Great Hall of the People, there took place over the course of two hours the first summit meeting, as follows. (Those attending from the other side were as reported in outgoing telegram No. 2611.)1. Premier Hua started by saying that, as decided previously, he wanted to make international problems the theme of the meeting.  Then, saying that he would like to ask his guest to speak first, in line with Chinese courtesy and custom, he encouraged Prime Minister Ohira to speak. 2. In response, the Prime Minister spoke as follows: (1) I would like to talk of how we view our country's foreign policy and international situation. First, relations between Japan and the United States, in political belief and in social and economic system alike, are better than they have ever been in the history of our bilateral relations. Our country wishes to cherish and maintain more than anything relations between Japan and the United States as a friendly country with a close relationship. Postwar Japan's security, recovery, and achievement of an independent economy are due to the great aid and cooperation of the United States. However, on account of the Vietnam War, the dollar's fall, and such, the United States lacks its former vigor. The thinking is that Japan, dependent on the United States, has reached a period in which it must cooperate as a partner of the United States. At the same time, economic friction is taking place, but Japan's position is one of, resolving this friction, our proceeding in cooperating with the United States. We must have the United States, as a world leader, contribute as a reliable force for stability. Last year we worked to resolve the economic friction between Japan and the United States. This year, in regard to the Iran problem, we are now struggling with what we can and cannot do to bring it as soon as possible to a peaceful settlement.  (2) Seven years have passed since the normalization of relations between Japan and China. We succeeded in concluding a treaty of peace and friendship and working agreements. We are most pleased that trade has steadily grown, people-to-people exchanges have become lively, and overall trust has deepened. We would like this visit to China, too, to make relations between Japan and China even better and broader. (3) Vice Premier Gu Mu requested appropriate cooperation in regard to part of your country's modernization plan. Our government reviewed it and at last arrived at a definite plan. As we have already informed Vice Premier Gu Mu, we would like to cooperate on six of the eight projects and to have the implementing authorities hammer out the details.  (4) As for government loans, talks on a bilateral basis are advancing between our two countries. As we discussed in the car on the way from the airport, in regard to the issue of developing the oil in Bohai, we are most pleased that the talks between Japan and China have been brought to a close. The long-term trade agreement has been concluded and bank loans have been made.  Our thinking, then, is that we would like to undertake economic cooperation not only between governments but via the private sector as well. (5) When I previously visited China and met the late Premier Zhou, he said that relations of friendship and cooperation between our two countries had to benefit not the stability and prosperity of our two countries alone but that of the region. Japan and China's having a relationship of friendship and cooperation has become a major condition for the stability of the Asian region. (6) A peninsula is always something like a powder keg.  For example, like the Balkan, Korean, and Indochinese peninsulas, they became the seeds of conflict.  What our two countries undertake or do not undertake has a political influence. In this sense, I will speak first of the problem of the Korean Peninsula. The problem of the Korean Peninsula's unification is for the Korean people alone. The reality, unfortunately, is a situation of confrontation between two authorities. Some years ago, we had hoped that the North-South talks would bear fruit. At present, unfortunately, there is nothing to see for it. There is a need to create a good environment for North-South talks. Your country has close relations with the North. Japan has relations with the South. The United States, your country, Japan, and the Soviet Union must think what to do and what not to do for the sake of the peninsula's stability.  I would like to hear your country's judgment on this point. (7) As for the Indochinese Peninsula, tension continues there. Cambodia, too, is in an extremely difficult situation. We have delicate relations, but I would like to hear the opinion of your country, which has influence in this region.  (8) Japan has been developing relatively good relations with the five countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The entire Pacific region is in a terribly difficult situation, but we are thinking about the functional strengthening of resources and trade as such. New Zealand, Canada, the United States, Mexico, and other countries have a common awareness on resource and trade relations and are maintaining close relations. Also, there are many independent countries in Oceania. (9) As for relations between Japan and the Soviet Union, there is no change in Japan's basic policy of resolving the territorial issue and concluding a peace treaty. It is regrettable that settlement of the territorial issue is not in sight. However, working relations in such areas as the economy, trade, and culture are steadily growing and pose no fundamental problem. Recently, the Soviet Union has strengthened its military forces in the Northern Territories. This is of great concern to our country. It is unclear why that should happen at this time, but the Soviet Union's behavior is a threat to peace. (10) The world economy is in a difficult situation. Expanding the entire economy is in the interest both of Japan and of the world. Japan, too, for its part, is therefore aiming to carry out cooperation as an advanced country. Constraints have emerged in the problems of resources and oil, and currencies are also in a difficult situation.  (11) Premier Hua, you visited four countries in Western Europe. Following your visit, how do you view the situation? Also, I would like to hear your view on the Sino-Soviet talks taking place in Moscow. 3. In response, Premier Hua spoke as follows: (1) Prime Minister Ohira, I thank you for your detailed explanation regarding Japan's foreign policy. As for China's view regarding the development of the world situation, I think that you are aware of it, as Vice Premier Deng told you on his way back to China from his visit to the United States. Vice Premier Deng said that the international situation, seen on the whole, is not benign but is heading toward turmoil and disorder. At present, nine months since then, the situation is truly even more tumultuous and tense.  (2) As a concrete manifestation of this, with the problem between Israel and the Arabs unresolved, the problem between the United States and Iran is emerging and showing signs of expanding. Problems are also arising in Saudi Arabia. When turmoil develops in the oil-producing regions of the Middle East and the Persian Gulf, the threat to Western Europe's oil imports grows large. With no sign of a relaxation in tensions in relations between the United States and Iran, US embassies in such countries as Libya and Pakistan have been set on fire. China is greatly concerned by the development of the situation in this region. The four Western European countries that I recently visited are also uneasy about the region. (3) Concerning the Indochina problem, Vietnam is carrying out a dry-season offensive against Cambodia. This is not simply a Cambodian problem. It is a threat to the five countries of ASEAN, particularly for Thailand and Malaysia. Behind it is the Soviet Union's global strategy. (4) The Soviet Union is strengthening its armaments, including the deployment of SS20 missiles, against Western Europe. I think that the countries of Western Europe, therefore, should strengthen their defenses to deal with this threat. The countries of Western Europe see that the source of such tension lies in the Soviet Union's meddling in the Middle East. That becomes a setup for going around and encircling Europe. It seems that the Soviet Union is thinking of winning without fighting. The Soviet Union's going on the offensive against the \"soft underbelly\" of the Middle East, with its oil-producing countries, is an attempt to go around Western Europe. (5) Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia, too, frankly would not have been possible without the support of the Soviet Union. Article six of the Soviet treaty in reality has the character of a military alliance. Vietnam, without the guarantee of this treaty, would not have made such a headlong advance. If Vietnam takes control of Laos and Cambodia and moves into ASEAN, it will be able to control Atlantic and Pacific routes, and the Malacca Strait in particular. The Soviet Union's gaining control of that strait would be a threat both to China and to the United States and Japan as well. It would also be an aid to Soviet security in Asia. (6) A certain international institute in its outlook for the 1980s has forecast 1985 as a dangerous time, and we are also paying attention to it. There are some grounds to this forecast. For example, in 1985 the Soviet Union may have superiority in nuclear weapons compared to the United States. Amon Japanese researchers there are some who are saying something similar. (7) Our view is that there is a possibility of a third world war taking place in the 1980s but that it can be put off with the cooperation of the whole world.There are now three \"hot spots.\" Those are the Middle East, Indochina, and Africa. Visiting Western Europe, I realized that the Middle East is the hottest of the \"hot spots\" and that we will have to keep an eye on what happens there. There is no sign that the disorder in Iran, which is the second country in oil production, can be calmed soon. In Saudi Arabia, too, contradictions are occurring. (8) Concerning the Korean Peninsula problem, Vice Premier Deng has already spoken of it to Prime Minister Ohira. The recent killing of Park Chung Hee is evidence that South Korea's social and political crises are growing worse. North Korea is showing self-restraint in regard to such an event in South Korea. Thus, it is evident that the crisis on the Korean Peninsula is not one of the North advancing south.  When this event occurred in South Korea, President Kim Il Sung announced the slogan of unity, cooperation, and reunification and has proposed holding talks anywhere and with anyone. Some American friends worry about the North advancing south, but there is no need for such concern. President Kim Il Sung is seeking the peaceful reunification of Korea with the slogan of independent and peaceful reunification. What we know is that he is saying that Korea even after reunification will continue an independent, neutral and non-allied policy. We have expressed our approval to President Kim Il Sung. Our hope would be for China and Japan to encourage South Korea's democratization. How do you think of that? We would like to discuss this point with our American friends as well. As you have said, Prime Minister Ohira, we would like to create a good environment, encourage North-South talks, and encourage the reunification of the North and South. This would be a plus for China and Japan, as well as for the peace and stability of the Asia-Pacific region. (9) Concerning the Indochina problem, Vice Premier Deng spoke to Prime Minister Ohira in Japan concerning self-defensive counterattack and limiting it.  The problem of Indochina is not only a problem of Vietnam but one linked to Vietnamese and Soviet hegemonist expansion and invasion. Thinking that China doing nothing was wrong and wondering what to do, we decided in the end on a limited self-defensive counterattack. Had we not limited  it, advancing south after the capture of Lang Son would have been easy. If not for self-defensive counterattack, Cambodian resistance forces would long since have been eliminated and Vietnam would have made a move on Thailand and Malaysia. (10) Vietnam has 200,000 troops in Cambodia and is now conducting a dry-season offensive. However, Cambodia's people's war has the support of the people, so it will not be easy for Vietnam to thoroughly eliminate the resistance forces. (11) The ASEAN countries oppose Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia and demand the withdrawal of those troops. Their position is clear. In the UN General Assembly, ASEAN's proposal passed. The situation is still not ripe for carrying out a political settlement. China supports Democratic Kampuchea's fight and supports the ASEAN countries. If Vietnam were to invade Thailand, China would stand on the side of Thailand. (12) The Cambodian people have been suffering since Vietnam invaded. Many countries, including various ones in Western Europe, have talked about Cambodian refugee relief. I, too, while visiting Europe, along with expressing approval there and speaking of our desire to cooperate, said that we would welcome any refugees who would like to come to China. Also, in regard to the relief route, I proposed sending relief through Thailand, as sending it through Vietnam or Heng Samrin would put it in their hands. The European countries expressed approval for my proposal. The United States for a time sought to normalize relations with Vietnam but has postponed it, having seen Cambodia's invasion by Vietnam. We approve of this.  Japan, too, has frozen aid to Vietnam, and we approve of this as well. 4. At this point, with the time for the reception drawing near, we decided to continue on the 6th and brought today's meeting to a close. (End)\n",

(Attending: Vice Premier Gu Mu and Foreign Minster Huang Hua from the Chinese side; Foreign Minister Okita and Asian Affairs Bureau Director-General Yanagiya from the Japanese side)1. Prime Minister Ohira described how useful the morning's meeting with Vice Premier Deng had been. In response, Premier Hua said that he felt the same way and, having already heard what had been discussed, would not repeat that discussion. 2. Prime Minister Ohira, saying that he had raised points (1) and (2) below with Vice Premier Deng and that he would like to reiterate them with Premier Hua, spoke as follows.(1) It was very useful to hear Vice Premier Deng's description of China's global vision in its understanding of and strategy in regard to the Indochinese peninsula. Our country's consistent position has been that international conflicts should be resolved by peaceful means and, on the basis of such a position, we have made proposals concerning the Indochinese conflict as well to your country and relevant countries.   Furthermore, regarding our country's aid to Vietnam, we have to honor our commitment. We would like to decide when to do so in judging ourselves the various circumstances.(2) Concerning relations between Japan and Taiwan, we obtained from the Chinese side at the time of Japan and China's normalization of relations the understanding that we would maintain non-governmental relations with Taiwan. We have continued them to this day. Our country is not thinking as our policy to expand those working relations and has no thought to violate the framework of the Japan-China Joint Communique.  We would like you to understand the increase in the quantity of those working relations as happening merely as \"natural growth.\" In any event, we will consult with the Chinese side when we are going to do something major. (3) On the Korean issue, Premier Hua said yesterday that China also approves of endeavoring to create an international environment conducive to North-South dialogue. Our two countries have a common position on this point. Prime Minister Ohira next touched on the democratization of the Republic of Korea (ROK), saying that its foremost requirement is the promotion of dialogue. The Government of Japan considers that the paths that various countries follow are for those countries themselves to decide and that third countries should follow those choices. We think that the ROK Government is making efforts towards democratization. We also think it would be reassuring if your country, hereafter and as necessary, would encourage North Korean self-restraint.3.  Next, Premier Hua made the following comments:(1) China has praised Japan's temporary halt in aid to Vietnam. China considers giving aid to Vietnam, at a time when it has invaded another country, disagreeable for countries, such as the ASEAN countries, threatened by Vietnam. It is for Japan to decide when to carry out what it has promised but, as Japan has good relations with the ASEAN countries, China thinks that it would be good to proceed in seeking the views of the ASEAN countries.   (2) Concerning relations between Japan and Taiwan, I am happy with what Prime Minister Ohira has said. Prime Minister Ohira has said that Japan, in observing the framework Japan-China Joint Communique, would like China to understand the existence of relations between Japan and Taiwan as working relations at the non-governmental level and their mere \"natural growth.\" Of course, that is something that we can understand. Also, I am very happy to hear Prime Minister Ohira say that Japan would inform and consult with us in advance of major acts. That such discussion is possible is, I think, an expression of how very well relations between China and Japan are going. (3) Concerning the Korean issue, I would like China, Japan, and the United States to work together to influence Korea and create an environment for the promotion of dialogue and the realization of an independent and peaceful reunification. I believe that North Korea's moving south by force will absolutely not happen. Furthermore, Kim Il Sung has said that when peaceful reunification is realized, a non-aligned and neutral Korea will be established. This would be beneficial to peace in Asia. If it were to happen, the Soviet Union would find it difficult to make a move, even if it tried.(End)\n",

      " Top Secret  Copy No. 1From the Journal of      P.F. Yudin   “5” April 1956No. 289RECORD OF CONVERSATIONwith Comrade Mao Zedong31 March 1956Today I visited Mao Zedong and gave him Comrade Khrushchev’s letter about the assistance which the Soviet Union will provide:  1) in the construction of 51 enterprises and 3 scientific research institutes for military industry, 2) in the construction of a railroad line from Urumqi to the Soviet-Chinese border.  Mao Zedong asked me to send his deep gratitude to the CC CPSU and the Soviet government.Further I said that I had wanted to visit him (Mao Zedong) in the very first days following my return to Beijing and to tell about the work of the 20th Congress of the CPSU and, in particular, about Comrade Khrushchev’s speech at the closed session regarding the cult of personality.  Mao Zedong responded that because of his illness he had found it necessary to put off the meeting with me.  Mao Zedong said that the members of the CPC delegation who had attended the 20th Congress had told him something about the work of the Congress and had brought one copy of Comrade Khrushchev’s speech regarding the cult of personality.  That speech has already been translated into Chinese and he had managed to become acquainted with it.During a conversation about I.V. Stalin’s mistakes Mao Zedong noted that Stalin’s line on the China question, though it had basically been correct, in certain periods he, Stalin, had made serious mistakes.  In his speeches in 1926 Stalin had exaggerated the revolutionary capabilities of the Guomintang, had spoken about the Guomintang as the main revolutionary force in China.  In 1926 Stalin had given the Chinese Communists an instruction about the orientation to the Guomintang, having viewed it as a united front of the revolutionary forces of China.  Stalin said that it is necessary to depend on the Guomintang, to follow after that party, i.e. he spoke directly about the subordination of the Communist Party of China to the Guomintang.  This was a great mistake which had held back the independent work of the Communist Party of China on the mobilization of the masses and on attracting them to the side of the Communist Party.Through the Comintern, Mao Zedong continued, Stalin, having become after the death of V.I. Lenin the de facto leader of the Comintern, gave to the CC CPC a great number of incorrect directives.  These mistaken and incorrect directives resulted from the fact that Stalin did not take into account the opinion of the CPC.  At that time Van Minh, being a Comintern worker, met frequently with Stalin and tendentiously had informed him about the situation in the CPC.  Stalin, evidently, considered Van Minh the single exponent of the opinion of the CC CPC.Van Minh and Li Lisan, who represented the CPC in the Comintern, tried to concentrate the whole leadership of the CPC in their own hands.  They tried to present all the Communists who criticized the mistakes of Van Minh and Li Lisan as opportunists.  Mao Zedong said, they called me a right opportunist and a narrow empiricist.  As an example of how the Comintern acted incorrectly in relation to the Communist Party of China, Mao Zedong introduced the following.Under the pretext that the Third Plenum of the CC CPC, while considering the coup-plotting errors of Li Lisan, had not carried the successive criticism of these mistakes to its conclusion and allegedly so as to correct the mistakes of the Third Plenum of the CC CPC, the Comintern after 3-4 months had sent to China two of its own workers - [Pavel] Mif and Van Minh - charged with the task of conducting the Fouth Plenum of the CPC.  Nonetheless the decisions of the Fourth Plenum of the CC CPC made under the pressure of Mif and Van Minh, were in fact more ultra-leftist that Li Lisan’s line.  In them it was stated that it is necessary to move into the large cities, to take control of them, and not to conduct the struggle in rural regions.  In the decisions of the Fourth Plenum of the CC CPC there was permitted such, for example, a deviation, that in the Soviet regions of China which were blockaded by the Guomintang even the petty trading bourgeoisie was liquidated and all kinds of internal trade was stopped.  As a result of this policy the Chinese Red Army, which in 1929 was comprised of 300,000 fighters, was reduced by 1934-35 to 25,000, and the territory which made up the Soviet regions of China was reduced by 99%.  CPC organizations in the cities were routed by the Guomintang and the number of Communists was reduced from 300,000 to 26,000 people.  The Soviet regions were totally isolated from the remaining part of the country and remained without any products, even without salt.  All this caused serious discontent among the population of the Soviet regions.As a result of the ultra-leftist policy of Van Minh, the more or less large regions which remained under CPC leadership were mostly in North China (the provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia), to which Van Minh’s power did not extend.  Van Minh, backed by the Comintern, essentially managed it so that the 8th and 4th armies removed themselves from subordination to the CC CPC.Van Minh and his successors saw the Guomintang as the “young power,” which absorbs all the best and will be able to gain a victory over Japan.  They spoke against the independent and autonomous policy of the Communist Party in the united front, and against the strengthening of the armed forces of the CPC and revolutionary bases, against the unification of all strata of the population around the policy of the CPC.  Van Minh’s supporters tried to replace the genuinely revolutionary program of the CPC, which consisted of 10 points, with their own six-point program, the author of which was Van Minh, although this was, in the essence of the matter, a capitulationist program.  In conducting this whole program Van Minh, backed by the Comintern and in Stalin’s name, spoke as the main authority.Van Minh’s supporters, taking advantage of the fact that they had captured a majority in the Southern bureau of the CC CPC in Wuhan, gave incorrect directives to the army and to the local authorities.  So, for example, once, to our surprise, said Mao Zedong, even in Yanan the slogans of the CPC which were posted on the walls of the houses were replaced, on Van Minh’s order, with slogans “about a stable union with the Guomintang,” etc.As a result of the serious ideological struggle and the great explanatory work following the 7th Congress of the Communist Party, especially in the last four years, the majority of Communists who made left or right errors acknowledged their guilt.  Van Minh at the 7th Congress also wrote a letter with acknowledgement of his mistakes, however he then once again returned to his old positions.  All of the former activity of Van Minh, Mao Zedong said, which was carried out under the direct leadership of the Comintern and Stalin, inflicted a serious loss to the Chinese revolution. Characterizing the Comintern’s activity overall, Mao Zedong noted that while Lenin was alive he had played the most prominent role in bringing together the forces of the Communist movement, in the creation and consolidation of the Communist parties in various countries, in the fight with the opportunists from the Second International.  But that had been a short period in the activity of the Comintern.  Consequently, to the Comintern came “officials” like Zinoviev, Bukharin, Piatnitskii and others, who as far as China was concerned, trusted Van Minh more than the CC CPC.  In the last period of the Comintern’s work, especially when Dimitrov worked there, certain movements were noticed, since Dimitrov depended on us and trusted the CC CPC, rather than Van Minh.  However, in this period as well, not just a few mistakes were made by the Comintern, for example, the dissolution of the Polish Communist Party and others.  In this way, said Mao Zedong, it is possible to discern three periods in the activity of the Comintern, of which the second, longest period, brought the biggest loss to the Chinese revolution.  Moreover, unfortunately, precisely in this period the Comintern dealt most of all with the East.  We can say directly, commented Mao Zedong, that the defeat of the Chinese revolution at that time was, right along with other reasons, also the result of the incorrect, mistaken actions of the Comintern.  Therefore, speaking openly, noted Mao Zedong, we were satisfied when we found out about the dissolution of the Comintern.In the last period, continued Mao Zedong, Stalin also incorrectly evaluated the situation in China and the possibilities for the development of the revolution.  He continued to believe more in the power of the Guomintang than of the Communist Party.  In 1945 he insisted on peace with Jiang Jieshi’s [Chiang Kai-shek’s] supporters, on a united front with the Guomintang and the creation in China of a “democratic republic.”  In particular, in 1945 the CC CPC received a secret telegram, for some reason in the name of the “RCP(b)” (in fact from Stalin), in which it was insisted that Mao Zedong travel to Chuntsin for negotiations with Jiang Jieshi.  The CC CPC was against this journey, since a provocation from Jiang Jieshi’s side was expected.  However, said Mao Zedong, I was required to go since Stalin had insisted on this.  In 1947, when the armed struggle against the forces of Jiang Jieshi was at its height, when our forces were on the brink of victory, Stalin insisted that peace be made with Jiang Jieshi, since he doubted the forces of the Chinese revolution.  This lack of belief remained in Stalin even during the first stages of the formation of the PRC, i.e. already after the victory of the revolution.  It is possible that Stalin’s lack of trust and suspiciousness were caused by the Yugoslavian events, particularly since at that time, said Mao Zedong with a certain disappointment, many conversations took place to the effect that the Chinese Communist Party was going along the Yugoslav path, that Mao Zedong is a “Chinese Tito.”  I told Mao Zedong that there were no such moods and conversations in our Party.The bourgeois press around the world, continued Mao Zedong, particularly the right socialists, had taken up the version of “China’s third way,” and extolled it.  At that time, noted Mao Zedong, Stalin, evidently, did not believe us, while the bourgoisie and laborites sustained the illusion of the “Yugoslav path of China,” and only Jiang Jieshi alone “defended” Mao Zedong, shrieking that the capitalist powers should not in any circumstance believe Mao Zedong, that “he will not turn from his path,” etc.  This behavior of Jiang Jieshi is understandable, since he knows us too well, he more than once had to stand in confrontation to us and to fight with us.The distrust of Stalin to the CPC, Mao Zedong continued further, was apparent also during the time of Mao Zedong’s visit to the Soviet Union.  One of our main goals for the trip to Moscow was the conclusion of a Chinese-Soviet treaty on friendship, cooperation and mutual assistance.  The Chinese people asked us whether a treaty of the USSR with the new China will be signed, why until now legally there continues to exist a treaty with the supporters of the Guomintang, etc.  The issue of the treaty was an extremely important matter for us, which determined the possibilities for the further development of the PRC.  At the first conversation with Stalin, Mao Zedong said, I brought a proposal to conclude a treaty along government lines, but Stalin declined to answer.  During the second conversation I returned once again to that issue, showing Stalin a telegram from the CC CPC with the same type of proposal about a treaty.  I proposed to summon Zhou Enlai to Moscow to sign the treaty, since he is the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  Stalin used this suggestion as a pretext for refusal and said that “it is inconvenient to act in this way, since the bourgeois press will cry that the whole Chinese government is located in Moscow.” Subsequently, Stalin refrained from any meetings with me.  From my side there was an attempt to phone him in his apartment, but they responded to me that Stalin is not home, and recommended that I meet with [A.I.] Mikoyan.  All this offended me, Mao Zedong said, and I decided to undertake nothing further and to wait it out at the dacha.  Then an unpleasant conversation took place with [I.V.] Kovalev and [N.T.] Fedorenko, who proposed that I go on an excursion around the country. I sharply rejected this proposal and responded that I prefer “to sleep through it at the dacha.”Some time later, continued Mao Zedong, they handed me a draft of my interview for publication which had been signed by Stalin.  In this document it was reported that negotiations are being held in Moscow on concluding a Soviet-Chinese treaty.  This already was a significant step forward.  It is possible that in Stalin’s change of position, said Mao Zedong, we were helped by the Indians and the English, who had recognized the PRC in January 1950.  Negotiations began right after this, in which Malenkov, Molotov, Mikoyan, Bulganin, Kaganovich and Beria took part.  During the negotiations, at Stalin’s initiative there was undertaken an attempt by the Soviet Union to assume sole ownership of the Chinese Changchun (i.e. Harbin) Railway.  Subsequently, however, a decision was made about the joint exploitation of the Chinese Changchun (i.e. Harbin) Railway, besides which the PRC gave the USSR the naval base in Port Arthur, and four joint stock companies were opened in China.  At Stalin’s initiative, said Mao Zedong, Manchuria and Xinjiang were practically turned into spheres of influence of the USSR.  Stalin insisted on the fact that in these regions only Chinese  people and Soviet citizens be permitted to live.  Representatives of other foreign states, including Czechs, Polish people, and Englishmen who were living permanently in those regions should be evicted from there.  The only ones whom Stalin skipped over through his silence were Koreans, of whom there are counted one and a half million in Manchuria.  These types of pretensions from Stalin’s side, said Mao Zedong,  were incomprehensible to us.  All this also was fodder for the bourgeois press and representatives of capitalist states.  In fact, continued Mao Zedong, in the course of the negotiations around this treaty, there was the most genuine trading going on.  It was an unattractive way to pose the issue, in which Stalin’s distrust and suspicion of the CPC was brightly expressed.We are glad to note, said Mao Zedong, that the Chinese Changchun (i.e. Harbin) Railway and Port Arthur have been returned to China, and the joint stock companies have ceased to exist.  In this part of the conversation Mao Zedong stressed that Khrushchev did not attend these negotiations, and that Bulganin’s participation in them was minimal.  Stalin’s distrust of the CPC was apparent in a number of other issues, including Kovalev’s notorious document about anti-Soviet moods in the leadership of the CPC.  Stalin, in passing this document to the CC CPC, wanted, evidently, to stress his mistrust and suspicions.Over the course of the time I spent in Moscow, said Mao Zedong, I felt that distrust of us even more strongly and there I asked that a Marxist-representative of the CC CPSU be sent to China in order to become acquainted with the true situation in China and to get to know the works of the Chinese theoreticians, and simultaneously to examine the works of Mao Zedong, since these works in the Chinese edition were not reviewed by the author in advance, while the Soviet comrades, counter to the wish of the author, insisted on their publication.Mao Zedong reminded me that upon my (Yudin’s) arrival in China he had persistently and specially recommended to me to complete a trip around the whole country.  In relation to this I told Mao Zedong about a conversation which I had with Stalin, in the presence of several members of the Politburo, upon my return from the trip to China.  Stalin at that time asked me whether the ruling Chinese comrades are Marxists.  Having heard my affirming response, Stalin said, “That’s good!  We can be calm.  They’ve grown up themselves, without our help.”Mao Zedong noted that in the very posing of this question Stalin’s distrust of the Chinese Communists was also made apparent.Important things which, evidently, to some extent strengthened Stalin’s belief in the CPC, were your (Yudin’s) report about the journey to China and the Korean War-performance of the Chinese people’s volunteers.In such a way, said Mao Zedong, if we look historically at the development of the Chinese revolution and at Stalin’s attitude to it, then it is is possible to see that serious mistakes were made, which were especially widespread during the time of the Comintern’s work.  After 1945, during the period of the struggle with Jiang Jieshi, because of the overestimation of the forces of the Guomintang and the underestimation of the forces of the Chinese revolution, Stalin undertook attempts at pacification, at restraining the development of the revolutionary events.  And even after the victory of the revolution Stalin continued to express mistrust of the Chinese Communists.  Despite all that, said Mao Zedong, we have stood firmly behind the revolutionary positions, for if we had permitted vascillations and indecisiveness, then, no doubt, long ago we would not have been among the living.Then Mao Zedong moved on to a general evaluation of Stalin’s role.  He noted that Stalin, without a doubt, is a great Marxist, a good and honest revolutionary.  However, in his great work in the course of a long period of time he made a number of great and serious mistakes, the primary ones of which were listed in Khrushchev’s speech.  These fundamental mistakes, said Mao Zedong, could be summed up in seven points:1.  Unlawful repressions;2.  Mistakes made in the course of the war, moreover, in particular in the beginning, rather than in the concluding period of the war;3.  Mistakes which dealt a serious blow to the union of the working class and the peasantry.  Mao Zedong observed that this group of mistakes, in particular, the incorrect policy in relation to the peasantry, was discussed during Comrade Khrushchev’s conversation with [PRC military leader] Zhu De in Moscow;4.  Mistakes in the nationality question connected to the unlawful resettlement of certain nationalities and others.  However, overall, said Mao Zedong, nationality policy was implemented correctly;5.  Rejection of the principle of collective leadership, conceit and surrounding himself with toadies;6.  Dictatorial methods and leadership style;7.  Serious mistakes in foreign policy (Yugoslavia, etc.).Mao Zedong further stressed a thought to the effect that overall in the Communist movement great victories were won.  The single fact of the growth of the Socialist camp from 200 million people to 900 million people speaks for itself.  However, in the course of successful forward advance in some certain countries, in some certain parties these or other mistakes arose.  Mistakes similar to these and others, he said, can arise in the future too.  I observed that it would be better not to repeat mistakes like Stalin’s.  To this, Mao Zedong answered that, evidently, there will be these types of mistakes again.  The appearance of these mistakes are entirely explicable from the point of view of dialectical materialism, since it is well known that society develops through a struggle of contradictions, the fight of the old with the new, the new-born with the obsolete.  In our consciousness, said Mao Zedong, there are still too many vestiges of the past.  It lags behind the constantly developing material world, behind everyday life.In our countries, continued Mao Zedong, much has come from the former, capitalist society.  Take, for example, the issue of the application of corporal punishments to the accused.  For China too, this is not a new issue.  Even in 1930 in the Red Army during interrogations beatings were broadly applied.  I, said Mao Zedong, at that time personally was a witness to how they beat up the accused.  Already at that time a corresponding decision was made regarding a ban on corporal punishment.  However, this decision was violated, and in Yanan, it is true, we tried not to allow unlawful executions.  With the creation of the PRC we undertook a further struggle with this ugly manifestation.  It is entirely evident, continued Mao Zedong, that according to the logic of things during a beating the one who is being beaten begins to give false testimony, while the one who is conducting the interrogation accepts that testimony as truth.  This and other vestiges which have come to us from the bourgeois past, will still for a long time be preserved in the consciousness of people.  A striving for pomposity, for ostentatiousness, for broad anniversary celebrations, this is also a vestige of the psychology of bourgeois man, since such customs and such psychology objectively could not arise among the poorest peasantry and the working class.  The presence of these and other circumstances, said Mao Zedong, creates the conditions for the arising of those or other mistakes with which the Communist parties will have to deal.I observed that the main reason for Stalin’s mistakes was the cult of personality, bordering on deification.Mao Zedong, having agreed with me, noted that Stalin’s mistakes accumulated gradually, from small ones growing to huge ones.  To crown all this, he did not acknowledge his own mistakes, although it is well known that it is characteristic of a person to make mistakes.  Mao Zedong told how, reviewing Lenin’s manuscripts, he had become convinced of the fact that even Lenin crossed out and re-wrote some phrases or other in his own works.  In conclusion to his characterization of Stalin, Mao Zedong once again stressed that Stalin had made mistakes not in everything, but on some certain issues.Overall, he stressed that the materials from the Congress made a strong impression on him.  The spirit of criticism and self-criticism and the atmosphere which was created after the Congress will help us, he said, to express our thoughts more freely on a range of issues.  It is good that the CPSU has posed all these issues.  For us, said Mao Zedong, it would be difficult to take the initiative on this matter.Mao Zedong declared that he proposes to continue in the future the exchange of opinions on these issues during Comrade Mikoyan’s visit, and also at a convenient time with Comrades Khrushchev and Bulganin.Then Mao Zedong got distracted from this topic and getting greatly carried away briefly touched on a few philosophical questions (about the struggle of materialism with idealism, etc.).  In particular he stressed that it is incorrect to imagine to oneself Communist society as a society which is free from any sort of contradictions, from ideological struggle, from any sort of vestiges of the past.  In a Communist society too, said Mao Zedong, there will be good and bad people.  Further he said that the ideological work of China still to a significant extent suffers from a spirit of puffery [nachetnichestva] and cliches.  The Chinese press, in particular, still cannot answer to the demands which are presented to it.  On the pages of the newspapers the struggle of opinions is lacking, there are no serious theoretical discussions.  Because of insufficient time Mao Zedong expressed a wish to meet with me again to talk a little specifically about issues of philosophy.At the end of the discussion I inquired of Mao Zedong whether he had become acquainted with the Pravda editorial about the harm of the cult of personality, a translation of which was placed in [Renmin Ribao] on 30 March.  He responded that he still had not managed to read through that article, but they had told him that it is a very good article.  Now, said Mao Zedong, we are preparing for publication in Renmin Ribao a lead article  which is dedicated to this issue, which should appear in the newspapers in the coming week.  Beginning on 16 March, he noted jokingly, all the newspapers in the world raised a ruckus about this issue—China alone for the time being is silent.Then I briefly told Mao Zedong about the arrival in the PRC of 16 prominent Soviet scholars and about the beginning of the work of a theoretical conference dedicated to the 20th Congress, which is opening today in the Club of Soviet specialists.  Soviet and Chinese scholars will deliver speeches at the conference.Mao Zedong listened to these thoughts with great interest.The conversation continued for three hours.  Mao Zedong was in a good mood, and joked often.The Deputy Head of the Adminstration of Affairs of the CPC Yang Shankun, the Chief of the CC CPC Translation Bureau Shi Zhe and Counselor of the USSR Embassy in the PRC Skvortsov, T.F. attended the conversation.AMBASSADOR OF THE USSR TO THE PRC P.

On the Korean question, when I (Mao Zedong) was in Moscow [in December 1949-January 1950] we came to an understanding about everything, the issue was not about the seizure of South Korea, but about the significant strengthening of North Korea. But subsequently Kim Il Sung was in Moscow, where some kind of agreement was reached, about which no one considered it necessary to consult with us beforehand. It should be noted, said Mao Zedong, that there was a serious miscalculation in the Korean war about the supposed impossibility of intervention of international forces on the side of South Korea...P.

      "[...]Minutes of Conversation between Zhou Enlai and Soviet Ambassador [Pavel] Yudin (unreviewed)Time: 8 January 1958Location: Xihuating Translator and documentation: Fang Zu’An[...]Premier [Zhou Enlai]: Today, I want to discuss with you the Korean issue. In Moscow, Chairman Mao [Zedong] discussed the withdrawal of our [People’s] Volunteer Army from [North] Korea with Premier Kim Il Sung. During the first talk, Kim Il Sung was afraid that, at present, it would not be good to withdraw the [People’s] Volunteer Army. During the second talk, Kim Il Sung agreed to the withdrawal of the [People’s] Volunteer ArmyVolunteer Army, believing that this could be a problem for the United States and would be beneficial [to North Korea]. Presently, United Nations forces are still garrisoned in South Korea, so if we withdraw, this could push a number of countries to demand that their units in the United Nations forces also be withdrawn. The United States will be isolated. Currently, the United States, seeking to reduce the burden of military assistance to Syngman Rhee, is pushing Rhee to reduce his armed forces. Syngman Rhee, however, is unwilling to reduce his armed forces, using the pretext that North Korea’s armed forces are strong and have [the backing of] the [People’s] Volunteer Army. If we withdraw, it will have an impact. On the other hand, after we withdraw, the Korean People’s Army can take over the defense of the 38th parallel and gradually gain experience. At the same time, we will withdraw the [People’s] Volunteer Army in phases and garrison the withdrawn forces along the Yalu River. If something were to occur, and if the [North] Korean government believed it to be necessary, we [could still] cross the river and strike the enemy at any time.[Pavel] Yudin: Is Premier Zhou referring to a withdrawal of all forces?Premier: Yes, a complete withdrawal. At the time [of the conversations in Moscow], Premier Kim Il Sung indicated that he would reply back to Chairman Mao after he returned [to North Korea] and had discussions with the Central Committee [of the Korean Workers’ Party]. After Kim Il Sung returned [to North Korea], he sent two telegrams to Chairman Mao. In the first telegram he said that the Central Committee of the Korean Workers’ Party agreed that we withdraw the [People’s] Volunteer Army. In the second telegram, he proposed two methods and asked for our opinion. One opinion is for the [North] Korean government to issue a statement requesting the withdrawal of forces from both sides [North Korea and South Korea], and then the Chinese government would express agreement and support [for this proposal]. The other method is for the Chinese government to issue a statement proposing that both sides withdraw forces, and then the [North] Korean government would express their agreement and support [for this proposal]. We agreed to adopt the first measure. Therefore, we produced a proposal for withdrawing the [People’s] Volunteer ArmyVolunteer Army from [North] Korea. (The above described proposal was personally handed [to Pavel Yudin].) We wish [to hear] the opinion of the Central Committee of the CPSU and the [Soviet] government before replying to Premier Kim Il Sung. We plan to hold the National People’s Congress from January 25 until early February, and therefore a delegation of our government will plan to visit [North] Korea in late February.Yudin: I will immediately report the above situation back to my country.[...]\n",

By the first of November a regiment was formed using 26 Korean pilots that have been trained and 24 Yak-9 planes that are located in Andong.2. On November 1 of this year, 8 planes of this regiment went into battle for the first time, in the region of ANJU. As a result of this flight 2 B-29 planes and a Mustang were downed. Two Yak-9's did not return from the battle.The first report from comrade Belov to me about the loss of the two Yak-9 planes in a battle in the region of ANDONG-SINUIJU was thus imprecise.The losses relate to a battle in the region of ANJU.3. In a battle on November 1 of this year, in the region of ANDONG-SINUIJU , two F-82 planes were downed by our pilots in MIG-15's and two planes were downed by anti-aircraft artillery. In all 4 planes [were downed].We had no losses in the air battle.4. MIG-15's of Comrade Belov flew from air bases at MUKDEN [SHENYANG] and ANSHAN. In all, 8 sorties were made from each airport. 5. At present there are 16 battle [as opposed to training] Yak-9's at the air base at ANDONG. In an attack on the Andong airport on 1 November 1950 one Yak-9 was burned and 3 were put out of action, but it is possible to restore them. In addition, 2 planes were lost while patrolling.In all 22 planes and 2 planes did not return from the region of ANJU.In addition to the Yak-9's there are:a) 6 PO-2 planes, which are fully combat ready and are carrying out night missions. There are 14 pilots, and from the 15 PO-2 available, 5 planes crashed during landings and takeoffs at the airfield itself and 4 planes were lost while on missions.b) 25 pilots for IL-10 planes, but up to now there are no planes for them.6. The command of the mixed air division of Koreans in ANDONG has been formed. It is headed by General LI FART.7. Comrade PETRACHEV asks about the possibility of receiving 25 Il-10 planes and 10 PO-2 planes.[S.E.] ZAKHAROVNo. 27022.11.50Report: No. 5228 of 2.11.50 asked Comrade Zakharov about the fact that there are discrepancies between his report and Belov's report about the air battle in the region of Andong. He was ordered to elucidate this discrepancy and report about the participation of Korean planes in battles and about the fact that two of them did not return. \n",

The troops lack ammunition and fuel the delivery of which has been virtually halted. The accounting for the available weapons and ammunition is organized unsatisfactorily. The top-down command and control system is set up poorly. The wire and radio communications work intermittently because of the interruptions inflicted by the enemy's air raids and due to the lack of qualified radio operators and the lack of fuel for radio station generators correspondingly. Courier mail is almost nonexistent.The predicament of the KPA troops, in particular on the Southeastern front, remains unclear.Upon our recommendation, on the night of 26.9.50 [26 September 1950], some Korean communications officers were dispatched to the Front Command and the Seoul group in order to collect information on the troops' situation.On 25.9.50, at 19:00 pm, local time, Kim Il Sung's order was forwarded to the troops, according to which the Seoul grouping and the Second Army Group operating in the northern part of the southeastern front were told to go on the defensive and hold up the enemy by any means.The troops of the Second Army Group operating in the central and southern parts of the southeastern front were ordered to begin general retreat northwestward with the aim of getting to the area of Jincheon, Daejon, Boeon for further leveling off the front line approximately following the line Seoul, Yeosu, Cheongju, Bonghwa, Uljin [in Russian translation: Seoul, Reisiu, Tsiusiu, Naidzio, Urutsin].On 26.9.50, KIM IL SUNG received our group.The meeting was also attended by Foreign Minister PAK HEON-YEONG [Pak Hon Yong] and Comrade SHTYKOV.As a result of our conversation, KIM IL SUNG decided to combine the duties of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief and Defense Minister in his hands, to set up a Staff Office for the Supreme Commander-in-Chief for the command and control over troops, and to pay serious attention to the work of the rear.At present, they have begun to form only six infantry divisions in the northern part of Korea, whereas the current military situation has made impossible the formation of nine infantry divisions manned with the Southerners.KIM IL SUNG issued a directive to take immediate steps aimed at withdrawing the remaining KPA troops from South Korea so that to use it to form new divisions in North Korea and deny this opportunity to the South.In connection with the fact that the Chinese railroads are overloaded transporting supplies to Korea, it is desirable that the armaments designated for use by the six divisions which are being newly formed be shipped first, and only then should the ammunition be delivered.After our conversation with KIM IL SUNG we got down to work in order to assist in:- organizing good command and control over troops;- rearranging the system of troop supplies, shipments, and transport services;- preparing defensive fortifications. The People's Army is experiencing a dire shortage of drivers. The 3,400 trucks which are to arrive soon have no drivers at all. It may be expedient to propose to Kim Il Sung that he ask the Chinese friends to dispatch not less than 1,500 drivers to Korea, may it not?MATVEYEV [ZAKHAROV]# 1298/sh09/27/5012:35pm, Pyongyang timeTyped by Budanova on 28.9.50 at 0:15 a.m.\n",

      "(Top Secret)To the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Report to Zhou Enlai and the Central Committee: I called upon [Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav M.] Molotov this afternoon, conveying to him the preliminary opinions of and preparation work on our side for the Geneva Conference. He says that all opinions are very good, and he will forward them to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union Central Committee and the [Soviet] Foreign Ministry for discussion. He also welcomes the delegations from China, [North] Korea, and Vietnam to visit Moscow in mid-April, to have discussions and consultations on various issues before (the Geneva Conference). Concerning Ho Chi Minh's plan to visit Moscow, he will report to the Central Committee immediately and will then give us a reply. During the conversation, Molotov touched upon several questions, and they can be used as reference for us at home. (1) At the Geneva Conference, apart from discussing the Korea and Vietnam questions, should such questions as relaxing tensions in Asia (including the Taiwan question, opposition to rearming Japan, and opposition to the US-Pakistan pact) also be discussed? He says that these issues should be considered. (2) Concerning plans for settling the Korea issue, should the issue of North Korea and South Korea “organizing a provisional government for the whole of Korea on the basis of equal rights” be raised? This should be given further consideration. He says that prior to 1950 the Soviet Union had used [the principle of] “on the basis of equal rights” with regard to the German question, but has not used it since then. This is because this statement is likely to cause many new and difficult problems. He says that he has heard that [Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) Prime Minister] Kim Il Sung does not welcome free elections.(3) Concerning the participation of foreign ministers from various countries, this [issue] was not clearly defined by the Berlin Conference. Molotov has consulted with several foreign ministers, and they have shown an interest in attending the conference. But they have attached a condition to this: it is possible that they may only attend the conference's opening ceremony, or may attend only part of the conference.(4) At the Geneva Conference, the countries which will be invited to participate in discussions of the Korea question have been agreed upon by all in advance. However, the countries which should be invited to participate in discussions of the Indochina question have not been worked out. It is likely that there will be disputes on this issue. As to whether India should be invited, Molotov says that he is not interested in this matter at the moment, as India's participation may weaken the role played by China at the Geneva Conference.(5) Concerning the organization of the conference, according to [United Nations (UN) Secretary General Dag] Hammarskjold, the institution of the United Nations can be used. However, Molotov emphasizes that the United Nations should not be allowed to get involved and that members of various delegations should be able to use their own institutions, just like the situation during the Berlin Conference.(6) Molotov says that the Soviet Union will start the preparatory work in the near future, and those involved will probably include [Soviet First Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei A.] Gromyko, [Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vasily V.] Kuznetsov, [Soviet Foreign Ministry Collegium Member Nikolai T.] Fedorenko, and [K.V.] Novikov, head of the Southeast Asian Department [of the Soviet Foreign Ministry].(7) Concerning the procedure question of the conference, he believes that there will be many disputes over it after the beginning of the conference.(8) Comrade Molotov will ask Comrade Gromyko and others to make presentations to us on matters needing attention in attending an international conference.Zhang Wentian6 March [1954]\n",

      "(Top Secret) Chairman Mao [Zedong], Comrade [Liu] Shaoqi, and the Central Committee: (1) We have agreed with the Soviet comrades in the last two days that we should let the Korean delegation speak first. Moreover, in their first speech the Korean delegation should present the plans to reunify Korea by peaceful means, withdraw all foreign troops, and oblige major countries (who are directly involved in the war) to ensure and help to bring about Korea's peaceful reunification. China and the Soviet Union should, in turn, express their support for the Korean delegation's positions one day after they speak. Therefore, I should also make a comprehensive statement myself. Right now I am reorganizing the drafts of the opening speech and two statements supporting the Korean delegation, and making changes based on several suggestions from the Soviet comrades. We will also present the principles for an Asian peace charter. However, we will not emphasize the Indochina issue for the moment since we hope to concentrate on the Korean issue in the first discussion. It will also demonstrate that we are not the people who are eager to negotiate. (2) Regarding the issue of the chairman of the conference, we have already consulted with the Soviet Union and Britain in advance and decided that Thailand, the Soviet Union, and Britain should take the chair in turn. Thailand already acted as the interim chair when this afternoon's meeting started at 3:00 p.m. Afterwards, the United States proposed that the above three countries take turns as chair. It was instantly put to vote and adopted. The meeting was adjourned thereafter. This meeting took only 15 minutes. Speeches and discussion will start tomorrow. (3) Today Molotov introduced [British Foreign Secretary Anthony] Eden to me at the meeting. He shook my hand and greeted me. Zhou Enlai 26 April [1954]\n",

      "To Chairman Mao [Zedong] and the Central Committee:[1]This afternoon, Nikolai Fedorenko (Director of the Far East Division), on behalf of Comrade [Foreign Minister] Andrey Vyshinsky, asked for the working agenda of our delegation. In accordance with the two reports described in the Chairman’s telegram to Filippov [Stalin] as well as procedural opinions about addressing the various issues under discussion, I explained that I only have some suggestions. Perhaps it would be better to wait for Comrade Stalin to consider them first and then ask Vyshinsky to make the appropriate arrangements.First on our agenda we propose a visit with Comrade Stalin to describe in brief the reports that we will make and the discussions we will have. Then we will ask Comrade Stalin to give instructions. If necessary, please designate several comrades to discuss specific issues with us.If possible, that day I would like to talk about the Korean War and the international situation, and then arrange another appointment to report on the most important developments in China during the past three years and our overall guidelines for construction during the next five years.During the talks, the delegation plans to visit Chairman Nikolay Shvernik and pay tribute to Lenin. After the meetings, the delegation plans to visit Stalingrad and the Volgaton Canal.Finally, we would like to visit comrades of the Central Committee of the Communist Party [of the Soviet Union] to discuss the organization and working methods of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.At 6 pm, I asked [Chinese Ambassador to the USSR] Zhang Wentian to visit Foreign Minister Vyshinsky. Vyshinsky said that the work agenda I suggested was very reasonable. He said that many people liked the speech yesterday when we arrived at the airport.Regarding the international situation, he said the US, in order to increase international tensions, would drag out the Korean War for some time to come. If it drags on for another two years, the situation will get even worse for the US and NATO will near collapse. The United States is now both afraid of peace and afraid to fight. Colds and fevers are widespread on the Korean battlefield. It is a cold and fever disease on the Korean battlefield. If a world war does not break out in five years, we will be very much different. The conversation with Vyshinsky indicates that they are already mentally prepared to assist in China's construction.Zhou Enlai August 18 at 20:00[1] The editors of Jianguo yilai Zhou Enlai wengao (Zhou Enlai’s Manuscripts since the Founding of the PRC) included several footnotes in this document that provided biographical information on the individuals mentioned.

The UK and France are very afraid of getting involved in a war with China, so are anxious.  America wants to fool [us] into an armistice so as to stabilize the front and augment its military strength in order to attack again.  Now they are worried, but we are not.  You should take the offensive.  Whenever you meet people who say North Korea should sheath the sword, do not refuse negotiations.  You can respond that, as soon as the American armies withdraw from Korea, the Korean War will cease by itself.  [You can also say] you are willing to report their opinions to Beijing.  To all who say that the Taiwan issue cannot be solved now, you should concentrate on this [point] to prove that the American imperialists’ invading North Korea and invading Taiwan are one and the same thing, and ask in reply: if the American imperialists can invade Taiwan while invading North Korea, why can’t the Chinese people assist North Korea while resisting America’s invasion of Taiwan?  In a word, you should not separate the invasion of Taiwan from the invasion of North Korea; you should not accuse [the US] of the invasion of Taiwan only while avoiding a direct answer on the North Korea [issue], should not always declare that your main task is to accuse [the US] of the invasion of Taiwan, and (should not) be afraid that talking about the North Korea issue will force us into the defendant’s position.  It should not be like this.  You should talk about the North Korea issue and the Taiwan issue with great confidence, proving at every opportunity that the American imperialists are invading North Korea and Taiwan; the UN resolution is illegal, and not allowing us to participate in the UN is disregarding 475 million Chinese people.  You should not avoid an oppositional stance in negotiations.  On the contrary, we should declare at every opportunity that no issue related to China can be solved without the Chinese joining the discussion and without the approval of Chinese representatives, therefore, any resolution [passed] or measure taken [without China’s involvement] is invalid and illegal.Zhou EnlaiSeven o’clock, December 3 [1950]\n",

      "Chairman [Mao Zedong]:Concerning all the questions raised by Peng [Dehuai] at 18:00 on [December] 8, and according to the results of two days of discussions, the following is the detailed report:(1) New recruits, 110,000 people in the Northeast have been concentrated.  Based on tonight’s phone call with Gao [Gang], he thinks that [if they are] trained by mid-January, 65,000 people can be supplied to the front. I told [him] to prepare 70,000 people. In accordance with the Chairman’s instructions over the phone tonight, if [we] can search and annihilate several sections of the enemy in areas not far from Seoul, then [we] should carry on fighting this campaign.  Otherwise, regardless of whether the enemy tenaciously defends Seoul or gives it up, our army should rest and regroup for a period of time. So when the new recruits are moved to the front in mid-January, it is precisely the opportune moment. The method of distribution should be according to Peng’s telegram: add 45,000 people to the west line, add 20,000 people to the east line, in addition, add 5,000 people to the 19th Army.  It will be better if cadres can be sent to the rear areas to strengthen management and training work after the end of the next campaign.2. The completion of replenishment of all military supplies needed by the 28th Army and other army organizations (including bedding, clothing, shoes and hats, army provisions and ammunition, plus improved light cannons) is guaranteed by the end of December.  If the Soviet rifles, light and heavy machine guns and tommy guns can be rushed over in time, the 19th Army can change uniforms as they pass through the Northeast in mid-January, and then can depart for the front.3. It will be mid-February until Liu [Bocheng]’s and Deng [Xiaoping]’s three armies arrive in the Hebei area. It will be late February by the time [they] finish replenishing their equipment.  It will be after January when [we] make a final decision about whether this part of the armed forces will be used in North Korea. So [we] intend to wait until the end of the next campaign to decide whether the Soviet-style infantry weapons from the Soviets (for 36 divisions) should be supplied to these three armies or to the Volunteer armies at the front, besides being given to the 19th Army.4. Concerning the repair of railways and transportation, Lü Zhengcao, Liu Juying and Yu Guangsheng came to an agreement that it could be guaranteed that, by December 20th, the Ji’an-Qiuchang-Soonchon-Pyongyang line will be repaired; due to the lack of bridge-building materials for two rail bridges, the Andong-Dingzhou-Sineuiju--Pyongyang line cannot be repaired fully until the goods come from Soviet Union in January or February.  The Pyongyang to Seoul line and Suncheon to Wonsan line both cross the Taedong River. [We] do not know the condition of the bridges and are now in the process of sending out personnel for reconnaissance.  Today, two bridge [repair] groups were sent out from inside the Shanhaiguan pass to the Northeast, for transfer to North Korea.  All transferable domestic repair equipment will be supplied on an expedited basis to the front.  It has been decided through consultation that tractors for clearing away blocked tunnels and cranes will be arranged by the Northeast.  Based on this situation, the Chian to Pyongyang line can act as the main supply line, but the amount that can be transported is smaller than that of the Sineuiju--Pyongyang line.  The two lines from Sineuiju- to the north of the Sineuiju- bridge and to Kuandian, through Suju to Tinju, currently can only be supplementary supply lines.  After [things] arrive at Sineuiju-, [they] will be taken over and transported forward by cars.  [The areas] east of Suncheon and south of Pyongyang are also like this.  After the bridge groups arrive at North Korea, if they can manage to build temporary bridges at the Cheongcheon River and the Taedong River, the difficulties can be reduced and vehicles can then move forward.  Another difficulty is that the enemy planes drop delayed-fuse bombs along the railways, which obstructs us from rush repairs and rush transportation at night.  For this, the railway engineering corps is studying methods to remove the bombs. 5. The air force is sending people to North Korea to investigate the condition of airports. If there is no jet-aircraft landing field in Pyongyang and other places, or there are damaged ones, [we] will have to wait for the [outcome of the] investigation before we know whether this kind of airport can be rush-repaired this winter.  If there is no such airport, [we] will have to wait for the [outcome of the] investigation before we know whether this kind of airport can be rush-built this winter. If there is no such airport, neither our air force nor the Soviet air force will be able to take off from Pyongyang. [The air forces] can only be at Andong, covering the transportation to Pyongyang and nearby areas to the south.  If too far [to the south], the return trip will take close to one hour, which will leave no extra time for fighting.  In January and February, we can dispatch four regiments of 120 jet chasers to provide air cover for transportation.  When the time comes, [we will] also need two Soviet regiments of chasers to coordinate the operations in order to feel confident of success.  Whether this can be done or not, is still dependent on negotiations.  By mid-April, our air force will have five regiments of jet chasers, one regiment of R11 chasers, two regiments of attack planes and four regiments of bombers, for a total of twelve regiments of 360 planes that can undertake operations.  But the decisive condition is that North Korea must have enough airports for chasers to take off and land.  By the end of next year, we can have a maximum of twenty-five regiments of jet chasers, three regiments of R9 and R11 chasers, four regiments of attack planes, seven regiments of bombers and four regiments of transport planes, for a total of forty-three regiments of 1290 planes.  Based on this estimate, simply staying within the country without fighting, airports with a value of 2,000 million jin of rice must be built and 180,000 tons of aviation fuel and kerosene must be consumed.  Not even factoring in other expenditures, this has already reached the maximum of what we can allocate for the development of the air force and for railway transportation and oil storage for the air force.  Therefore, considering [our] current material base, air force numbers can only reach this level next year and the speed can only be like this. 6. In mid-February, the artillery can send 37 mm. antiaircraft gun battalions (one battalion for every division) to the front.  The two artillery divisions that have been at the front can be strengthened.  Other artillery units cannot be used until March or April.  Detailed plans are still being worked out.7. [Concerning] tank units, four regiments can be dispatched in mid-March, four regiments can be dispatched in mid-April and every regiment [will have] 40 heavy and medium-sized tanks.8. After investigation of the airport situation, the headquarters of the air force can station its command post towards the front.  Some of the personnel from the current frontline artillery headquarters can be left for the special forces to set up a command post at the front.Zhou EnlaiNight of December 12 [1950]Chairman [Mao Zedong]:Concerning all the questions raised by Peng [Dehuai] at 18:00 on [December] 8, and according to the results of two days of discussions, the following is the detailed report:(1) New recruits, 110,000 people in the Northeast have been concentrated.  Based on tonight’s phone call with Gao [Gang], he thinks that [if they are] trained by mid-January, 65,000 people can be supplied to the front.

      "Wu [Xiuquan] [and] Qiao [Guanhua]:Have received your telegram from 16:00, [December] 11.  It is right for you to postpone your meeting with the Indian representative.  But when Rau asks to meet again, [you] should still see him once.  Yesterday I received Panikkar in Beijing and told him that we always insist on solving the North Korea issue peacefully and now are more willing to make great efforts to quickly end the military operations the Chinese People’s Volunteer Army and the North Korea People’s Army were compelled to take to resist the American invasion.  It is good that the Indian government is making great efforts for peace, however, it has not been entrusted [to do so] by either America or the UN.  Now what counts the most to end the war quickly is the USA.  We are eager to know the whole opinion of the USA and the UN regarding conditions for an armistice.  The Indian ambassador can make great efforts in this regard.  As to the 38th Parallel issue, it has long since been violated by the American invading armies and MacArthur, and is no longer in existence.  Panikkar expressed agreement to this fact right away.  I also pointed out that, at that time, many of the thirteen countries followed the USA, especially the Philippines, whose armies followed the USA in invading [the North].  Now the Philippines has also proposed an armistice, but their true intention is very clear.  The content of the above conversation, and especially the issue of the 38th parallel no longer being in existence, can be conveyed to Rau when you see him.Regarding the thirteen countries’ experimental proposal, if they come to inquire about it, you can tell them that an armistice should not be a fraud, but should be able to truly end the Korean War.  Thus, it must require the USA to state clearly its opinion on the armistice conditions and see whether it wants to continue the war and expand the war or end the war.  So if the gentlemen representatives from all countries hope to truly end the Korean War, [they] should call for what the Soviet representative has proposed: that all foreign armies withdraw from North Korea, instead of anything else.Zhou EnlaiDecember 13 [1950]\n",

      "Wu [Xiuquan [and] Qiao [Guanhua]:Have received your telegram from 3 o’clock, [December] 14.  Your answers to the two questions posed by Lie were very good.  But be careful, as Lie is completely a US spy.  According to intelligence, he even rejected the modest pressure that the UK imperialists wanted him to put on the US imperialists.  So [we] must guard against his stirring up trouble for the relationship between China and Asia and China and Arabic countries.  You’d better have a talk with Rau directly.  If there a chance to meet with Andy Jean of Iran, [you] can also make clear our attitude directly.  For the content of the talks, besides basing [yourself] on the principles stated in our three telegrams of December 8, 13, and 14, and the position you held when responding to Lie, you can also adopt Malik’s attitude towards the twelve countries (not including the Philippines) on the Political Committee of the UN General Assembly.  Emphasize in your explanation that we earnestly hope to make great efforts to end the Korean War as soon as possible.  But only negotiations based on our proposal can bring about a true armistice.  And the UN General Assembly Resolution on [December] 14 is not only illegal and invalid because representatives from our country did not participate or agree, but also the armistice in the first place and the negotiations on this only suit the needs of the USA and UK bloc of continuing the invasion of Korea and the invasion of Taiwan, bombing China and threatening Asia and world peace. We absolutely cannot agree with this kind of fake armistice and also ask that the gentlemen representatives who truly hope for peace and people over the world who love peace to try to distinguish truth from falsehood and distinguish clearly between right and wrong .If representatives of our country are deprived of the right to speak at the Political Committee discussion accusing the USA of invading China, agree to distribute the text of the speech at the press conference.Zhou EnlaiDecember 16 [1950]\n",

      "(Top Secret) Chairman Mao, Comrade [Liu] Shaoqi, and the Central Committee: (1) Comrade Molotov flew back to Moscow on the morning of the 30th [of May 1954]. He has already arrived today. On the afternoon of the 30th, the Chinese and the Soviet sides discussed their estimation of general situation of the conference. Molotov had met with Eden before he left. Regarding the Korean issue, Eden is inclined towards holding small meetings, to present proposals on general principles. Molotov did not accept that, nor did he refuse immediately at the time. He said that there should be a conclusion of the Korean issue so that it could consolidate the situation of the armistice in Korea to benefit peace. Eden agreed with that. We believe that we can hold restricted sessions. [We should] put aside [Republic of Korea Foreign Minister] Pyun Yung Tai's proposals and solely discuss basic principles for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and seek common ground for both sides so that we can reach some agreements. [We should present our proposal] as we presented the six-point proposal on the Indochina issue in order to make it more difficult for our counterparts to reject it completely. If our counterparts reject it completely, they are obviously unreasonable. After that it will be natural to let Nam Il present the second plan from our side. The Soviet friends basically agree with our opinions, and we also discussed them with and obtained approval from Comrade Nam Il. We have already formulated our own draft agreement for our side's principled agreement (see attachment). Concerning the Indochina issue, Molotov told Eden that after the six points of our proposal reached principled agreement or after discussing some political issues, the foreign ministers can return first and let the delegates stay to supervise and urge on the negotiations of the representatives of both sides' commanders. Eden agreed with that as well. He has already let the media know. We believe that it will take at least two weeks for the conference to accomplish the above tasks. Eden believes that the first two points of our six-point proposal regarding the principles of complete ceasefire and delimitation have already been solved through the resolutions passed on the 29th. Our counterparts want to discuss in particular the following four points, especially the issues concerning international supervision and international guarantee.(2) At the ninth restricted session on the Indochina issue on the 31st, our counterparts presented the issue of international supervision, as we expected. [Although] Smith did not present the issue of United Nations supervision at the meeting, he emphasized that the experience of the NNSC on Korea was not good and argued that our side did not act in good faith. He said that Poland and Czechoslovakia obstructed the NNSC's work and made it impossible for the NNSC to carry out its work in communist[-controlled] areas. Smith especially emphasized that communist countries could not be neutral and cited several paragraphs from the letters that Switzerland and Sweden sent to the Military Armistice Commission on 4 May and 7 May to prove his argument. I immediately spoke to refute Smith's statement. I first explained that the [North] Korean and Chinese sides do follow the armistice agreement, and Poland and Czechoslovakia are impartial. Several reports of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission are agreed to by Poland, Czechoslovakia and India. The biased ones are the other two members: Switzerland and Sweden. I affirmed that the work of the Korean NNSC had been basically successful, although they had met difficulties, and their difficulties came from the side of the United Nations forces. I used facts listed in Poland's and Czechoslovakia's two reports on 15 April and 30 April to prove that the United Nations forces created [those] difficulties for the NNSC. My conclusion is that we can use the experience of the Korean NNSC for reference. I also made it clear that when we discuss the issue of supervision it should be done in relation to other points. Also, we should have a joint commission consisting of members of both belligerents to supervise [the ceasefire] and to take charge of the implementation of the provisions of the [armistice] agreement. Gromyko spoke to support China's six-point proposal and explained and affirmed it point by point. In speaking of the membership of the organization of neutral nations' supervision, Gromyko suggested that India, Poland, Czechoslovakia and Pakistan [should be the members]. Our counterparts did not respond to this on the spot. Bidault's statement had two main points: 1) The main task of the international supervision in Laos and Cambodia is to ensure the withdrawal of the invading Viet Minh troops, not to supervise the armistice. 2) The representatives of both sides join the work of the international supervision committee. However, the Neutral Nations Commission should have supreme authority over and lead the joint commission.Bidault also presented the issues of the composition of the NNSC and the authority to which the NNSC should be responsible. He hinted that the NNSC should be responsible to the United Nations. In addition to giving his support to Smith's proposal, the Cambodian delegate also repeated his shibboleth that regrouping zones do not exist in Cambodia and that the Chinese delegation's proposal applies only to Vietnam. Pham Van Dong spoke to refute Smith's argument that only non-Communist countries could be neutral countries and gave his support to the Chinese delegation's conclusion on the supervision issue. Pham Van Dong claimed at the meeting that he had already appointed [DRV Vice Defense Minister General] Ta Quang Buu as representative of the command. He also proposed that Ta Quang Buu's assistant meet with the French military representative on 1 June to discuss and decide technical questions, such as the date by which representatives of the commanders of both sides start working.(3) After the meeting, the Soviet, Vietnamese, and Chinese sides agreed to draft some principles concerning the joint commission, the NNSC, and the international guarantee in order to unify the understanding of the three delegations of our side. (4) There is no meeting today and we had outside conference activities. Eden invited me for dinner tonight. Bidault said that he wanted to meet with me outside the conference. However, he was afraid that the Americans would find out about this and asked [us] not to let the journalists know in advance. I already agreed with that and agreed to visit him tonight at 10:00 p.m. after Eden's banquet.Zhou Enlai 1 June 1954 \n",

      "1. [Excised by the Department of Archives of the PRC Ministry of Foreign Affairs.] 2. Yesterday, military representatives from both sides began contact. Preliminary agreements have been reached regarding the date and other procedures of formal talks by the representatives of commanders-in-chief of both sides. Formal talks will begin today. 3. Last night I attended the banquet held by Eden. Eden mainly mentioned four issues: a. Eden informally expressed [his opinion] that he did not support the participation of Poland and Czechoslovakia in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. He said that it would be better if the supervision was carried out by Asian countries. I said that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission on Korea consisted only of European countries, and that some people opposed it. A commission consisting entirely of Asian countries would have disadvantages (I gave the example that it would be inappropriate for China as an Asian country to have supervision of the Kashmir problem). This time around it would be best if the commission could include both Asian and European countries, as proposed by Gromyko. b. Eden expressed the wish that the representatives of the commanders-in-chief of both sides would open the maps and solve some specific problems. c. Eden asked whether the conference would come to a conclusion in ten to fifteen days. I replied that it would depend on the efforts by both sides to reach an agreement. d. Eden said that since the United Kingdom has [British Chargé d'Affaires in Beijing Humphrey] Trevelyan in Beijing, he hoped that China would send its counterpart of Trevelyan to the United Kingdom. I have agreed. 4. I visited Bidault at 10:00 yesterday evening. On the one hand, Bidault explained that he wanted to reach an agreement and not fight World War III; on the other hand, he threatened that if an agreement could not be reached, there would be danger. I pointed out that the danger would be intervention by the United States and the threat to China's security—these are the things that concern us the most. Bidault expressed his hope that the representatives of the commanders-in-chief of both sides could resolve some specific problems. He also emphasized that the issue of international supervision should be addressed as well. Although Bidault had said beforehand that he wanted to discuss some problems, he did not go deeply into the problems yesterday evening, nor did he bring up specific questions.

      "(Top Secret) Chairman Mao, Comrade [Liu] Shaoqi, and the Central Committee: (1) Yesterday morning, the Soviet, [North] Korean, and Chinese sides met and agreed that we should try to hold a plenary session on the Korean issue this week. [We will] let Nam Il refute [South Korean Foreign Minister] Pyun Yung Tai's proposal and statements by the other delegations that supported Pyun. Although I will also speak to refute Pyun, I will emphasize the necessity and effectiveness of the neutral nations' supervision of the all-Korean free elections. As I reported in a previous telegram, we are planning to let the Soviet side present the “draft agreement regarding basic principles for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue by the participating countries of the Geneva Conference.” (2) Yesterday, at the tenth restricted session on the Indochina issue, Bidault presented a comprehensive plan regarding the issue of the neutral nations' supervision. Its major points are as follows: 1.The NNSC has five functions:(a) to supervise the regrouping of troops; (b) to supervise the movement of troops; (c) to investigate incidents that violate the armistice agreement in non-military zones; (d) to supervise the prevention of new troops and arms being introduced across the borders of Indochina. However, this point is still not quite clear; (e) to supervise the issue of the release of POWs and civilian internees.2. The NNSC should set up local commissions and ad hoc subcommissions; the decisions of all levels of international commissions should be taken by a majority;3. The joint commission of both sides should function under the authority of the NNSC; 4. Regarding the issue of the composition of the NNSC, Bidault disagreed with Gromyko's proposal and said: [“] Communist countries cannot be neutral[”]. He also quoted from Chairman Mao's On New Democracy that “neutral is simply a deceiving word.” However, he did not say that he agreed with those countries. Bidault especially emphasized that what he had said should only apply to Vietnam since the mission and organizational style of neutral nations' supervision in Laos and Cambodia is different from that in Vietnam. Smith spoke and cited Switzerland and Sweden's letter to the Military Armistice Commission on 4 May (the original letter was distributed after the meeting) to explain that the United Nations forces did not violate the armistice agreement. The Korean NNSC was unable to carry out its work because of the two communist members' obstruction. He said that none of the communist countries could be considered neutral countries, nor could they take charge of supervision. Therefore, he opposed Poland's and Czechoslovakia's participation and was [only] willing to accept India and Pakistan [as members of the NNSC]. I spoke immediately to refute Smith's statement and cited Poland's and Czechoslovakia's letters dated 15 April, 30 April, 8 May, and 20 May as proof (the original letters were distributed after the meeting). I expressed my support for Gromyko's proposal and pointed out that [we] should not confuse the non-neutrality of political thoughts with neutral nations that have not participated in the [Indochina] war. Eden made a statement and insisted that we should use Bidault's plan as a basis for discussion. He suggested that we should set up a technical committee to discuss the issues of functions and structure of the NNSC. Eden also suggested that the NNSC should be composed of Asian nations and emphasized that the joint commission of both sides should be subject to the command of the NNSC. Molotov spoke to refute Smith's statement[:] “if Smith basically opposes communist countries joining the NNSC it means that he does not want to settle the problem. This attitude hampers the settlement. Such an attitude that denies all non-capitalist countries a role in the NNSC is close to the thoughts of the anti-communist league.” Molotov also cited documents signed jointly by four member countries of the Korean NNSC acknowledging that the United States violated the [armistice] agreement. However, [he] explained that the NNSC was still effective despite these weaknesses and that the four countries could reach an agreement. The four neutral countries that the Soviet Union proposed included two Asian countries and two European countries. Among those countries, two of them had diplomatic relations with France and the other two with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. They will be able to reflect the opinions of both sides. (3) Our counterparts have not yet reached a consensus on the issue of the composition of the NNSC. They were unable to make any suggestions at the meeting. Based on newspaper [accounts], it seems that France does not agree with the Southeast Asian countries completely. (4) I will report the situation at yesterday's first formal meeting of the representatives of commanders of both sides in a separate telegram. Zhou Enlai 3 June 1954 \n",

      "Chairman Mao, Comrade [Liu] Shaoqi, and the Central Committee: (1) Bao Dai's delegate said at yesterday's eleventh restricted session on the Indochina issue that only the United Nations could take charge of the task of supervising. Bidault spoke to support Bao Dai's delegate and said: [“] the NNSC should be responsible to the United Nations.[”] In addition to repeating that the organization of the joint commission of both sides cannot apply to Laos and Cambodia, Bidault also emphasized that the joint commission should function under the authority of the NNSC so that the NNSC can serve as a judicial [organization]. However, since [the members of] the joint commission are parties concerned [in the war]; parties concerned cannot act as judges at the same time. Therefore, the joint commission can only function as a tool and cannot take major responsibilities for supervision. Smith stated the US preference for the United Nations as supervisory authority. However, he said that he probably will not assert this. Smith said: [“] four countries, Switzerland, Sweden, India, and Pakistan are suitable to take charge of supervising, however, [China, the Soviet Union, and Vietnam] must disagree [”]. He suggested that the two chairmen should discuss the issue of composition in private. I made statements not only resolutely opposing the United Nations supervision, but also pointing out that the relationship between the NNSC and the joint commission should be equal. The NNSC was by no means to be over the joint commission. Since the two belligerent sides are the main parties concerned, whether or not the armistice agreement can be carried out depends on both sides' sincerity. The joint commission of both sides should take major responsibility. The division of work between the two is: the function of the joint commission is to supervise the implementation of the provisions of the armistice; meanwhile, the function of the NNSC is to supervise and inspect whether or not the two sides have violated the provisions of the armistice agreement. The NNSC's functions either inside or outside Indochina will be two-fold: one is to supervise demilitarized areas; the other is to supervise throughout Indochina and along common frontiers with other countries the prohibition of introducing new troops, military personnel, and arms and ammunition, whether by land, sea, or air. Thus within Indochina there would be two kinds of organizations working together. However, the NNSC will be directly responsible for supervising along the borders. Regarding the issue of to whom the NNSC should report, I pointed out that I agreed with Bidault's original proposal to let the nine [conference] participants guarantee. Chairman Eden agreed to discuss the issue of the composition of the NNSC in private. He stated that a restricted session on the Indochina issue will be held today and a plenary session on the Korean issue on the 5th. The 6th is [Sunday]. A restricted session on the Korean issue will be held on the 7th and a plenary session on the Indochina issue on the 8th.(2) The Soviet, Vietnamese, and Chinese sides are discussing issues concerning the functions of the members of the joint commission and the NNSC, the relationship between the two committees, and the international guarantee. We are also drafting detailed provisions now. I will report later after we have made decisions. Zhou Enlai 4 June 1954 \n",

      "Chairman Mao, Comrade [Liu] Shaoqi, and the Central Committee: (1) Our counterparts did not refer to the issue of United Nations supervision at yesterday's twelfth restricted session because of our resolute opposition on the 3rd. What I referred to on the 3rd concerning the issue of the functions and authorities of the joint commission, of the NNSC and of the international guarantee [commission], and the issue of the relationship among these three bodies have already caught our counterparts' attention. Eden said yesterday that my proposal that the NNSC should be responsible to the Geneva Conference participants who have the task of guaranteeing the agreements is worthy of careful consideration. Eden also suggested that the participants should set up a permanent [supervisory] organization. Bidault stated that the French proposal has something in common with mine and hinted that he agreed with Eden on the establishment of a permanent organization. Bidault said that impartial arbiters are needed. He emphasized that the neutral organization must have the authority of supervision and a great number of staff. Bidault also reiterated his two original opinions[:] the joint commission should be subordinate to the NNSC; the current proposal concerning supervision should only apply to Vietnam and the supervision of Laos and Cambodia needs to be decided separately. See attachment for Bidault's original proposal. Smith spoke next and did not oppose the conference participants joining in [the international] guarantee. However, he still emphasized that the NNSC should have superior authority over the joint commission. Regarding my proposal, Smith said: [it] simply will be a framework for agreements that this conference might reach. However, we must solve two problems first:1. the impartial composition of the international supervisory commissions;2. the nature of the obligations of the countries who participate in guaranteeing the agreements.Molotov spoke and agreed that the NNSC should be responsible to the Geneva [Conference] participants who join in the international guarantee. He also pointed out that the agreement by both belligerents has decisive meaning in solving the conflict. The joint commission can also play an important role. Therefore, it should not be subordinate to outside power. In addition, no such subordination exists [in case of the joint bodies representing the belligerents] in Korea. Molotov also refuted three points of [our counterparts'] arguments:1. If, as [our counterparts] said, communist countries cannot be neutral and can only constitute one side [of the negotiations], then capitalist countries cannot be neutral either. This argument violates the United Nations Charter since the UN Security Council, the Economic and Social Council, and the International Court of Justice are all composed of different countries of different political and economic systems.2. The United Nations has nothing to do with this conference. China, a country of half a billion people, and the majority of the participants of this conference are not members of the United Nations. Therefore, the United Nations should not take charge of international supervision. 3. The NNSC must cover not only Vietnam but also Laos and Cambodia. (2) Molotov put some pressure on our counterparts at yesterday's meeting since they delayed the establishment of contacts between the representatives of the two commands in the field and expressed hope that these would be established in the near future.(3) Eden went back to Britain last night. [The conference will] discuss the Korean issue today and next Monday. We will use these two, three days to revise our detailed proposal on the issues of the joint commission, the NNSC and the international guarantee. I will send another telegram to report again after the Soviet, Vietnamese and Chinese sides have made a decision. Zhou Enlai 5 June 1954 \n",

      "Chairman Mao, Comrade [Liu] Shaoqi, and the Central Committee: (1) At yesterday's plenary session on the Korean issue, we took steps to make the meeting a restricted one in which we could solve the problem. In order to do this, we took the initiative in adopting a conciliatory attitude and seeking subjects on which agreement could be reached. The Korean, Chinese, and Soviet delegations all spoke in the session. I have already sent back all three texts of the speeches. Nam Il stated that the DPRK was not opposed to the phased and proportional withdrawal of foreign troops. He cited the examples of the United States and Switzerland in order to refute his counterparts' arguments concerning the organization of an all-Korean government based on the proportional representation of populations. I spoke to emphasize that we could find common ground on which to settle the Korean issue peacefully. At the meeting, Molotov submitted his draft concerning ?basic principles and agreements on a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue.? Although I have already cabled the text of his draft, I need to add three more sentences to one of the sections. Specifically, ?elections should be held within six months after the conclusion of this agreement. Elections should be conducted by secret ballot based on the laws of universal suffrage. Representation in the all-Korean legislature should be in proportion to the population of Korea as a whole.? Since three statements from our side all indicated that we tried to seek common ground, the Dutch delegation said in their speech that they would examine Molotov's proposals immediately after he spoke.Smith and [ROK Foreign Minister] Pyun Yung Tai were afraid that our efforts to reach an agreement would have a positive influence on the conference. Pyun Yung Tai therefore made a special speech refuting Nam Il's arguments. Smith also spoke to attack my proposal for neutral nations' supervision [on elections in Korea]. He emphasized that elections must be supervised by the United Nations. He even hinted at last that he would use public opinion to threaten us. I immediately made a brief statement saying that we could not agree to Smith's explanation for the NNSC's role in the Korean issue. I also reserved my right to reply to other parts of Smith's statement to which we could not agree in the future. (2) According to the media, the 16 countries of the other side held a meeting yesterday in the morning. The United States intended to sabotage the negotiations on the Korean issue. However, other countries did not agree. Obviously, it is the United States that intentionally creates tension both inside and outside the conference. The Americans are trying to win support under the signboard of the United Nations. They are afraid that our side will undermine the United Nations' prestige, and that we will desperately oppose the exercise of veto over the issue of neutral nations. They are afraid that an organization of neutral nations on a footing of equality with both sides will be unfavorable to the United States. (3) In order to expose America's plot to sabotage [the conference], our side is preparing to provide further specific materials that affirm the achievements of the NNSC on the Korean issue and the effectiveness of the Four Nations' Agreement. We will also provide materials to prove that the United States violated the armistice agreement and disrupted the NNSC. Concerning the propaganda issue, we plan to compare our conciliatory attitude and America's disruptive one during the conference. It will show clearly that our side is trying its best to seek common ground. However, the United States is still insisting on United Nations supervision and is not willing to look for other channels beyond the United Nations to solve the problems. Zhou Enlai 6 June 1954 \n",

      "마오 주석, [류]샤오치 동지 및 중앙위원회: (1) 조선문제에 대한 어제 대표회의에서 우리는 문제를 해결할 수 있도록 회의를 보다 제한적으로 진행하였다. 우리는 회유의 태도를 취하며 합의가 이루어질 수 있는 주제를 모색하였다. 조선과 중국, 그리고 소련 대표단은 이 회의에서 모두 발언하였으며, 나는 이미 이 세 개 발언을 전송한 바 있다. 남일은 조선민주주의인민공화국이 외국군의 단계적, 비례적 철수에 반대하는 것이 아니라고 말했다. 그는 인구수에 비례하는 온전한 조선 정부 구성에 대한 반대의견에 반박하기 위해 미국과 스위스의 예를 들었다. 나는 조선의 문제를 평화롭게 해결할 수 있는 공동기반을 찾을 수 있음을 강조하며 발언하였다. 회의에서 몰로토브는 “조선 문제의 평화적 해결을 위한 기본원칙과 합의사항”에 대한 초안을 제출하였다. 이 문서는 이미 전송한 바 있으나, 한 부분에 세 문장 정도를 추가하려 한다. “이 합의가 이루어진 후 6개월 내에 선거가 이루어져야 한다. 선거는 보통선거의 원칙에 따라 비밀투표로 이루어져야 한다. 순수 조선 정부의 대표는 조선 전체의 인구수에 비례해야 할 것이다” 우리측의 세 개 발언이 공동 기반을 모색하고자 하는 의사를 비쳤기 때문에, 네덜란드 대표는 몰로토브의 제안을 즉시 검토하겠다고 발언하였다. 스미스와 [대한민국 외무부장관] 변영태는 합의를 이끌어내고자 한 우리의 노력이 회담에 긍정적인 영향을 줄까 두려워했다. 따라서 변영태는 남일의 주장에 반박하는 특별 연설을 하였다. 스미스 또한 나의 [조선의 선거에 대한] 중립국의 감독 제안을 공격하였다. 그는 선거는 국제연합이 감독해야 하는 것이라 강조하였다. 그는 심지어 우리를 위협하기 위해 여론까지 동원하겠다는 의도를 내비쳤다. 나는 즉시 간략히 성명을 내어 우리는 조선문제에 있어 NNSC의 역할에 관한 스미스의 설명에 동의할 수 없다고 발언하였다. 나는 한편 우리가 동의하지 않는 스미스의 발언에 대해 차후 대응할 수 있음을 밝혀두었다. (2) 대중매체에 따르면 반대측의 16개 국가는 어제 오전 회의를 개최했다고 한다. 미국은 조선문제에 관한 협상을 망치려는 의도였다. 그러나 기타 국가들이 이에 동의하지 않았다. 미국은 회의 안팎에서 의도적으로 긴장을 고조시키려는 것이 분명하다. 미국인들은 국제연합을 내세워 지지를 얻으려 노력하고 있다. 그들은 우리 측이 국제연합의 명망을 무너뜨리고 중립국 문제에 관한 거부권 행사에 기필코 반대할까 두려워한다. 그들은 양측을 포함하는, 평등에 기반한 중립국 조직이 미국에 불리하게 작용할까 두려워한다.(3) [회담을] 실패로 이끌려는 미국의 음모를 드러내기 위해 우리측은 조선문제에 관한 NNSC의 성과와 4국 협정 [Four Nations’ Agreement]의 효과를 밝힐 수 있는 확실한 증거를 제시하려 준비 중이다. 또한 우리는 미국이 정전협정을 위반하였으며 NNSC를 방해했다는 증거 또한 제출할 예정이다. 선전문제와 관련하여 우리는 우리의 회유적 태도와 미국의 비협조적 태도를 비교할 계획이다. 이를 통해 우리측이 공동기반을 모색하려 최선을 다하고 있다는 사실을 여실히 드러날 것이다. 반면 미국은 여전히 국제연합의 감독만을 주장하며 국제연합을 통하지 않은 문제해결은 고려하고자 하지 않는다. 1954년 6월 6일 저우언라이\n",

      "Chairman [Mao Zedong], Comrade [Liu] Shaoqi, and the Central Committee: In the evening of the 7th, Bidault visited me and discussed mainly the issue of neutral nation supervision. He stated that the nature of the Korean issue was different from that of the Indochinese issue so the precedent case of Korea did not apply to Indochina. He didn't agree that Poland and Czechoslovakia join the supervision of Indochina. Regarding the membership, he said that only India and Pakistan were neutral nations, and that a neutral nation should be identified and accepted by all sides. But he didn't mention any specific nation for a probe. During our conversations, Bidault expressed his willingness for peace, and he also hinted at us Anthony Eden and Zhou Enlai at the Geneva Conference (courtesy PRC Ministry of Foreign Affairs Archives) not to apply any military pressure. He said, “Don't worsen the military situation to slow progress. A military situation will cause negative political reactions. Do not continue the war while discussing peace, and do not use the war to antagonize the public feeling of the other side.” On one hand, Bidault said that he hoped to obtain a cease-fire under the condition that the historical relationship between France and the three countries, Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, was kept in mind. On the other hand, however, he said that he is opposed to mixing together discussion of military and political issues. Bidault also tried to find out [whether] a better chance for an agreement [would exist] if the Korean and Indochinese issues were discussed together or separately; and a possible result on the entire Asian issue if the discussions were conducted behind closed doors. I told him that the two issues certainly had impact on each other. They all should be solved, not just one, while leaving the other unsolved, or even trying to block any solution. Bidault said that he could avoid the impact of the development of the Indochinese issues on his government and media. He also said that, if necessary, he may have to mention his conversation with me in his speech that would be sent to the Assembly on Wednesday (the 9th). But he didn't state definitely that he would publicize this matter. He may want to use his contact with China to calm down the complaints in the Assembly, but he was afraid of upsetting America. Bidault also told me that he may have to talk aggressively and offensively at the public meeting on the 8th. He wanted to make a statement ahead that it “won't be a problem for me to continue the communication with the Chinese delegation thereafter.” During the conversation, Bidault emphasized that my opinion was very close to his. His conversations with me were more constructive than those with other people. I talked about the issues of neutral nation supervision, the experience of the Korean Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, and veto rights. I also emphasized that both sides should follow the conciliatory spirits and look for their common points.

      "(Top Secret) Chairman Mao [Zedong], Comrade [Liu] Shaoqi and the Central Committee: The delegations of six countries of the Western camp spoke at the open meeting on the Korean issue on the 11th. Six countries (France, with Britain and Canada taking the initiative among the other five countries and New Zealand, Belgium, and Thailand giving their support) stated unanimously that if the conference cannot reach any agreement on the Korean issue, it should be returned to the United Nations. Although Bidault is usually the least interested in the Korean issue, he suddenly became active at this meeting in order to obtain more votes when the French Parliament decides on the motion of confidence on the 12th. He returned from Paris and intentionally showed the spirit of conciliation in proposing five ambiguous principles at the plenary session on the Korean issue. In his proposals, Bidault briefly mentioned that elections should be held throughout the territory of Korea, and also raised the issues of the withdrawal of foreign forces and international supervision. However, instead of emphasizing the necessity of the United Nations' supervision, he simply said that “once the unification has been carried out under legitimate conditions, the UN should be called upon to give their sanction [to this settlement thus reached].” From our side, both Nam Il and I spoke and expressed our complete support of Molotov's five-point proposal presented on the 5th. We also proposed that the conference should adopt this proposal as the basis for further discussion. I not only fought back Smith's threatening statement on the 5th that he would appeal to world opinion, but also focused on exposing his plot to interrupt the negotiations. I pointed out that since both sides had already achieved agreement on several points and agreement might be possible on some other points, there was no reason for the conference not to continue. The current situation is that the United States and South Korea want to sabotage the negotiations on the Korean issue, however, other countries who attended the sixteen countries' meeting on the 4th did not agree. Since Molotov's five-point proposal on the 5th was full of the spirit of conciliation, it made it difficult for our counterparts to reject it completely. Therefore, the United States cancelled the planned restricted session on the Korean issue on the 7th. At the same time, the US is attempting to mold public opinion and is preparing to end the negotiations at the right moment. At the plenary session on the 11th, the United States therefore instigated the six countries to distort our arguments recklessly and to emphasize that the differences could not be resolved, and attempted to end the conference by proposing to return the Korean issue to the United Nations. However, through the six countries' delegations' statements, we perceived that there were still differences among them. Although all six countries defended the United Nations, five of them did not support Pyun Yung Tai's sixteen-point proposal directly. Neither was their support of the United States enthusiastic. Bidault's proposals were not quite in step with the other five countries' statements. Neither did he raise the issue of the United Nations' supervision. Bidault simply said that [the settlement of the Korean issue] should be reported to and obtain ratification from the United Nations. Therefore, it is still difficult for them to end the meetings on the Korean issue immediately. Our side plans to let Nam Il propose our second original plan in next week's meetings on the Korean issue.Zhou Enlai 13 June 1954 \n",

      "(일급기밀) 마오 주석, [류]샤오치 동지 및 중앙위원회:서구의 6개국 대표단이 11일 조선문제에 대한 개회식에서 발언하였다. 6개국(프랑스, 영국과 캐나다가 기타 5개국의 대표 성격을 취하며 뉴질랜드와 벨기에, 태국은 지지하는 입장)은 모두 이 회담이 조선문제에 대해 합의를 내지 못한다면 이 문제는 다시 유엔으로 귀환되어야 한다고 말했다. 비도 [Bidault] 는 보통 조선문제에 가장 관심이 없었는데, 프랑스 의회에서 12일 신임투표를 앞두고 보다 많은 표를 얻고자 이 회담에서 갑자기 적극적 태도를 나타낸 것이다. 그는 파리에서 돌아와 조선문제에 관한 대표회의에서 다섯 개의 모호한 원칙을 제안하며 의도적으로 회유적인 태도를 나타냈다. 비도는 이 제안에서 선거가 조선 전 영토에서 이루어져야 한다고 간략히 언급하였으며, 또한 외국군과 국제 감독권의 철수 문제를 언급하였다. 그러나 그는 유엔 감독의 필요성을 강조하기보다는 일단 통일이 합법적인 조건 하에 이루어지고 나면 유엔은 [이 방안에 대해] 허가해야 한다고 단순히 언급하였다. 우리 측에서는 나와 남일이 발언하여 5일 몰로토브가 발표한 5도 제안을 완전히 지지한다고 이야기하였다. 또한 우리는 이 회담이 제안을 채택하여 추가 논의를 진행할 것을 제안하였다. 나는 지난 5일 세계 여론에 호소하겠다는 스미스의 위협적 발언을 반박했을 뿐만 아니라 협상을 방해하려는 그의 음모를 드러내는 데에 집중하였다. 나는 양측이 이미 몇 개 의견에 대해 합의하였을 뿐만 아니라 기타 문제에 대하여도 합의가 가능할 것이라 지적하며, 회담이 지속되지 않아야 할 이유가 없다고 말했다. 현재 미국과 남조선은 조선문제에 관한 협상을 방해하고자 하는데, 4일 16개 국 회의에 참여하였던 기타 국가들은 이에 동의하지 않는다. 5일 발표된 몰로토브의 5도 제안이 화해의 의도로 가득했음에 따라 상대편 또한 이를 완전히 거부하기는 어려웠다. 따라서 미국은 7일 조선문제에 대한 제한적 회의 계획을 취소하게 되었다. 동시에 미국은 여론을 조작하여 적절한 시점에 협상을 종료시키려고 시도 중이다. 11일 대표회의에서 미국은 6개국이 우리의 의견을 무모하게 왜곡하고 차이가 극복되지 못할 것이라고 강조하며, 조선문제를 유엔에 되돌리자고 제안하며 회담을 종결하고자 했다. 그러나 6개국 대표단의 발언으로 인해 우리는 그들 사이에도 여전히 의견의 차이가 있음을 인식하게 되었다. 6개국 모두 유엔을 옹호하긴 했으나, 그 중 5개국은 변영태의 16도 제안을 직접적으로 지지하지 않았다. 미국에 대한 지지 또한 열렬하지 않았다. 비도의 제안은 기타 5개국 발언과 보조가 맞지 않았으며 유엔의 감독 문제를 꺼내지도 않았다. 비도는 단순히 [조선문제의 해결은] 유엔에 보고되고 비준을 얻어야 한다고만 말했을 뿐이다. 따라서 그들의 경우 조선문제와 관련된 회담을 즉시 종결하는 것은 불가하다. 우리측은 다음 주 조선문제에 관한 회담에서 남일이 우리의 두 번째 원안을 발표하도록 하는 것이다. 1954년 6월 13일저우언라이\n",

      "Chairman Mao [Zedong], Comrade [Liu] Shaoqi, and the Central Committee: (1) The Soviet, Korean, and Chinese delegations discussed our strategies on the Korean issue on the evening of the 14th. We assume that our counterparts will not accept the five-point proposal that Molotov presented on 5 June since they have already spread rumors outside the conference that the conference will be ended at the plenary session of the 15th. It will be difficult to present easily our side's second original plan (regarding the consolidation of peace in Korea) as well as the supplementary proposals that we originally planned to use as last steps. We must try to play every card we have at the last session. Even if we cannot prevent the conference from being sabotaged, we can at least drive our counterparts into an unfavorable position. The more modest our proposals are, the more passive our counterparts will be. It will also make it more difficult and more unreasonable of them to sabotage the conference. In addition, it will force our counterparts to take greater responsibility for ending the conference. Therefore we have decided that at the plenary session on the 15th, our side should: let Nam Il present proposals on the guarantee of peace in Korea; let me speak to support Nam Il's proposals and recommend that the conference should go into a restricted session of seven countries [China, the USSR, the UK, the US, France, the DPRK, and the ROK]; and let Molotov submit a [draft] declaration to guarantee that no action will be taken to threaten peace in Korea. We assume that our counterparts will accept none of these proposals. Therefore, at last, I will make a minimum proposal. Specifically, I will express our common desire for the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and propose to discuss the issues of time and place for the reopening of the negotiations. We presume that our counterparts will not even accept this minimum proposal since the United States' policy is basically not to reach any agreement.(2) At the fifteenth plenary session on the Korean issue on the 15th, Chairman Eden intentionally let our three delegations speak first. Nam Il made a six-point proposal on the guarantee of peace in Korea. I spoke to support Nam Il's proposals and suggested that the conference go into a restricted session of seven countries. Molotov proposed that the nineteen countries should publish a joint declaration assuring that no action will be taken to threaten the peace in Korea. It seems that Molotov's proposal for a joint declaration was beyond our counterparts' expectations. Thus, Eden immediately called for a short recess after our three delegations finished our speeches. The sixteen countries held an extraordinary meeting [during the recess] and requested an extension of the intermission. Although our counterparts did not reach a complete internal agreement at the time, the United States had already decided to sabotage the conference. Following the recess, our counterparts opposed discussing our side's proposals, and the Thai delegation presented the 16-nation joint declaration. They then declared the end of the conference. Molotov then made an overall statement on the Korean issue and pointed out that our counterparts should take the responsibility for sabotaging the conference. I spoke next and expressed my great regret that the 16-nation declaration announced its determination to end the conference. I then presented our minimum proposal. Specifically, that the nineteen countries should issue a joint statement indicating a common desire to achieve the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue on the basis of establishing a unified, independent, and democratic country of Korea. I pointed out that if they rejected this proposal, their rejection of negotiations could only have an unfavorable effect on future international conferences. This minimum proposal obviously threw our counterparts into confusion. After debating back and forth [among themselves], the Belgian delegate stated that he was not opposed to the spirit of my proposal and was ready to accept it. Eden agreed with the Belgian delegate's statement and asked the delegations if he could conclude that the conference had already accepted China's proposal. Nobody was responding at the time. Smith panicked and immediately took the floor himself with a statement against us. Eden then reversed himself and said that the conference had no procedure for voting. He pointed out that the conference would not be able to reach agreement on any of the proposals, and it was only possible to note the proposals as part of the record of the conference. I immediately praised the Belgian delegate's spirit of conciliation and said that it was also worth noting that Chairman Eden asked the delegations to consent to China's last proposal. At the same time, I criticized the opposition and obstruction of the US delegation and pointed out how the US delegation had been preventing the Geneva Conference from being able to arrive at even a minimal agreement. At the end Eden declared that the conference would note all proposals and statements as part of the record and that the meeting was adjourned. In sum, the Soviet, Korean, and Chinese delegations' repeated efforts disrupted our counterparts' arrangement and completely exposed America's decision to sabotage the conference.(3) At this point the sessions on the Korean issue ended. We are considering whether or not the Soviet Union, the DPRK, and China, the three countries of our side, should issue a joint statement or issue statements separately after we return to our countries summarizing the discussions on the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference and explaining them to the whole world.

      "마우쩌둥 의장, 류샤오치 그리고 중앙위원회:(1)14차 총회일 저녁, 소련, 조선, 그리고 중국대표단은 한반도문제에 대한 우리의 전략에 대해 논의했다. 15차 총회와 함께 회담도 끝날 것이라는 소문이 이미 퍼져, 6월 5일에 몰로토브가 발표한 5개 조항의 제안서가 수용되지 못할 것이라 추측하고 있다. 조선의 평화적 통일에 관한 우리의 2차 계획과 마지막 단계에 사용하려던 추가 제안 역시 쉽사리 발표할 수 있을 것 같지 않다. 우리가 가지고 있는 모든 대안을 마지막 세션에 내놓아야 할 것이다. 우리가 회담을 성공시키지는 못하더라도, 적어도 상대국을 불리하게 만들 수는 있다. 우리가 겸손하게 제안할수록 상대국은 더욱 신중하게 대응할 것이고, 이는 결국 회담을 방해하는 하는 것을 더욱 어렵고 불합리하게 보이도록 만들 것이다. 이로써 상대국들은 회담을 끝내는 것에 더욱 책임감을 갖게 될 것이다. 따라서 우리는 오는 15일에 있을 총회에서, 남일이 조선의 평화를 위한 제안서를 발표하면, 내가 남일의 제안서를 지지하면서 중국, 소련, 영국, 미국, 프랑스, 조선민주주의인민공화국 그리고 대한민국 7개국만 참석하는 제한적 세션을 마련하자는 의견을 제시하고, 몰로토브가 한반도의 평화를 위협하는 어떤 조치도 없음을 보장하는 선언 초안을 제출해야 한다는 결정을 내렸다. 우리는 상대국들이 이 중 어떤 제안도 받아들이지 않을 것이라 생각한다. 결국 내가 최소한의 제안을 낼 것이다. 특별히 한반도의 평화정착을 위한 우리의 공통된 요구사항을 전달하고, 협상의 속개를 위한 시간과 장소를 논의하자는 제안을 할 것이다. 미국의 방침이 기본적으로 어떤 협의에도 이르지 못하게 하는 것이므로, 우리는 이러한 최소한의 제안마저 받아들여지지 않을 것이라 예상한다.(2)15일에 있는 15차 총회에서, 이든 의장은 의도적으로 우리 3개국의 대표단을 먼저 호명했다. 남일은 한반도의 평화를 보장하는 6개 조항의 제안서를 만들었다. 나는 남일의 제안서를 지지하면서 본 회담이 7개국의 제한적 세션을 가져야 한다고 주장했다. 몰로토브는 19개국이 한반도의 평화를 위협하는 어떤 조치도 없을 것이라는 19개국의 공동성명을 발표할 것을 제안했다. 공동성명을 위한 몰로토브의 제안은 상대국이 예상치 못했던 것으로 보인다. 이든은 우리 3개국 대표단이 연설을 마치자 마자 휴회를 선언했다. 16개국은 휴회 중 예외적으로 회의를 갖고, 휴회시간의 연장을 요청했다. 상대국들은 그 시간 동안 합의를 도출하지 못했지만, 미국은 회담을 훼방하기로 그 이전에 이미 결정했다. 휴회 후, 상대국들은 우리의 제안을 반대하고, 태국 대표단은 16개국 공동선언을 발표했다. 그 다음으로 그들은 회담의 종결을 선언했다. 몰로토브는 한반도 문제에 대한 전반적인 발표를 하면서, 상대국들이 회담을 방해한 책임을 져야 한다는 점을 지적했다. 다음의 발언으로 나는 16개국의 회담종결 공동선언에 유감을 표하고, 우리의 최소한의 제안을 발표했다. 특히 19개국이 통일된, 독립적인, 민주적인 조선의 설립을 기본으로 하여 한반도 평화정착을 위한 공통적 요구를 담은 공동선언을 발표해야 한다고 했다. 나는 만약 그들이 이를 거절한다면 협상의 결렬은 향후의 국제회담에 악영향을 미칠 뿐이라는 점을 지적했다. 이 최소한의 제안은 명백히 상대국들을 혼돈에 빠트렸다. 그들 사이에서 한참의 논쟁이 벌인 후, 벨기에 대표단이 우리 제안의 정신에 반대하지 않고, 이를 받아들이겠다고 선언했다. 이든은 벨기에 대표단의 발언에 동의하면서, 이 회담에서 중국의 제안을 받아들이는 것으로 결론을 낸 것인지 대표단에게 물어봤는데, 당시에는 아무도 대답하지 못했다. 스미스는 놀라 즉시 반격했다. 이든은 발언을 취소하고, 회담에는 투표절차가 없다고 말했다. 그는 회담이 협의를 도출해 내지 못 할 수 있고, 회담기록으로서만 제안을 기록할 수 있다는 지적을 했다. 나는 즉시 회유하며 벨기에 대표단의 정신을 칭송했고, 이든 의장이 중국의 마지막 제안에 동의를 대표단에게 요청한 것으로 충분히 가치가 있다는 지적을 했다. 동시에 나는 미국대표단의 반대와 훼방을 비난하며, 미국대표단은 어째서 제네바 회담에서 최소한의 협의 도출을 방해를 하는지 지적했다. 마지막에 이든은 이 회담에서의 모든 제안과 선언을 기록할 것임을 말하고, 휴회를 선언했다. 요컨대, 소련과 조선 그리고 중국 대표단의 노력은 상대국을 교란하고 미국의 회담방해를 만천하에 알렸다.(3)현재 한반도사안의 세션은 종결됐다. 소련과 조선민주주의인민공화국 그리고 중국이 공동선언이나 혹은 개별 선언을 내어, 제네바 회담에서 있었던 한반도 논의를 요약하여 세계에 알리는 것을 고려하고 있다.1954년 6월 17일저우언라이\n",

      "Chairman [Mao Zedong], Comrade [Liu] Shaoqi, and the Central Committee: Comrade Molotov invited me to meet with Eden yesterday afternoon, and we discussed the following questions: (1) The Korean issue. There is no meeting today on 1 May, and the conference will reopen on 3 May. Only the Turkish and Thai delegations made speeches yesterday morning. The meeting was adjourned in less than thirty minutes. Eden suggested holding a restricted session and said that “[the members should be] the five of us plus North and South Korea.” Eden said that he had already talked to [US Secretary of State John Foster] Dulles about this, and he assumed that [French Foreign Minister Georges] Bidault would not oppose it either. Molotov and I both agreed to hold the restricted session. We also asked what subjects would be specifically discussed in the restricted session. However, Eden did not answer this question. It is the British and Americans who are taking the initiative and sounding us out, and we should not react too positively except to agree to hold the meeting. Based on the general situation, I assume that Eden's proposal for a restricted session is related to Dulles' return to the US next week. Until now, no North Atlantic [Treaty Organization] country except Turkey has spoken yet to support Dulles during the discussion of the Korean issue. Although the United States fired many blanks on the Indochina issue, they could not scare anyone but themselves. The United States is attempting to form an alliance of invaders of Southeast Asia. However, Britain is still hesitating. On the other hand, France's request for more air support is being refused by Britain and the United States. In sum, it is now impossible for the United States to stop negotiations on the Indochina issue. Eisenhower's recent words showed his retreat and embarrassed Dulles. Therefore Dulles decided to run away [from the conference] and leave the problems to the Under Secretary of State, [General Walter Bedell] Smith. Eden said that Dulles had already decided to return to the US next week. Molotov responded that “it will increase the responsibilities of the four of us.” The current situation shows that Eden will stay, and so will Bidault since [French Secretary of State for Relations with the Associated States Marc] Jacquet of the de Gaulle group and [French Foreign Ministry Political and Economic Affairs Assistant Director Roland Jacquin de] Margerie, who insists on the ending of the Indochina war, came to Geneva from France to pressure him. However, it is still not clear whether or not an agreement on the Korean issue can be reached.(2) The Indochina issue. Eden said that “I will not use this as a condition for the issue of membership [of countries which should be invited to join the discussion], nor do I require you to answer me. I just want to ask if the Soviet and Chinese sides can push for the withdrawal of the wounded from Dien Bien Phu.” Molotov said: “It can be solved if you discuss this with the Vietnamese delegation.” I said: “It is better to have the two belligerent parties discuss this directly. The two belligerent parties in the Korean War used to discuss directly the issue of exchanging wounded and sick POWs before the armistice in Korea.” Regarding the issue of membership, I said: “Five countries have already been invited to join the discussions on the Indochina issue. It is odd that the decision on the invitation of related countries on both sides has not yet been made. Obviously someone is preventing both sides from attending the negotiations.” Eden said: “I am not preventing it.” It seems that it will take another two days to solve the problem of membership.(3) The issue of Sino-British relations. When Molotov mentioned that China was complaining about unfairness in international affairs, Eden said: “Britain does recognize China. However, China does not recognize us.” I said: “It is not China which does not recognize Britain. It is Britain which does not recognize us in the United Nations.” Eden said: “Britain is also dissatisfied with China on some [other] things, but I do not want to mention these things when we are dining together today.” Talking about the improvement of Sino-British relations, Eden said: “I brought the British Chargé in the People's Republic of China, [Humphrey] Trevelyan here this time [to let him] meet with the Chinese delegation.” I said: “I also brought the Director of the Department of West European and African Affairs, Huan Xiang, here.” Eden said: “Well, we have some thoughts in common.” Trevelyan came to see us immediately after the meeting and had already arranged to invite Huan Xiang to dinner next week.(4) The issue of British-American relations. Molotov said: “The United States is intentionally creating tensions, and it makes the American people very jittery. This kind of situation does not exist in the Soviet Union. I assume that Britain does not like that either.” Eden said: “Although the United States [government] talks a lot, the American people are peace-loving.” Molotov then said: “Britain is an influential country in the West, and shares the same language with the United States. Britain should not underestimate its role in improving relations between East and West.” Eden said: “You are flattering me. Industrial development in the United States exceeded ours after World War II. It also replaced Britain as the world's leader. Although we are not jealous, the United States is too impatient.” Eden then cited a playwright [to the effect of]: “We have nothing in common with the United States except the same language.” I said: “Since the United States is not reconciled to the loss of China, it uses every means at its disposal to threaten and massacre people, especially the Chinese people. However, the Chinese people are not afraid of these threats. The American way of doing things only made its own people nervous.” Eden said: “The Americans have some reason to be dissatisfied. The Americans kindly helped China during its war against Japan. However, China repaid kindness with ingratitude.” I said: “The United States helped [Republic of China (ROC) President] Jiang Jieshi [Chiang Kai-shek] oppress and kill Chinese people. How could it not lead to the resistance of the Chinese people?” Eden said: “In fact, the British loss in China was greater than that of the Untied States.” I said: “If we do accounts in history, Britain did not lose anything.”(5) The issue of the Five Powers [i.e., the UK, the US, France, the PRC, and the Soviet Union. Eden said that he does not care if it is Four or Five Powers, the subcommittee should be composed of seven countries. Molotov said: “This is a good attitude. However, some people do not want to talk about the Five Powers.”Foreign journalists spread the rumor after the dinner that Eden had met with Dulles before his meeting with me. It was said that Dulles was very dissatisfied with Eden's action. Trevelyan invited [PRC Vice Trade Minister] Lei Renmin for dinner last night. The Deputy Under Secretary for Administration in the British Foreign Office, [Harold] Caccia, and the Assistant Under Secretary [for Foreign Affairs, William Dennis] Allen, were also present at the dinner. Trevelyan stated that three British trade organizations were willing to do business with China. Lei said that the representatives of the three organizations could first come to meet with [the Chinese delegation] at Geneva in order to find out detailed information. Trevelyan agreed with him. Trevelyan also invited Lei to come to Britain and visit the industrial exhibition. The Indian ambassador to Switzerland [Yezdi D. Gundevia] came to see me yesterday morning and asked for information about the Geneva Conference. Zhou Enlai 1 May [1954]\n",

      "Chairman Mao, Comrade [Liu] Shaoqi and the Central Committee: (I) The British and French delegations spoke for the first time yesterday at the tenth session regarding the Korean issue. Bidault and Eden not only reacted to our criticism, but also defended the United Nations and affirmed their positions to the United States. In addition, Bidault made detailed proposals. He emphasized two things: (1) The unified government must be proportionally elected based on the number of citizens in both North and South Korea; (2) The elections must be monitored and certified by observers from neutral nations who have supervisory authority. The selection of members for the international supervisory body should be based on the most balanced conditions in order to guarantee the objectivity of their opinions. Only United Nations organizations are eligible to choose such observers. Elections as well as the withdrawal or movement of [foreign] troops should also be placed under international supervision. In his speech, Bidault attacked the [North] Korean and Soviet delegations by name. However, he did not refer to China. Eden said that the POW issue had already been resolved (we plan to let our spokesman denounce this declaration in a written statement). Afterwards he referred to the British attitude toward the Asian issue. Eden disagreed with the argument concerning ?the tendency of Western countries to ignore or oppose Asian nationalist sentiment.? He boasted that India and Pakistan both decided to stay in the British Commonwealth of their own free will. Eden made five proposals on the Korean issue: 1. Elections must be held. It is necessary to establish an all-Korean government. 2. Elections should consider the population distribution in both North and South [Korea]. 3. Elections should be based on universal adult suffrage and confidential ballots. [Elections] should be held as soon as possible under conditions of true freedom. 4. The international supervision under the United Nations should be conducted by countries that are acceptable to this conference. 5. Conditions that will enable foreign troops to withdraw should be created. The United Nations forces will withdraw after they achieve the establishment of peace and security in Korea.The main issues of Eden's statement were international supervision, elections based on the distribution of population, and the subject of how to withdraw foreign troops. However, his speech was ambiguous. It is obvious that he is attempting to bargain with us. (II) After yesterday's meeting, Eden took the initiative in sounding us out through his secretary. He proposed coming to see me this morning at the villa. I agreed to see him. I have already consulted with the Soviet delegation about how to deal with him. I will report the result of the meeting later. Zhou Enlai 14 May 1954, 10:00 a.m.\n",

      "Chairman [Mao Zedong] and Liu [Shaoqi], Zhu [De], Nie [Rongzhen]:Zakharov just told [us] that Filippov [Stalin] sent a telegram, suggesting that, in order to enhance the Soviet Air Force’s [ability] to do battle with the American Air Force in our military’s rear areas, [they] plan to send 120 more M-15 jet planes and add, in two batches, to the organizations of the Belov Air Division, and also set up an Air Force organization to command them.  Zakharov’s opinion is that, besides using the airports in Andong, Anshan, Liaoyang and Shenyang, one more airport must be built rapidly near Andong [Dandong].  Yesterday [we] discussed this and decided on the location as Gushan, west of Dadonggou.  Filippov sent the telegram, and is waiting for the  Chairman’s answer.  Now a telegram draft has been drawn up, so please give permission to send it out.It is believed that the proposal of adding more planes was put forward by Zakharov because of the Soviet planes’ military exploits in the Northeast (shot down 23 American planes in 12 days).  Meanwhile, the Soviet planes’ strengthening of backup for the Chinese armies is a show of force to the Americans.  This is presumably the main reason why Filippov decided to strengthen the Soviet air force.Zhou EnlaiNight of November 15 [1950]\n",

      "To the Chairman [Mao Zedong] and the Central Committee:[1] Received your telegram of September 13 at 2200 hours.[2] We brought up the Mexican Three Point Proposal at yesterday evening’s meal. Comrade Stalin believes that the Americans are urgently looking for a way to solve the Korean armistice problem. Comrade Stalin himself brought up that he would write a letter to the Chairman about Asian and United Nations issues for me to carry back to the Chairman. He added that the United Nations has already lost the function that it should have had and that we should prepare conditions for a new alliance [of nations].Stalin said: “You need first of all to find a way to persuade Asian countries to form a regional alliance. If you succeed, the Soviet Union will join it.”Then I passed on to him the point that the Chairman often makes, saying that we have for some time no longer been interested in the United Nations. Now the Asia Pacific Regional Meeting of World Peace Council is now gathering mass support for an Asian alliance.[3] That may force some Asian countries to approve the alliance. Stalin said, “There is no hurry. The participants in the regional alliance will be governments.”Now that I have received the Chairman’s telegram, within a day or two I will see Comrade Stalin and ask him to provide clearer guidance on these two issues.Zhou EnlaiSeptember 14 [1] The footnotes in this document were produced by the editors of Jianguo yilai Zhou Enlai wengao (Zhou Enlai’s Manuscripts since the Founding of the PRC) and have been translated into English. – Charles Kraus.[2] Telegram of September 13 at 2200 hours refers to the telegram that Mao Zedong sent to Zhou Enlai on September 13 at 2200 hours. The telegram text includes:   “The soon to be convened meeting of the United Nations General Assembly will discuss the Korean issue and the three point suggestion to solve the prisoner issue that Mexico proposed. (The Three Mexican Proposals refers to the Mexican POW [Prisoner of War] Settlement Proposal that Mexico had prepared to offer to the General Assembly of the United Nations. The proposals have three main parts: 1. Prisoners of the two sides that have expressed themselves willing to return to their country should be returned; 2. The remaining prisoners should be given temporary refugee status by other member states of the United Nations. These prisoners should be returned according to a procedure that is to be determined later; and 3. After the Korean situation returns completely to normal, their homelands should provide to those prisoners all assurances and conveniences in order to facilitate their immediate return to their countries. If some of the prisoners want to return home before the Korean situation has returned completely to normal, the governments concerned should make arrangements as above and give them various conveniences to facilitate their return to their countries.) It seems that the discussion of the Korean issue at the United Nations was instigated by the United Kingdom. This proposal from Mexico may also be instigated by the United Kingdom. The United States has expressed its willingness to discuss the former and has not expressed its attitude towards the latter. What attitude should we take between the two, please contact the Soviet Union? Comrades agreed. ”[3] Refers to the Asia Pacific Regional Meeting of World Peace Council meeting that would soon be convened on October 2, 1952 in Beijing.\n",

According to our information, the Korean question will be discussed at the forthcoming session of the General Assembly of the UN. Regarding the question of prisoners of war Mexico has advanced a proposal consisting of 3 points, which are: first, both sides immediately conduct an exchange of prisoners who have expressed the wish to return to their homeland; second, the remaining POWs will be transferred to the temporary protection of UN member states and be subject to repatriation according to an agreement which will be concluded; third, after a normal situation is established in Korea, to guarantee that these POWs can return to their homeland and to provide them with the possibility for this. Until the restoration of a normal situation in Korea, if the POWs ask to return to their homeland, then the corresponding government also must take measures and present to them all possibilities for repatriation.Apparently, the proposal to discuss the Korean question in the General Assembly of the UN was advanced at the initiative of England. The proposal of Mexico arose at the initiative of the USA. The latter have already expressed the wish to discuss this question in the UN General Assembly.We intend to express opposition to such a variant.I ask you to consult with comrade FILIPPOV about what our position should be on this question.2. India and Burma have made indications that they would like to sign a non-aggression pact with us, and also hope that you will visit these countries. The essence is that [Indian leader Jawaharlal] Nehru would like to visit China, with a view, however, that you will go to India on a return visit. We received this information from our ambassador in Burma Yao Zhongming.I suggest that it is highly possible that India and Burma will advance these questions for an exchange of opinion. If India and Burma make these proposals officially, then it would be inconvenient for us to refuse.I ask also that you consult with Comrade FILIPPOV about whether it is advisable for China to conclude such pacts with India and Burma.Mao Zedong.15 September 1952\n",

      "Comrade Ni Zhiliang:This is to acknowledge receipt of the September 18 telegram.  Please tell Comrade Kim Il Sung: We think your idea of fighting a protracted war is correct.  The courage of the North Korean army and masses is admirable.  Enemy numbers will probably increase at Inchon, the purpose of which is to extend their lines to the east and cut North Korea’s north-south transportation lines and also press on towards the 38th Parallel.  The People’s Army must do all it can to hold the area north of the 38th Parallel; [only in this way] will it be possible to carry on a protracted war.  Therefore, please think about the question of how to preserve [your] main forces under the general policy of persisting in relying on one’s own efforts and fighting for a long period of time so that the enemy can be destroyed one by one.  At present, [your] main force directly faces the enemy’s positions and both sides hold their ground.  This means much consumption [of resources.]  And if the enemy seizes Seoul, there is the danger that the People’s Army’s route of retreat will be cut off.  Therefore, it seems appropriate that the main force of the People’s Army should concentrate [but maintain] mobility, seek the enemy’s weak points and destroy the enemy part by part.  In battles, [you should] concentrate military strength.  In every battle, pin down large numbers of the enemy in divided branches with less military strength or firepower while using more military strength [three to five times] and firepower [at least twice] with absolute superiority to surround and annihilate fewer enemies (e.g. one regiment) that have been divided by us.  In battles, division of one’s forces should be avoided; most of all to be avoided is putting the enemy to flight or blocking the enemy instead of destroying the enemy’s effective strength.  So long as you can wipe out the enemy’s effective strength, annihilating only one regiment or one battalion is still good.  A big victory results from the accumulation of small victories.  They will progressively weaken the enemy and are beneficial in protracted war. If the US army’s firepower and equipment is strong and it is temporarily difficult to charge in and break it up, it is suitable to consider targeting the Syngman Rhee puppet army [by] concentrating [your] main force and annihilating one or two regiments every time, [thereby] annihilating one or two divisions every few months.  In half a year, the puppet army can be destroyed completely.  These lackeys of American imperialism will be cut off, which will isolate the American imperialists and then [you can] annihilate them separately.  Under the principles of protracted war, [one] must fully take into account the difficult side.  Long term planning must be made in all aspects of mobilization and usage of manpower, material resources and financial resources and lower-level subordinates must be made to avoid the mentality of putting all one’s eggs in one basket.  The enemy seeks a quick decision [in the war] and is afraid of it becoming protracted, while our People’s Army should avoid quick decisions and can only gain victory in a protracted war.  As friends and comrades, we provide the above for your reference.  Correct or not, [I] request [your] further consideration and reply.Zhou EnlaiSeptember 20\n",

      "Memorandum of Conversation: Premier Zhou Receives Indian Ambassador to China ParthasarathyTime: 30 September 1958, 10:30 p.m.Location: Beijing Hotel reception roomAccompanying Attendees: Vice Premier Chen Yi, Director Zhang WenjiTranslator: Pu ShouchangRecorder: Zhao [illegible]zhongAmbassador:    I received a letter from Mr. Menon; he had received the letter I sent him, and wanted me to thank you.Premier: Has Premier Nehru already returned to New Delhi?Ambassador:   Our premier will return to Delhi on 2 October; he just arrived in Yadong today.  Has the Premier seen Mr. Menon’s second speech?  This was a very important speech, [and] many of its key points are ones that the Premier and I have discussed; I sent it to him by telegram.Premier: [We] thank Mr. Menon very much; he has made great efforts at the United Nations. Ambassador:   Right now some things are happening behind the scenes, but it is still difficult to say that it has reached a specific stage.  Mr. Menon and [British Foreign Secretary Selwyn] Lloyd have spoken many times; it seems that the British also want to help a bit, but as I see it their attitude is still very vague, and not satisfactory.  Mr. Menon will continue to fight at the United Nations.  Mr. Menon said in his report to me that the atmosphere in the U.N. General Assembly is changing; only four countries voiced opposition during the discussion of India’s motion concerning China’s right of representation at the United Nations, and many representatives of the countries that voted no later stated to Mr. Menon that they hoped the issue of China’s seat at the United Nations could be resolved.Premier: Yes, this shows that many people still cannot do publically as they wish.Ambassador:   Even Latin American countries have taken this stance in private.  Besides this, there is another thing worth noting; in the past, American newspapers attacked ferociously when India raised the issue of China’s representation, but this time they were relatively restrained.  But currently finding a way forward is still a problem.Premier: Most people want peace, and demand rational resolution of issues; most people oppose activities that will spark war.Ambassador:   Mr. Menon had one or two questions he wanted me to ask the Premier to help clarify the Chinese government’s position, so that Mr. Menon can better do [his] work.  Mr. Menon wanted to know about the Warsaw talks; can the Premier tell me if anything new is happening in the Warsaw talks?Premier: There are no new changes in the Warsaw talks.  The America[ns] have not changed their position at all; America is under the delusion that it can fool world opinion with the so-called “ceasefire” issue, when in fact they can only cause some people to have a hazy understanding for a time, but these people will understand the truth of the matter sooner or later.  If America wants to do a “ceasefire” plot, let them, we are bound to make things clear.  The issue could not be more clear; for us to liberate Taiwan, the Penghu and [other] coastal islands, and punish Jiang Jieshi’s army, is a matter of China’s internal affairs.  These kinds of things have also happened a lot in other countries, and no one believed they would endanger peace and security.  The Indonesian government took military action against a rebel army; the rebel army in Indonesia had a so-called “government,” but no one said Indonesia had endangered peace and security.  The revolution in Iraq overthrew the imperial government and established a republic, but didn’t America later recognize it?  Why do they want to come and interfere when China punishes Jiang Jieshi’s army?  On the matter of coastal islands, we absolutely cannot accept this kind of unreasonable so-called “ceasefire.”  Similar things have happened so many times in other countries, why do [they] want to bully China?  There is no war between China and America; we have stated over and over that we are willing to peacefully confer with America about the two countries’ dispute in the Taiwan region and not resort to armed force, and [we] continue to have talks in Warsaw.  Many people in the world hope there will be no war between China and America; [they] should raise this [point] with America, because it is America who wants to use military force to interfere in our liberation of coastal islands, to expand its invasion and hinder our liberation of Jinmen [Quemoy] and Mazu [Matsu].  [If people want to] demand that armed force be abandoned, [they] should also demand that America abandoned armed force.  The basic problem is having America blaze the trail.  If America persists in its “ceasefire” plot, there is no option but continued disagreement; if America takes further military action, then America must take responsibility for the war it began.  Of course, up to this point America has only invaded China’s territorial waters and airspace, but this is very dangerous; they have already trespassed within 12 nautical miles of China, sometimes even within three nautical miles, and moreover have done so together with Jiang Jieshi’s warships; the American air force provides an escort for Jiang Jieshi’s warships, and has also trespassed into our airspace many times.  America has assembled forces not only from Japan but from other military bases, not only strengthening its navy in the Taiwan Strait, but also actively equipping Jiang Jieshi’s troops with new weapons.  Jiang Jieshi’s launch of Sidewinder missiles with F86 fighter jets, which we announced yesterday, is proof [of that].  This shows that America intends to play with fire at the brink of war [trans. note—that is, do dangerous things that will lead to an excuse for war].  The matter is very clear; if [people] want to ask that force be abandoned, they must ask America.  The way to clear out the source of the problem is for America to withdraw its troops.  We are prepared on two fronts; the first is continuation of negotiations, and the second is dealing with American provocations to war.  America understands that whatever they come at us with, we will come back [at them] the same way; the danger does indeed exist.  America wants to create a serious situation, then use that situation to fool world opinion into demanding a “ceasefire,” but the Chinese people will not be fooled, nor will they be frightened; on the contrary, the Chinese people will fight even more determinedly, mobilize even better, and people across the nation will be even more spirited in their determination.  That is the reason we celebrated National Day on a larger scale this year.Ambassador:   Has China made any formal suggestions in the Warsaw talks?Premier: Our suggestions are the same as those we discussed with the Ambassador last time.  They propose a “ceasefire,” we propose withdrawal of troops.  The first point in our suggestions was that China and America announce they will not resort to war and threats of armed force against each other, but peacefully negotiate — this is a basic principle; second, America withdraws its troops from the Taiwan region; third, the two sides continue to talk about issues related to the two aforementioned points. We explained very clearly as soon as the Sino-American talks began, that Taiwan, Penghu and other coastal islands are Chinese territory, and China has a right to liberate its own territory and require that American troops withdraw from Chinese territory.  We have also stated — as we discussed with the Ambassador last time — that if, when we recover Jinmen and Mazu, Jiang Jieshi is willing to withdraw of his own accord, we can [agree to] not pursue and attack.  Liberation of Taiwan could be a second step.  We also brought this up in talks.Ambassador:    I don’t want to go back over matters that have already been discussed; I learned about the two separate steps in earlier talks, and moreover it is not like there is no connection between these two steps.Premier:  But America hasn’t realized this at all; on the contrary, it proposes a “ceasefire.”Ambassador:    There is now an idea, which is to first have a “ceasefire,” or rather cease hostile actions, because it will take time to resolve the issues; first have Jiang Jieshi’s troops withdraw from Jinmen and Mazu, [leave] the status of these islands temporarily undetermined, and resolve it in later negotiations.Premier: This is a British idea, and completely impossible to accept.  As [we] said last time, the premise must be that first, Taiwan, Penghu, and other coastal islands are China’s territory.  Second is that the American army must withdraw, just as the American army should first withdraw from Lebanon; then specific issues can be specifically resolved.  Now America demands that we “cease fire” on the coastal islands issue; that is absurd, this kind of idea is the “two Chinas” idea.  Ambassador Nehru and I have spoken a lot about this idea of America’s in the past.  During the Eden administration, Britain recognized that the coastal islands were Chinese and should be returned to China, but [said] that the Taiwan issue should be resolved separately.  This already contains the idea of “two Chinas,” and we had stated already then that we absolutely could not accept it.  The Lloyd government has taken a step backward compared to the Eden government, because he has said publicly that in regard to the coastal islands, Jiang Jieshi’s army can be called upon to withdraw, but the status of the coastal islands is undetermined.  As for resolving Taiwan with separate approaches like “United Nations trusteeship” and “neutralization,” this is the “two Chinas” plot; Lloyd’s activities in New York were ill-intentioned.Ambassador:   I said last time, and would still like to emphasize now, that China must exercise sovereignty over the coastal islands.  Since there is this kind of idea now, I had to come and clarify again the position of the Chinese government.Premier: Britain’s idea absolutely cannot be considered; we also know that Lloyd is deliberately spreading this kind of atmosphere and is involved in these kinds of activities in the United Nations.Ambassador:   Right now this kind of idea is still in a very vague stage; it can’t be said to [be at the point of] any new motions being proposed.Premier: Lloyd knows China will not accept it; he’s peddling it to others, and doesn’t yet dare to bring it out in public.  The Macmillan government is a step backward compared to the Eden government, even if Eden’s ideas couldn’t be accepted either.  Actually, Eden was still a step away from the Labor Party, and we didn’t agree with the Labor Party’s ideas at all.  That is because they all scorn China’s sovereignty; they want America to use Jiang Jieshi to threaten [us], and become a perpetual bane to China.Ambassador:   Say that the first step was completed in accordance with China’s plan — that is, Jiang Jieshi’s army had withdrawn from the coastal islands, and China had sovereignty — how does the Chinese government envision later negotiations? Premier: [As] Mr. Menon has also said, if America recognizes that Taiwan, Penghu and the coastal islands belong to China, and recognizes China’s sovereignty over these islands, the issue is very easy to resolve; China and America could continue to negotiate the issue of how America would withdraw troops.  The issue of China and Taiwan is a domestic affairs issue; we can always find a way to resolve it.Ambassador:   Mr. Menon asks whether [you] can tell him about the progress of China’s negotiations with Jiang Jieshi; of course, this needs to be kept absolutely secret.Premier: The Chinese government and Jiang Jieshi are in indirect negotiations, but these are often sabotaged by America.  America is afraid that if we and Jiang Jieshi agree, they’ll be shown the door.  Of course Jiang Jieshi is also very crafty; what he wants is to drag America into the mud and [have it] fight in his place — Mr. Menon has also mentioned this in a speech.  And if America has other plans, he has other plans too. This is where the complexity of the problem lies.  One issue is that of an international dispute between China and America, one issue is a domestic affairs matter between the Chinese government and Jiang Jieshi.  America has grown dizzy in the middle, shuttling hither and thither, unable to find a way out.  As Chairman Mao says, America has stuck its head into the noose of the Taiwan Strait; should it stick its head further in, or withdraw from the noose? [Trans. note—“sticking its head further in” refers to the expansion of American protection from Taiwan (further away from the mainland) to offshore islands like Jinmen and Mazu.]  America is now going back and forth between the two [options]; it looks like America will not change at present, so let’s just let it keep going back and forth.  America has two aircraft carriers in the Taiwan Strait region called “Midway” and “Prowler;” fine, we will just let them “prowl” “midway.”  Please tell Mr. Menon that we are very grateful for his kindness, but there is no hurry.  We are Easterners, we all understand the personality of the Easterner, which is not one for [anxious] hurry.  Last time regarding the issue of American criminals, Hammarskjöld came to say that releasing the American pilots would improve Sino-American relations; at the time he also said repeatedly that he had absolutely nothing to do with the affair of the two spies Downey and Fecteau.  Later we did as Hammarskjöld said and released the American pilots; even the American newspapers admitted this.  We released both the American pilots before August 1955.  Now three years have gone by, and China and America have negotiated for two and a half years, but the result is there are no signs of the relationship taking a turn for the better; on the contrary, America has directed Jiang Jieshi to concentrate one-third of his army in Jinmen and Mazu.  When Mr. Menon came to China later, he also said that if some more American criminals were released, Sino-American relations could take a turn for the better; we accepted this suggestion, released even more criminals, and reached an agreement with America.  We now have only four criminals left, but what does America do?  It still detains many Chinese.  On my second trip to India, Nehru also said prior to his visit to America that [we should] release more American criminals; I told him there was no advantage to releasing more, and [we] could not release any more.  Actually, recently Dulles has not been using the issue of the criminals anymore, but rather some newly proposed things.  Eisenhower even says that withdrawing troops from Jinmen and Mazu would be another Munich; this is extremely absurd.  The Swedish foreign minister also expressed disagreement with this statement.  Dulles said that Jinmen and Mazu should be turned into West Berlin; [this] is even more obviously intending to create “two Chinas.”  Dulles also said that China cannot enter the United Nations because China has committed at least five major crimes.  [I] assume that the Chinese crimes he is referring to are, first, the Korean War, and second, Vietnam. On the issue of Vietnam, we did not enter the war, and he still charges us with it; in fact, in Geneva we even helped with negotiations to resolve the Vietnam issue, a point that Dulles acknowledges in the very same speech.  The third charge is that we liberated our own territory, Tibet; it is no wonder, then, that America opposed India liberating Kashmir.  The fourth was liberating the Yijiangshan [Ichiangshan] Islands, and the fifth is this time with Jinmen and Mazu.  In the future [when we] liberate Taiwan, that will be the sixth major crime.Vice Premier Chen: In America’s eyes, the biggest charge [against us] is our liberation of China.  In that case, Washington’s liberation of America was a crime, and Lincoln waging the Civil War, using armed force to resolve an internal conflict, was also a major crime.Premier: Regardless of whether America gives up its “ceasefire” plot, we will continue to fight, either with civilian or with military [organizations]; this is something they have forced on us.  So there is no need to hurry now.  They say “ceasefire” in order to fool the people of the world.  In fact, they are playing with fire, not wanting to “cease fire.”  They are now using things like “use of armed force” to fool people; we have already explained clearly to people that not using armed force refers to international disputes.  If America does not cancel the ceasefire proposal, we can only continue to fight; there is no room for compromise.Ambassador:   I want to make it clear to the Premier that India will not be involved in any compromise activities.  I brought up this kind of idea [people] have now in order to seek clarification of China’s position.Premier: It was just in order to help Mr. Menon clarify our position that I have put this issue somewhat more clearly.Ambassador:   There is another small question, which is that there was an argument in Western newspapers, prior to August 23rd, about which of the two sides took more military actions.  In this respect, the Premier once said that Jiang Jieshi’s troops were increased from 30,000 to 70,000, but could [you] bring up more facts, so that Mr. Menon can better raise this issue [?]Premier: This question must be answered in two parts.  First, Jiang Jieshi’s troops in Jinmen and Mazu frequently carry out destructive [activities] against us.  Of course, it wasn’t necessarily major sabotage every time; [it] was especially directed against the two nearby cities, Xiamen and Fuzhou.  In 1955 [they] bombed Fuzhou; [they] frequently dispatch spies, disrupt the passage of commercial ships, and do damage to our fishing vessels and fishermen.  We have noted down these debts.  We warn them, we will mete out punishment; as [I] said last time with the Ambassador, debts must always be paid.  [Even] Dulles admits that the problems have existed for nine years already; there are nine years’ worth of accounts to be tallied.  Secondly, they have been doing it for nine years; we have only been taking punitive action for 40 days.  Why in nine years has Western public opinion not come out and said anything of Jiang Jieshi’s actions, isn’t that due to American toleration of Jiang Jieshi?  Now we punish Jiang Jieshi’s army and Western newspapers raise a hue and cry, isn’t that because America is involved?  If it weren’t for American interference, we would have recovered these islands long ago.  Didn’t the Indonesian government take military action in Sumatra and Sulawesi?  Thus the key to the problem is still America.  I want to take this opportunity to ask the Ambassador to thank Menon; he worked very hard at the United Nations for the restoration of China’s legal seat, and supports our just struggle, but please tell Mr. Menon not to be anxious.  America is being truculent and unreasonable, and isolating itself; when America senses that it is isolated, they might change course.  By the way, [I] will tell the Ambassador a piece of news, and please also tell Mr. Menon: the Norwegian government has asked us whether we would agree for Hammarskjöld to come and mediate; we have already formally answered them that under the circumstances of our United Nations seat still being usurped and 600 million Chinese people not having their own representative, we do not wish to have any contact with the United Nations, so we do not think it appropriate for Mr. Hammarskjöld, as Secretary General of the United Nations, to come get involved in this matter.  This is not a problem with Hammarskjöld himself, even less a refusal to accept the Norwegian government’s concern; we are very grateful for Norway’s support of us in the United Nations.  Please convey that point to Mr. Menon as well.\n",

      "Report of the Romanian Dispensary No. 2 Hospital No. 39 in KoreaJanuary 5, 1952To the Central Committee of the Red CrossBucharestIn our first report we described [our] trip to Moscow and the time we had spent there. We took care of the morale of [our] team and, at the same time, we [illuminated] the reasons for which Comrade Buburuț had been sent home. […] The only shortcoming of our stay in Moscow was the fact that we did not have the opportunity to visit any medical institutions. Our embassy in Moscow showed us that such visits must be organized in advance by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs. We did not have the opportunity to buy any medical instruments. Right before our departure from Moscow, we met the Romanian scientific delegation, led by Comrade Minister Mârza, at the Metropol Hotel. Comrade Minister Mârza addressed a few words to us in the hotel lobby, wishing us good luck with our work. He underlined the importance of our mission and pointed our attention to the fact that every member of our team is in essence a little ambassador of our country and therefore our work and our behavior must [reflect this status].We left Moscow on December 9, 1951. We were seen off at the railway station by Comrade Ambassador Bughici, Comrade Frunză and by other comrades from the Embassy. Three members of the Korean Embassy also came to the railway station. Before departing, we checked to see if our crates were loaded on board. On December 16, 1951 we reached Otport at the Sino-Soviet border. After going through the customs formalities, that same evening we reached the town of Mandjuria [Manzhouli] in China. A member of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs was waiting for us there.  We were taken to the hotel on a bus. At the hotel in Mandjuria, they organized a dinner party for us. We were greeted by the representatives of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and by local authorities. Short speeches were given. A Chinese meal was served, which stirred everybody’s curiosity. We left Mandjuria on December 17, 1951. We traveled in sleeping carriages. We ate in the restaurant carriage. On December 19, 1951, at 1:45, we arrived in Mukden [Shenyang] after an incident-free journey. Comrade Kaliniuk, from our Embassy in Pyeongyang [Pyongyang], waited for us at the railway station. We were taken to the hotel of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. We met with comrade Ambassador Babuci, who provided us with priceless advice on [how] to set up our equipment and who has been constantly taking care of us ever since. […] On December 20, 1951, in the evening, we left Mukden, heading for Andong [Dandong], where we arrived on the morning of December 21. In Andong a Korean officer and a Korean translator who speaks German [picked us up] in their trucks to take us to our destination. We left Andong on December 23, 1951, in the morning, divided among the three trucks and a jeep […] On December 24, 1951, in the morning, we continued our journey. At about 100km away from our destination, close to a railway, the engine of the car broke down. There was an air battle above us. The situation [was] very critical, there were not many places where we could hide. Over 30 planes fought fiercely for over 45 minutes. […]We live in 7 houses which are to a great extent [built] underground. We are protected from machine-gun attacks in these houses, but not from bombings. Most houses are cramped and poorly heated. We suffer from the cold, smoke, and in some of the houses there are lots of rats (they eat the pillows from under our heads, as these pillows are stuffed with rice straws; they eat the leather bands of our backpacks). Lighting is intermittent, but most of the time, we have no light…We found the kitchen in a poor state of orderliness and in very bad hygiene. Our food was prepared according to Korean customs, and we left the table hungry, although the food ration we are officially allotted is the following (per person and per day): 40 grams of macaroni, 200 grams of flour, 50 grams of canned meat, 20 grams of sugar, 50 grams of salami, 500 grams of bread, 40 grams of butter, 200 grams of fresh meat, 300 grams of apples, 100 grams of rice, 30 grams of fat. We also asked for potatoes, onions, carrots and parsley […].On December 28th, 1951, we took over the kitchen. We pick up the allotted rations twice a month and we cook whatever we want. We have three Korean kitchen aides. On December 31, 1951, the Region’s Party Organization brought us cigarettes, a sort of moonshine, Korean wine, apples, eggs and some towels. The Embassy gave us some cognac as a gift, which we sometimes use when it is too cold or when the Korean [comrades] visit us. On December 21, we drank a glass for the health of the dear leader of the peoples in the entire world, comrade Stalin […].On January 3, 1952, our group met in a plenary session to analyze our work. Please find attached the entire report presented by Comrade Csizer and provided for the general discussion: […]Organizational Principles:a) We are a group of doctors and nurses, which came to help the Korean people. We are not an independent hospital.b) We are under Korean military command and under the control of our embassy.c) We must attain perfect collaboration with medical personnel of the Korean military.The Current Profile of Hospital No. 39The hospital has a commander, a political deputy, and an administrative officer. We have a translator who can speak English and a translator who speaks German. The hospital has seven sections, amounting to 1,500 beds. We are only in charge of Section No. 1 (serious injuries of the thorax, abdomen, upper limbs), no.2 (internal diseases, surgery) and No. 4 (ENT—ear, nose, and throat). ResolutionsNo important decision, be it of administrative nature, be it political, can be taken by someone else but the head of the team.The head of the team will consult with certain members of the team, on important issues, as he sees fit.Orders are executed accordingly.On work-related issues, the organizational hierarchy will be strictly respected.Criticism is permitted, but it is to be made during meetings among Party members or during work-analysis meetings. Destructive criticism, gossiping, and small-group critical chit-chats will be resolutely fought against.  The local conditions require a lot of tact, understanding, good-will, as well as patience, on our behalf, towards the locals [...].ExplanationsWe will intervene in the private life [of our team’s members] every time we notice a kind of behavior or a deed which damages the reputation [of the country] or just of the team. Observations of this nature can be made only to the team leader and not in public [...].Any suspicion of a [potential] manifestation of informality or provincialism will be raised with the team leader.The Situation of the PatientsMost of the patients are treated in very harsh conditions. They are undernourished. They only eat rice broth and a handful of rice. The ration that we are given is the ration of a Korean soldier. However, the injured do not get this ration. For the time being, we do not know the reasons for this situation. The majority of the rooms in which the patients are treated are very poorly heated. They suffer from the cold.  We come across patients, whose wounds had not been bound up for 5, 6, 7 days, they lie around in dirty clothes, on mattresses soaked in puss and with only one cover. It is awfully dirty. There are only four or five types of drugs. The bandage room is utterly poorly heated and camouflaged.  Despite our persistence, we managed to ameliorate the situation only to a small extent. The operating room is partially [built] underground, just like our living quarters. It is crammed and poorly heated as well. The [surgery] instruments are few and the materials are scarce. As we already mentioned, there is no electricity most of the time. The voltage is 100 V. This is not a spelling mistake. It is 100 V and not 110 V. There are permanent fluctuations, so in reality it is far below 100 V. The equipment using electricity is not yet working. Surgeries are carried out at candle light or our flash lights. Today we installed a Petromax lantern in the operating room, which we bought in Andong. There are neither rubber gloves, nor [surgical] thread. They operate with their bare hands on both septic and aseptic [patients].The Security of the TeamVaccines must be given in Bucharest. We kept postponing these vaccines (like in the case of the smallpox vaccine, which was administered only yesterday). We will also got the exanthematic vaccine, the TAB [typhoid-paratyphoid A and B vaccine], the anti-cholera vaccine, and the anti-dysentery vaccine. We will also get the tetanus toxoid vaccine. We were told about the existence of amoebic dysentery. Today, they discovered 12 cases of pulmonary distoma […].The roads are very dangerous. [It is] not only [dangerous] on the road, but also between sections (each section is located in a different village], or even between houses. Planes harass us at least three times a day and attack us with their machine guns. Groups of five to six planes (they are called ‘crosses’, because of the shape of their formation) fly over before meals. They descend to lower altitudes and machine-gun as soon as the notice some sort of movement. Any such ‘visit’ lasts between 10 and 45 minutes. After the meal, they repeat [the attack] in the same manner. From dusk to late at night planes are circulating. They machine-gun or bomb wherever they notice light. Until now, our village was not intensely bombarded. Only two hand-made bombs were launched [on us]. These planes frequently come without us hearing them, and we suddenly hear the machine-gun salvos. It is very hard to be vigilant in these conditions […].We are rather impressed with the wretched terrorist acts of the Americans. Every day, we have palpitations for our lives and health and for that of our comrades. Our toilets are [poorly built] and unhygienic (we discovered a toilet right on top of the main water-well). Everything is very dirty. We find clothes soaked in blood and puss around the operating room. Used cotton [and] bandages are discarded everywhere. [There are so many] outbreaks of infections, the fight against which we could not even start yet. For the time being, because of winter, we did not come across any infectious diseases, except for distoma, but later on, there will be a serious danger. We have not come across yet of any case of exanthematic typhoid fever.The Telegram of Comrade Kim Il SungOn January 1, 1952, we received the following telegram:Dear Comrades,On behalf of our Korean people, our Government and myself, I would like to send a warm greeting on the occasion of the [new] year, 1952, to all your comrades. You came from far away, from your motherland, to [join] our war for the liberation of the Fatherland from the American imperialist invaders, and you treated many of our wounded soldiers and officers, showing devotion and the spirit of the true internationalist friendship.We, the Korean people, will never forget your glorious deeds and in the future the friendship between our two people will increasingly strengthen.I wish you [with all my heart] that you always be healthy in this coming year, 1952, and that you achieve as many accomplishments as possible in your sacred mission to help the people of the fighting Korea.Kim Il Sung,The Prime Minister of the People’s Republic of Korea CabinetThe telegram was read in our work-analysis meeting and received with enthusiasm by all the members of our team. We formulated an answer which we passed to our Embassy to send [to the Korean authorities].Additions made after the formulation and reading of the report at the meeting Since getting here, on Korean territory, our team experienced six deaths and fourteen injuries. The morale of the team is not shaken, but none of us expected such an intense air activity which puts our life in danger and prevents us from carrying out the intense activity we hoped for. Relatively quiet moments are rare and not really at suitable times of the day […].Dr. Csizer ZoltanTeam LeaderSignatures of the twenty two members of the Romanian Medical Mission to KoreaFebruary 12, 1952 \n"
