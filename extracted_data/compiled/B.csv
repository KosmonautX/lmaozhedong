Bulganin and AntonovThe forces of the Far Eastern Front in the course of August 17 continued to implement the task put before them under sharply diminished resistance of the adversary. Along some directions during the day there were instances of capitulation of separate contingents and detachments of the adversary, and also the dispatch of parliamentarians to us. Both the statement of the Kwantung Army to the Soviet Army in the Far East, and the reports of the parliamentarians, speak about the order given to the forces of the Kwantung Army about stopping military actions of the Japanese army and capitulation. During the day up to 25000 Japanese-Manchurian soldiers and officers were disarmed. Capitulation continues, even though skirmishes occur along parts of the front. On the basis of the tasks put before the forces of the Far East and the Pacific Ocean Fleet, that is: occupation of the territory of all of Manchuria, Inner Mongolia, Liaodong Peninsula with the ports of Dairen [Dalian] [and] Port Arthur, Korea up to the 38th  parallel, southern half of the island of Sakhalin, half of the island of Hokkaido to the north of the line going from the town of Kushiro to the town of Rumoe [sic], including both of the said towns in the Soviet area, and fully all of the Kurile islands, the forces of the front, for the coming period, have been given the following tasks:The Transbaikal Front together with the forces of the MPR [Mongolian People’s Republic] are to occupy territories of Manchuria and Inner Mongolia within the line [running] from Tsitsihar until Changchun, Tonghua and further along the Zhujian [sic] (Yalu) River until the Korean bay, fully the Liaodong and the Kwantung peninsulas and further until the southern borders of former Manchuria and Inner Mongolia.

1,Cable from Aleksandr Vasilevsky to Stalin,19450820,"Moscow. Cde. StalinCopy: General Staff Cde. AntonovReporting on the situation on the Far Eastern front at the end of 19.8.45.1. On 19.8.45 on all fronts in Manchuria the resistance of the Japanese forces ceased and our forces began planned disarmament of the forces of the enemy. During the day of 19.8.45 about 65 thousand Japanese-Manchurian forces were disarmed. 2. During the day the forces of the Transbaikal Front deployed air troops with responsible representatives of the command of the Front to Changchun and Mukden [Shenyang], 250-300 people in each city. Our forces in the aforesaid cities were met with warm welcome on the part of the Japanese command and representatives of the Japanese authorities. All demands of our representatives are being fully implemented. During the night of 20.8.45 these cities are being approached by our forward mobile detachments. On 20.8.45 the cities of Changchun and Mukden will be fully secured by us. 3. Forces of the 1st Far Eastern Front during the day continued to disarm detachments of the 3rd and the 5th armies of the Japanese forces. During the day the front’s forces deployed air troops, with whose assistance the city of Kirin was captured. Mobile land forces will enter the city no later than 20.8.45.4. Forces of the 2nd Far Eastern Front continued, after capturing Shanxing [sic], without meeting enemy resistance, to move along both banks of Sungari [Songhua] River. The city of Harbin is still firmly occupied by our forces, landed on 18.8.45 by the first Far Eastern Front. On the island of Sakhalin from the morning of 19.8.45 the Japanese initiated the capitulation of their forces, which are located immediately in front of our Front. During the day of 19.8.45 more than three thousand Japanese soldiers and officers of the 88th infantry division capitulated here, and our forces moved 25 km to the south by the end of the day. From the evening of 19.08.45 from Sovgavan’ we transferred troops numbering 4220 people with artillery and transport with the aim of landing in the vicinity of the port of Maoka (southern part of Sakhalin) so as to speed up full occupation of the island. In our estimates, the island of Sakhalin should be fully occupied no later than the evening of 21.8.45. On the Kurile Islands dogged fighting continued and counter-attacks by the enemy on the island of Simusyu [Shumshu] were being beaten back until 19.8.45. From 19.00 on 19.8.45 fighting on this island ceased and the enemy, with the assistance of their parlamentarians, began general capitulation. From the morning of 20.8.45 we begin to land troops on the island of Paramushiru-to [Paramushir]. 5. On 19.8.45 I had a meeting with the head of the headquarters of the Kwantung Army Lieutenant General Hata. In accordance with your instructions [we] created the most favorable conditions for his reception in all respects. General Hata asked to hurry up with the questions of the occupation of the entire territory of Manchuria so that the Soviet forces could as quickly as possible take the Japanese army, and the Japanese population in Manchuria, under their protection. At the same time General Hata asked to postpone disarming of Japanese forces in remote regions of Manchuria and Korea until the arrival of our forces, in order to provide for necessary order and guarantee the safety of factories and possessions. As General Hata stated, the deterioration of relations between the Japanese and the Manchus, and also the Koreans in recent days has reached the limit. General Hata, requesting the quickest entry of our forces into Manchuria and, as a consequence, the capitulation of his army, at the same time requested appropriate attitude both to generals and officers, and the soldiers of the Japanese army on our part, and also appropriate sustenance and medical service for them. I gave our forces necessary instructions in this respect.6. General Hata finished his conversation with me with assurances that all my demands about the order of the implementation of capitulation will be immediately and precisely executed, and also expressed his hopes that this meeting will be guarantee future strong friendship between Japan and the USSR. To my request to inform the command of the Japanese forces defending the Kurile Islands about the pointlessness of their fight against the Soviet forces, which are striving to occupy these islands, general Hata promised to immediately turn to the Japanese headquarters with this question. At 17.00 on 19.9.45 general Hata flew to Changchun with my instructions where he landed at 21.00 under difficult weather conditions. 7. At the present time I and the command of the first Far Eastern front are seriously preoccupied with the preparation of the operation to land on the island of Hokkaido. Currently we are gathering maritime intelligence, preparing the air force, the artillery, infantry and means of transport. With your permission we will begin the maritime operation immediately after occupying the southern part of Sakhalin, approximately on 22.8.45. 8. On 19.8.45 the Emperor of Manchukuo “Pu Yi” and his retinue were delivered to the headquarters of Kravchenko’s army. In accordance with your instructions, I am interning him and I am thinking of placing him in the region of Chita. 9. In accordance with your instructions I gave directions to the Transbaikal Front command to prepare landing troops with the aim of sudden capture of the ports of Dairen [Dalian] and Port Arthur [Lüshun]. 20.8.45 3.00Vasilevsky","['Vasilevsky, Aleksandr Mikhaylovich']","['Kuril Islands', 'World War, 1939-1945--Campaigns--Japan--Hokkaido', 'World War, 1939-1945--Campaigns--China--Manchuria']"

We have repeatedly turned to the Ministry of Foreign Trade, but they tell us that the question of sending Soviet specialists should be decided by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.In the Ministry of Foreign Affairs they say that this is a matter of the Ministry of the Armed Forces, and the latter said that it does not have specialists at its disposition and is not competent to decide this question.Thus up to now the question of selecting and sending Soviet specialists for work in North Korea has practically not been solved.The situation which has developed in North Korea requires the immediate dispatch of Soviet specialists there.All the Japanese specialists who continued to work in North Korea for some time after the Japanese surrender have been repatriated to Japan.[Translator’s note: the following paragraph was highlighted in the left Because of the shortage of engineering and technical personnel the industry and rail transport of North Korea did not fulfill the 1947 first quarter plan.The People’s Committee of North Korea has repeatedly turned to us for aid with engineering and technical personnel. However, we have not yet been given it this aid.All this creates among the People’s Committee a feeling of uncertainty that they will be able to cope with the management of nationalized industry and transport.The industry and transportation of North Korea cannot operate without the aid of Soviet or other foreign specialists. We need to send Soviet engineering and technical personnel to North Korea without delay not only to help the People’s Committee put industry and transport in order, but also to strengthen the position and influence of our country in Korea for the future.[Translator’s note: the following paragraph was highlighted in the left MERETSKOV, SHTYKOVNº 6478/sh12 May 1947Sent by Rodina at 2145 12 May 1947[At the bottom of the first page: deciphered at 1950 12 May 1947 Martynov13 copies printedCopy Nº 1 to Cde.

STALINWe report information about the situation in Korea at the 38th parallel.After the withdrawal of our troops from North Korea violations of the regime at the 38th parallel by the “Southerners” have taken on a provocative and systematic nature. In the past month these violations have become more frequent. During the entire period from 1 January through 15 April of this year 37 violations were made along the entire 38th parallel, of which 24 were in the period from 15 March through 15 April.In their nature the violations are clashes [between] police security units, from regiment to battalion in strength, accompanied by small arms and mortar fire and a crossing of the 38th parallel by the “Southerners”. In all cases of violations the initiative of opening fire came from the “Southerners”.At the same time as the aggravation of the situation at the 38th parallel during March and April the “Southerners” brought up combat forces to the 38th parallel.For example, the 1st Infantry Brigade was moved from Seoul to the region of [KAYDZIO [(KAESONG)].According to information which needs to be verified the concentration of the troops of the “Southerners” at the 38th parallel continues.It is not excluded that new provocations against troops of the North Korean Government from the “Southerners” might take place, bringing larger forces into action than has occurred up to now. [Translator’s note: the following paragraph was highlighted in the left margin]. Considering this, we consider it advisable to recommend the Command of the Forces of the North Korean Government take proper steps to be ready to respond to possibly larger provocative action by the “Southerners”[signature] VASILEVSKY[signature] SHTEMENKO20 April 1949Nº 41064","['Vasilevsky, Aleksandr Mikhaylovich', 'Shtemenko, S.

5,Ciphered Telegram from Shtykov,19490502,"Ciphered TelegramStrictly SecretFrom PyongyangI report the results of the investigation I have organized of the information about the preparation for the withdrawal of American troops and the preparations of the South Korean army for an attack on North Korea, which were pointed out in your telegram. This information was received by the department of political security of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, which is occupied with intelligence gathering in the South.  However, this information, which was received by Korean intelligence at the beginning of April was not reported either to the chief of counterintelligence, who is the deputy minister, or to the minister of internal affairs, and consequently was not sent to the Korean government.The materials received were transferred by the chief of the department of political security to our military intelligence, through which, apparently, they were also received by you.Since this information was not reported either to the minister of internal affairs or to Prime Minister Kim Il Sung, or to our adviser at the ministry of internal affairs, I was also not informed of it.I consider such facts intolerable, I am taking measures toward their elimination and toward putting things in the necessary order.According to the information of our agents and the broadcasts of Seoul Radio, at the present time American and South Korean authorities are conducting negotiations about the withdrawal of American troops from South Korea.  The UN Commission is also participating in these talks, which is obvious from Rhee Syngman’s statement of 16 April, which stated: “…Representatives of the government of the Korean Republic and the government of the USA are presently conducting negotiations about the withdrawal of American troops from Korea.  The UN Commission on Korea has been informed of this.  Consultation with it will be a big help in these negotiations.”According to the statement of American ambassador Muccio on 19 April, the negotiations “will be concluded in the course of several months.”  The establishment of a precise time period for the withdrawal of American troops, according to Rhee Syngman’s statement of 19 April, “will depend on how much time is needed to prepare the army of the Korean Republic.”The minister of national defense of the South Korean government stated to correspondents that the South “has a sufficient number of troops to maintain order in the country after the withdrawal of American troops and, moreover, if North Korea attacks the South, the Army of National Defense not only can withstand it, but can also inflict a perceptible blow.”In connection with plans for a military intrusion into the North, South Korean authorities are increasing the size of the “Army of National Defense.”  According to the reports of our agents, the South Korean Army has increased from 53,600 soldiers as of 1 January 1949, to 70,000 as of the end of the first quarter [of the year].Special attention is paid to the technical, mechanical and special troops, which have grown by 2-4 times.  Measures have been taken to purge the army of ‘unreliable’ soldiers and officers.  Military units are being reinforced by reactionary-minded youths.  Americans are transferring to the South Koreans a significant quantity of various types of weapons and ammunition.  South Korean authorities are taking measures to receive weapons on a much larger scale.  This is the main purpose of Cho Byung-ok’s mission in Washington.South Korean authorities have concentrated a large number of troops in areas adjoining the 38th parallel.According to the information received, the total number of troops in this area has reached 41,000 persons.  The South Korean authorities are paying special attention to the Pyongyang direction.According to the report of the commander of a South Korean battalion, who is connected to the North’s intelligence service, the number of troops in the Pyongyang direction will be increased to 30,000.  The plans for the operation against the North have been worked out and in the first brigade they have already been passed to the battalion commanders.  The actions are supposedly planned for the month of June.  In connection with these plans the South Korean authorities are taking decisive measures to suppress uprisings in the South and to defeat completely the democratic movement.Agents of the South have set up terrorist and subversive groups in every province in the North, which are ordered to recruit new members, conduct espionage, and draft plans for uprisings.  In case military operations begin, they must carry out diversion, terror and organize an uprising.  These groups receive grenades and guns from the South, and, as arrested persons confess, in May they will receive additional weapons.  Such groups have been uncovered in Pyongyang (2), Haeju (1), and Sinuiju (1).I had meetings with Kim Il Sung and Pak Hon Yong regarding all these questions and agreed on carrying out the necessary preliminary measures. Measures have been taken to raise vigilance and strengthen the army and police of North Korea.2/V-49  SHTYKOV","['Shtykov, Terentiĭ Fomich, 1907-1964']","['Korean War, 1950-1953', 'Korea (South)--Military relations--United States', 'Korea (South)--Armed Forces']"

FILIPPOV.I am sending you information received by our information organization in TIANJIN:1. On 25 June the Fatherland Front of KOREA made a decision about holding general elections in the country on 20 October.This decision was made at a moment when peace talks between the CPC and the Kuomintang were broken off, but units of the PLA had forced the Yangtze River and occupied the cities of SHANGHAI, NANKING, etc. These events raised the mood and morale of the population of South KOREA.At the same time the democratic leaders of North and South KOREA thought that this political offensive is a precondition of a military offensive which should be conducted in October. Their leadership also thought this was its strategic goal and therefore planned their work in this direction and sent large groups of cadre to South KOREA to perform underground work in order to prepare an action [vystuplenie] in October.The Worker’s Party of KOREA has actively mobilized the popular masses to support this struggle. The population of South KOREA also thought that the time was already ripe to display its loyal attitude. Thus both the progressive and also sympathetic elements were inspired to take part in the struggle. They either sheltered and protected revolutionary leaders or gave active support – they prepared for the action on time. At that time this fact forced SYNGMAN RHEE to abandon the forcible implementation of the military service law. 2. However, only minor clashes occurred during July at the 38th parallel, and by October complete calm was observed.A fourth session of the supreme council of the popular assembly was convened in North KOREA in October at which a fundamental amendment to the previously planned line was introduced.Explanations were made about this among senior officials that the goal of the political offensive had already been achieved, and inasmuch as South KOREA is not acting, therefore it is also not right for North KOREA to make the first shot. But this explanation was not made among low-level officials.3. The population of South KOREA was extremely disappointed as a result of all of this. Many think that the Worker’s Party had deceived them.The majority of officials sent to South KOREA from North KOREA were unmasked [or] compromised. The unworthy of them went over to the side of the enemy, but the sympathizers drew back.The reactionaries began reprisals in South KOREA beginning with the second half of October: almost all the members of the city committee of the Worker’s Party in SEOUL were arrested, thus its main position in South KOREA collapsed.The majority of the remaining senior officials from the CC of the Worker’s Party were also arrested except PAK [HYUNG-SIK] and some other people who sold out to the enemy.4. At the present time discussions about the political line have begun inside the Worker’s Party and the Fatherland Front.Both the revolutionary officials as well as sympathizers in South KOREA as well as sympathizers and people who took part in this struggle complain that the political slogans are not being implemented in practice. Now a loss has been inflicted by the enemy which has increased the difficulty in the matter of the unification and incorporation of South KOREA. It is especially sad that almost everything that the officials sent to South KOREA have been lost right now.I don’t know whether the above information corresponds to reality. But if it does then we ought to pay serious attention to this.[Translator’s note: the following paragraph was highlighted in the left MAO ZEDONG 21 October 1949”Nº 234 KOVALEV 23 OctoberDeciphered by Finenko at 0840 24 OctoberPrinted by Doronchenkova at 0920 24 OctoberFive copies printed, copy Nº 5 to fileNº 6998Verified by the shift chief – [illegible signature] 1100","['Mao, Zedong, 1893-1976', 'Kovalev, Ivan']","['Korean Worker’s Party', 'China--Foreign relations--Korea (North)', 'China--Foreign relations--Soviet Union', 'Korea (North)--Foreign relations--Korea (South)', 'Communist leadership--Korea (South)', 'Political parties--Korea (South)']"

Aside from ethnic Koreans dispersed throughout PLA divisions, there are also four battalions, twenty-seven companies, and nine platoons composed of ethnic Koreans.    On active duty, there are: two divisional, five regimental, eighty-seven battalion, 598 company, 400 platoon, and 1,900 squad commanders of Korean descent.    Within the ranks of the PLA they all are receiving training and education and, under the guidance of their Chinese comrades, have made much progress. From our military, many of these soldiers have gained experience in carrying out operations, establishing armed forces, and launching political work. We feel most of them are fit to be cadres. After our army moved to South China, however, there was rioting among some of the ethnic Koreans; they demanded to be sent home [to Korea]. Nevertheless, the majority of these men continued to follow orders and unwaveringly pushed southward. At present the war is almost over. In the interests of the Korean people we should send these trained cadres back to Korea (those wishing to stay may stay). Would the Central Committee please discuss and relay to the Korean Workers' Party as to if they may or may not be sent home at this time. If the answer is affirmative, we will assemble them into one standard division or four or five standard regiments and, after a brief period of training, will send them home.Please give instructions.               Lin BiaoDeng ZihuiTan Zhen.""25 December 1949","['Nie, Rongzhen, 1899-']","['Korean War, 1950-1953', 'China--Foreign relations--Korea (North)', 'Repatriation--Korea (North)', 'Korean War, 1950-1953--China', 'China--Military relations--Korea (North)']"

A report to Kim Il Sung was received from the ambassador of the DPRK in the Chinese People's Republic Ri Ju-yeon [Ri Ju Yon] in which he reports about a meeting between Mao Zedong and Ri Ju-yeon that took place in Beijing at the end of March 1950.In the conversation between Mao Zedong and Ri Ju-yeon, at the initiative of the latter, the question of a meeting between Kim Il Sung and Mao Zedong was discussed.Mao Zedong responded positively to the question of a meeting with Kim Il Sung and selected the end of April or the beginning of May of this year as the approximate time for his meeting.Mao Zedong connected the proposed meeting with the question of the unification of Korea, indicating in this regard that if there is a concrete plan for the unification of Korea, then the meeting should be organized secretly [not openly], but if there is not yet such a plan for unification of Korea, then the meeting with Kim Il Sung can be conducted officially.Ri Ju-yeon has not given a concrete answer to the question of the time and form of the meeting, referring to the fact that Kim Il Sung is presently undergoing medical treatment. Further, Mao said in the conversation with Ri Ju-yeon that if a third world war begins, Korea will not escape participation in it, therefore the Korean People's Democratic Republic should prepare its armed forces.In the conversation with Ri Ju-yeon, Mao Zedong expressed the wish to develop wider trade between the Chinese People's Republic and the DPRK.2. Kim Chaek has reported that Kim Dal-seon [Kim Dal Son], the leader of the partisan detachments in the south of Korea whom the southern press and radio have repeatedly officially reported as killed in battles with punitive units of the South Korean army, arrived in Pyongyang from South Korea on April 3.Kim Dal-seon came to North Korea to report about the position of the partisan movement in South Korea and to receive orders on this question.Kim Chaek asked me to transmit the above indicated questions to Kim Il Sung through Comrade Shtykov.10.IV.50.

Organs of power are being created everywhere--even the reactionary elements did not take action against the measures of the government of the DPRK and the People's Army.The successful attack of the People's Army activated the partisans, at present the partisan movement is developing widely in the rear of the South Korean army.However, in connection with the widespread American propaganda over the radio, which is directed against the DPRK, and the frequent attacks by American planes on population points, industrial and military sites in North and South Korea, the political mood of the population is somewhat worsening.Individual attitudes of lack of belief in the final victory have appeared, and in the liberated regions a certain (small) portion of the population is taking a wait and see position.The leadership of the DPRK and the People's Army (Kim Il Sung, Pak Heon-yeong [Pak Hon Yong], Pak Il-u [Pak Il U], Kim Baek, Choe Yeungeun [Choe Yung Un], Kang Geun) correctly evaluate the complicated military-political situation in Korea, believe in full victory and are directing all efforts toward a subsequent broad attack on the south of Korea.KIM IL SUNG and PAK HEON-YEONG understand the difficulties for Korea elicited by the entrance of the Americans into the war against the DPRK and in connection with this they are taking the necessary measures to stabilize human and material resources for the war.KIM IL SUNG asked my opinion about forming additional infantry, tank, and naval units and formations. They intend to introduce universal military service in the DPRK.However, some portion of the leading figures, including KIM DU-BONG [Kim Tu Bong], GWON MIN-GI [Kwon Min Ki] are speaking about the difficulties of conducting a war against the Americans with the forces of Korea and in a cautious way have tried to ascertain from KIM IL SUNG the position of the Soviet Union on this question. (The secretary of KIM IL SUNG reported to me these facts, about a conversation of KIM DU-BONG and GWON MIN-GI with KIM IL SUNG.)The rightist and centrist figures that are entering the government of the DPRK are supporting all measures of the government, but so far are not displaying the necessary direction of activity in the mobilization of their parties in the south of the country.I communicated to KIM IL SUNG that the government of the USSR has satisfied his request for arms and ammunition. The general situation in the KNP [Korean People's Republic, apparently a misspelling of DPRK] continues to remain favorable and makes it possible to continue the active offensive of the People's Army.

In his opinion the troops are moving very slowly, especially in the Central direction. The troop crossing was disorganized, although there was a minister in place there. He expressed dissatisfaction with his [the minister's] work.Further, noting the seriousness of the situation at the front and in the liberated territories and the danger of landings by American troops in the rear or at North Korean ports or airborne landings of troops, he asked me to report to you his request for quick delivery of arms in the following amounts: 50,000 rifles; 5,000 PPSh sub-machine guns, 5,000 PPS [sub-machine guns]; 1,500 light machine guns; 350 heavy machine guns; 200 82mm mortars; 78 120mm mortars, 80 76mm ZIS-3 artillery pieces; 24 122mm howitzers; 60 37mm anti- aircraft guns; 120 machine guns; 500 trucks.All these arms are needed for the formation of two divisions, 12 battalions of marines and for the formation of security detachments.Because of American air attacks on the railroad stations in the region of Kanko [Hamheung], Seisin [Cheongjin], he asked that the arms be sent on an accelerated schedule through Manchuria [along the route of] Andong-Sinuiju-Pyongyang.He also communicated that they have begun fitting out reserve regiments and 2 tank brigades and that these need arms and tanks.Further in the conversation he asked advice about how better to organize troop command in the complicated situation. Since the People's Army is fighting against American troops, he considers it necessary to strengthen the leadership of the army.Further he asked advice about how better to organize troop command and what kind of organizational command structure to choose so that the General Staff is brought closer to the troops.After consulting with General VASILIEV we proposed the following structure:1. To create two army groups headed by Military Councils composed of: a commander, a member of the Military Council and a chief of staff.To place 4-6 units under the command of each army group.2. To create a front headquarters headed by a commander of the front, a chief of staff and a member of the Military Council of the front.The front headquarters should be created from [the facilities and personnel of] the General Staff.3. To preserve the Ministry of National Defense, since it already exists only in a reduced form.The Ministry's task should be the supply of combat troops with everything needed (foodstuffs, fuel, transport, ammunition) as well as the training of reserves, new troop formation and the organization of anti-aircraft defense for the northern part of the republic.4. To appoint Kim Il Sung as Supreme Commander of troops. He agreed with our proposals.The restructuring will proceed without harm to the military operations on the front.He then asked our opinion about how best to arrange the disposition of commanding cadres.From my part I proposed to appoint the following group commanders: Deputy Minister in charge of artillery Mu Deun for the left flank group, and for the commander of the right flank group Kim Gu, Deputy Chief of the General Staff (presently commanding an operational group). To appoint as commander of the front the Deputy Chairman of the Cabinet of Ministers and Minister of Industry, Kim Chaek (he knows military affairs, was a partisan and served in the Chinese brigade in Khabarovsk, is a very strong-willed, thoughtful and brave man).To appoint as Chief of Staff of the front Gang Geun, who is now Chief of the General Staff.The Minister of National Defense will remain in his post. He will manage the formation of new units and the organization of anti-landing defense, and also supplying troops with everything needed.They want this measure to be passed through the military committee on July 4 or 5. I judge that in this complicated situation this measure will yield positive results.The staff of the front will move to Seoul in the near future.I ask your permission:1. To have two advisers in every army group (adviser for the group commander and adviser for the artillery commander).2. I ask your permission for the main military adviser Comrade VASILIEV to go to Seoul with a group of officers, together with the staff of the front, and to be permanently located there with the staff.3.

These two requests are in accord with the spirit of the Sino-Soviet treaty.  Our side has agreed.  As to the detailed means, after discussion with Roshchin, the following agreement was reached: concerning rail transport, no matter whether (they) enter the country from Manzhouli or the Suifen River via Haerbin, Changchun and Shenyang to Lüda, or to Andong and then to Korea, Yu Guangsheng will need to be informed in advance by either the Soviet side’s Vice-Chair of the Chinese Changchun Railway’s Administrative Committee or the Soviet side’s Chinese Changchun Railway Bureau Director so that vehicles can be dispatched in time to avoid holding things up.  Our side authorizes Yu Guangsheng to handle this and report to the Railway Department in a timely manner.  Concerning the air transport question, the Soviet side has decided to utilize the Shenyang Aviation Institute to augment Soviet personnel, strengthen ground-air communications and report on Soviet planes crossing the border, to avoid any misunderstanding.  On our side, the Military Commission has decided to transfer Duan Suquan to (the position) of Northeast Region Air Force Commander, and has instructed Duan Suquan to establish contact immediately with the Soviet advisor at the Shengyang Aviation Institute and to report in a timely manner to the Military Commission Air Force Headquarters.  [Chinese Communist] Party Central CommitteeJuly 11",['Chinese Communist Party Central Committee (CCP CC)'],"['Korean War, 1950-1953', 'Korean War, 1950-1953--Soviet Union', 'China--Foreign relations--Soviet Union', 'Korean War, 1950-1953--China', 'China--Military relations--Soviet Union']"

If he demands it in written form—give it to him in written form, but without my signature.1. The CC VKP(b) [Central Committee, All-Union Communist Party (bolshevik)] salutes Comrade Kim Il Sung and his friends for the great liberational struggle of the Korean people which comrade Kim Il Sung is leading with brilliant success. CC VKP(b) has no doubt that in the soonest time the interventionists will be driven out of Korea with ignominy.2. Comrade Kim Il Sung should not be embarrassed by the fact that he does not have solid successes in the war against the interventionists, that the successes are sometimes interrupted by delays in the advance or even by some local set-backs. In such a war continuous successes do not occur. The Russians also did not have continuous successes during the civil war and even more during the war with Germany. The greatest success of the Korean people is that Korea has now become the most popular country in the world and has turned into the banner of the movement in Asia for liberation from the imperialist yoke. The armies of all enslaved peoples will now learn from the Korean People's Army the art of bringing decisive blows to the Americans and to any imperialists. Moreover, Comrade Kim Il Sung should not forget that Korea is not alone now, that it has allies, who are rendering and will render it aid. The position of the Russians during the Anglo-French-American intervention in 1919 was several times worse than the position of the Korean comrades at the present time.3. Advise Comrade Kim Il Sung not to scatter the air force, but to concentrate it on the front. It is necessary that each attack by the People's Army on any portion of the front begin with a number of decisive blows by attack planes on the troops of the enemy, that the fighter planes defend the troops of the Peoples Army from the blows of the enemy planes as much as possible. If it is necessary, we can throw in additional assault aircraft and fighter aircraft for the Korean air force.Feng Xi [Stalin]28 August 1950No. 483/shCopy No. 1 To Stalin","['Stalin, Joseph, 1879-1953']","['Air defenses', 'Korea (North)--Armed Forces', 'Korean War, 1950-1953', 'Anti-imperialist movements', 'Korea (North)--Foreign relations--Soviet Union', 'Korean War, 1950-1953--Soviet Union', 'Military assistance, Soviet']"

39,Telegram from Zhou Enlai to Ni Zhiliang,19500920,"Comrade Ni Zhiliang:This is to acknowledge receipt of the September 18 telegram.  Please tell Comrade Kim Il Sung: We think your idea of fighting a protracted war is correct.  The courage of the North Korean army and masses is admirable.  Enemy numbers will probably increase at Inchon, the purpose of which is to extend their lines to the east and cut North Korea’s north-south transportation lines and also press on towards the 38th Parallel.  The People’s Army must do all it can to hold the area north of the 38th Parallel; [only in this way] will it be possible to carry on a protracted war.  Therefore, please think about the question of how to preserve [your] main forces under the general policy of persisting in relying on one’s own efforts and fighting for a long period of time so that the enemy can be destroyed one by one.  At present, [your] main force directly faces the enemy’s positions and both sides hold their ground.  This means much consumption [of resources.]  And if the enemy seizes Seoul, there is the danger that the People’s Army’s route of retreat will be cut off.  Therefore, it seems appropriate that the main force of the People’s Army should concentrate [but maintain] mobility, seek the enemy’s weak points and destroy the enemy part by part.  In battles, [you should] concentrate military strength.  In every battle, pin down large numbers of the enemy in divided branches with less military strength or firepower while using more military strength [three to five times] and firepower [at least twice] with absolute superiority to surround and annihilate fewer enemies (e.g. one regiment) that have been divided by us.  In battles, division of one’s forces should be avoided; most of all to be avoided is putting the enemy to flight or blocking the enemy instead of destroying the enemy’s effective strength.  So long as you can wipe out the enemy’s effective strength, annihilating only one regiment or one battalion is still good.  A big victory results from the accumulation of small victories.  They will progressively weaken the enemy and are beneficial in protracted war. If the US army’s firepower and equipment is strong and it is temporarily difficult to charge in and break it up, it is suitable to consider targeting the Syngman Rhee puppet army [by] concentrating [your] main force and annihilating one or two regiments every time, [thereby] annihilating one or two divisions every few months.  In half a year, the puppet army can be destroyed completely.  These lackeys of American imperialism will be cut off, which will isolate the American imperialists and then [you can] annihilate them separately.  Under the principles of protracted war, [one] must fully take into account the difficult side.  Long term planning must be made in all aspects of mobilization and usage of manpower, material resources and financial resources and lower-level subordinates must be made to avoid the mentality of putting all one’s eggs in one basket.  The enemy seeks a quick decision [in the war] and is afraid of it becoming protracted, while our People’s Army should avoid quick decisions and can only gain victory in a protracted war.  As friends and comrades, we provide the above for your reference.  Correct or not, [I] request [your] further consideration and reply.Zhou EnlaiSeptember 20","['Zhou, Enlai, 1898-1976 ']","['Korea (North)--Armed Forces', 'Korean War, 1950-1953', 'China--Foreign relations--Korea (North)', 'Korea (North)--Military policy', 'Korean War, 1950-1953--China', 'China--Military relations--Korea (North)']"

The troops lack ammunition and fuel the delivery of which has been virtually halted. The accounting for the available weapons and ammunition is organized unsatisfactorily. The top-down command and control system is set up poorly. The wire and radio communications work intermittently because of the interruptions inflicted by the enemy's air raids and due to the lack of qualified radio operators and the lack of fuel for radio station generators correspondingly. Courier mail is almost nonexistent.The predicament of the KPA troops, in particular on the Southeastern front, remains unclear.Upon our recommendation, on the night of 26.9.50 [26 September 1950], some Korean communications officers were dispatched to the Front Command and the Seoul group in order to collect information on the troops' situation.On 25.9.50, at 19:00 pm, local time, Kim Il Sung's order was forwarded to the troops, according to which the Seoul grouping and the Second Army Group operating in the northern part of the southeastern front were told to go on the defensive and hold up the enemy by any means.The troops of the Second Army Group operating in the central and southern parts of the southeastern front were ordered to begin general retreat northwestward with the aim of getting to the area of Jincheon, Daejon, Boeon for further leveling off the front line approximately following the line Seoul, Yeosu, Cheongju, Bonghwa, Uljin [in Russian translation: Seoul, Reisiu, Tsiusiu, Naidzio, Urutsin].On 26.9.50, KIM IL SUNG received our group.The meeting was also attended by Foreign Minister PAK HEON-YEONG [Pak Hon Yong] and Comrade SHTYKOV.As a result of our conversation, KIM IL SUNG decided to combine the duties of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief and Defense Minister in his hands, to set up a Staff Office for the Supreme Commander-in-Chief for the command and control over troops, and to pay serious attention to the work of the rear.At present, they have begun to form only six infantry divisions in the northern part of Korea, whereas the current military situation has made impossible the formation of nine infantry divisions manned with the Southerners.KIM IL SUNG issued a directive to take immediate steps aimed at withdrawing the remaining KPA troops from South Korea so that to use it to form new divisions in North Korea and deny this opportunity to the South.In connection with the fact that the Chinese railroads are overloaded transporting supplies to Korea, it is desirable that the armaments designated for use by the six divisions which are being newly formed be shipped first, and only then should the ammunition be delivered.After our conversation with KIM IL SUNG we got down to work in order to assist in:- organizing good command and control over troops;- rearranging the system of troop supplies, shipments, and transport services;- preparing defensive fortifications. The People's Army is experiencing a dire shortage of drivers. The 3,400 trucks which are to arrive soon have no drivers at all. It may be expedient to propose to Kim Il Sung that he ask the Chinese friends to dispatch not less than 1,500 drivers to Korea, may it not?MATVEYEV [ZAKHAROV]# 1298/sh09/27/5012:35pm, Pyongyang timeTyped by Budanova on 28.9.50 at 0:15 a.m.","['Zakharov, M.

The adversary, suffering one defeat after another, was cornered into a tiny piece of land at the southern-most tip of South Korea and we had a great chance of winning a victory in the last decisive battles.Such a situation considerably damaged the military authority of the United States. Therefore, in those conditions, in order to restore its prestige and to implement by any means its long-held plans of conquering Korea and transforming it into its militarily strategic bridgehead, on 16.9.50, the U.S. performed an assault landing operation and landed a considerable number of troops and armaments in the vicinity of Incheon after having mobilized almost all its land, naval, and air troops deployed in the Pacific ocean. The enemy took over Incheon and is engaged in street combats in the city of Seoul itself. The military situation became perilous. The units of our People's Army heroically fight against advancing assault landing units of the enemy. However, we consider it necessary to report to You about the emergence of very unfavorable conditions for us.The enemy's air force numbering about a thousand airplanes of various types, facing no rebuff from our side, totally dominate the air space and perform air raids at the fronts and in the rear day and night. At the fronts, under the air cover of hundreds of airplanes the motorized units of the enemy engage us in combat at their free will and inflict great losses to our manpower and destroy our armaments. Moreover, by freely destroying railroads and highways, telegraph and telephone communications lines, means of transportation and other facilities, the enemy's air force impedes the provision of supplies to our combat units and bars maneuvers by our troops, thereby making their timely redeployments impossible. We experience this difficulty on all fronts.Having cut off all the communications lines of our troops and joined the assault force that landed in Incheon with the units of their southern front that broke through our frontline, the adversary has a real opportunity to take over the city of Seoul completely.As a result, the units of the People's Army that are still fighting in the southern part of Korea have been cut off from the northern part of Korea, they are torn into pieces and cannot receive munitions, armaments, and food rations. Moreover, some units do not have any communication with each other, while some of them are surrounded by enemy troops.After taking over Seoul completely, the enemy is likely to launch a further offensive into North Korea. Therefore, we believe that if in future the above-mentioned conditions unfavorable to us continue, then the American aggression ultimately will be successful. In order to provide troops with all the necessary supplies and to feed the frontline without any interruption, first of all, we need to have an appropriate air force. But we do not possess well-trained pilots.Dear Comrade STALIN, we are determined to overcome all the difficulties facing us so that Korea will not be a colony and a military springboard of the U.S. imperialists. We will fight for the independence, democracy and happiness of our people to the last drop of blood. Therefore, with all our energy we are taking decisive measures for the formation and training of many new divisions with the aim of using more than 100,000 troops mobilized in South Korea[captured in South Korea - AM] in the most advantageous operational areas, as well as arming the entire people so as to be prepared to fight a protracted war.This notwithstanding, if the enemy does not give us time to implement the measures which we plan, and, making use of our extremely grave situation, steps up its offensive operations into North Korea, then we will not be able to stop the enemy troops solely with our own forces.Therefore, dear Iosif Vissarionovich, we cannot help asking You to provide us with special assistance. In other words, at the moment when the enemy troops cross over the 38th parallel we will badly need direct military assistance from the Soviet Union.If for any reason this is impossible, please assist us by forming international volunteer units in China and other countries of people's democracy for rendering military assistance to our struggle.We request Your directive regarding the aforementioned proposal.

In the beginning of the conversation KIM IL SUNG asked me whether I was aware of the military situation at the front.I replied that I did not know the latest one.Then KIM IL SUNG briefly explained to me the predicament of his troops on the basis of the report of the Front Commander and asked my advice as to what one could do in order to improve the situation at the front. KIM IL SUNG believes that in the wake of the enemy's having occupied the Syarye mountain range and moving into the rear of the Second Army Group the front situation is becoming particularly troublesome. Earlier they hoped that they would be able to withdraw troops in an organized manner. But because of their poor discipline and failure to fulfill orders, the enemy managed to cut off the First Army Group and is moving to cut off the Second Army Group by its breakthrough toward P'UNGGI [BUNKEI] and JIJYON [TISEN].The situation in Seoul is also murky. His orders notwithstanding, CHOE YONG-GEON [Choe Yong Gon] does not report anything, despite the fact that a line of communications with him is available.I replied that it was hard for me to advise anything regarding this matter because I did not know the predicament of the KPA troops and their location, however, I would consider it expedient for KIM IL SUNG to take urgent steps to organize defense along the 38th parallel, including immediate deployment of troops at the already prepared fortifications there.KIM IL SUNG asked me, how do you consider [the situation], will the adversary cross the 38th parallel northward? I replied that it was not clear yet, but that they had to undertake urgent measures to set up defenses along the 38th parallel.KIM IL SUNG reiterated his earlier stated desire to unify the country by his own means, he stated that he wanted to form 15 divisions and to continue the struggle, but it was not clear for him whether the adversary would cross the 38th parallel or not. Should the enemy cross the 38th parallel, they [the North Korean leadership - AM] would be unable to form new troops and they would have no means to render any serious resistance to the enemy.In this connection, he would like to ask my advice regarding his letter to Comrade STALIN. They discussed this idea and want to send the letter.I responded that I could give no advice on this matter. At that moment, PAK HEON-YEONG joined the conversation and said that they had already drafted a letter, that the WPKs Political Council had discussed it, and they wanted to familiarize me with its content.I dodged the reading by saying that it was up to the Political Council what its members were going to write in their letter.On 28.9.50, [A.I.] SHABSHIN, a member of MATVEYEV'S group, told MATVEYEV and myself that at a chance meeting with PAK HEON-YEONG the latter told him that the Political Council had discussed and adopted a text of the letter addressed to comrade Stalin, containing a request to aid Korea with air support.PAK informed SHABSHIN that they had dispatched a letter in reply to MAO ZEDONG which contained a hint about aid.It was obvious that they [Kim and Pak] were not satisfied with my earlier reply and they did not know what to do with their letter to Comrade STALIN.KIM IL SUNG and PAK HEON-YEONG are nervous. In the present difficult situation one can feel some confusion and hopelessness.The military situation has worsened dramatically lately. The adversary managed tocut off the entire First Army Group composed of six divisions and two brigades, as well as, by advancing to the vicinity of CHEONGJU, to cut off the Second Army Group composed of 7 divisions. Seoul fell. There are no standby troops ready to render any serious resistance to the enemy advancing to the 38th parallel.New military units being formed in the North advance to the frontline very slowly because the railroads in fact do not function due to the demolished bridges and ruined railway stations, while automobile transport is scarce.These new units lack armaments. The newly formed units and groupings designated to defend JEMULPO (Incheon), HAEJU, WONSAN, and CHEONGJIN have weapons designed for training purposes only.The political situation is also getting more and more complicated. The enemy stepped up its activity of dropping paratroopers into the territory of North Korea with the task of gathering intelligence on what deliveries are being shipped from the Soviet Union and to conduct subversive activities. Reactionary forces are raising their heads in North Korea.

Gromykochief of the 4th Department of the 8th Directorate of the Armed Forces General Staff [illegible signature]Moscow - the KremlinDEARIosif Vissarionovich STALINIn the name of the Korean Worker’s Party we send you, the liberator of the Korean people and leader of the working people of the entire world, deep appreciation for the sympathy and aid which you constantly give our people who are fighting for the freedom and independence of our homeland.In this letter we would like to briefly inform you of the situation at the present time on the fronts of the war of liberation of our people against the American aggressors.Before the amphibious operations in the region of Incheon (Chemulpo) the situation at the fronts could not be assessed as unfavorable for us.The enemy, suffering defeat after defeat, was driven into a small territory in the very south of South Korea and we had a great chance of victory in subsequent decisive battles.Such a situation badly shook the military authority of the US.Therefore in the situation that had been created the US with the goal of restoring its authority and accomplishing its long-held plans to seize Korea at any cost and turn it into its strategic military bridgehead, mobilizing almost all the ground, naval, and air forces in the Pacific Ocean, made an amphibious operation on 16 September 1950 and landed a considerable amount of troops and equipment in the region of Incheon. The enemy seized Incheon and is waging street battles right in the city of Seoul.A threatening situation has been created. Units of our People’s Army are fighting heroically against advancing assault units of the enemy. However, we consider it necessary to report to you about the very unfavorable conditions for us.Enemy aviation numbering about 1,000 aircraft of different types, completely rule the air without encountering any resistance from our part, and have daily made round-the-clock raids at the fronts and in the rear.At the fronts motorized units of the enemy under the protection of hundreds of aircraft maneuver freely, inflicting great losses in manpower and equipment. At the same time enemy aircraft, freely destroying railroads and highways, telegraph and telephone communications, transportation equipment, and other facilities, are interrupting the supply of operational units and pinning down the operations of our troops, making it impossible for the units to make timely maneuvers. We are this difficulty is being experienced on all fronts.Having cut all the communications of our units and linked up the assault troops which landed in the region of Incheon with the units of the southern front which have broken through our front, the enemy has a real chance of completely occupying the city of Seoul.As a result of this units of the People’s Army in the southern part of Korea have been cut off from the northern part by the enemy, and also units in South Korea have been smashed into pieces and they can not now receive ammunition, weapons, and food. And what is more, some units cannot communicate with one another, and part are surrounded by enemy forces.With the complete occupation of Seoul the enemy obviously will undertake a further offensive on North Korea. Concerning this, we think that if conditions unfavorable to us continue to occur the American aggression will in the final account be successful.In order to supply the troops with everything necessary and to feed the front without interruption we need to have appropriate air forces most of all. But we have no trained personnel.Dear Cde. STALIN! We are fully determined to overcome all the difficulties with which we are faced so that Korea not be a colony or bridgehead of American imperialism. We will fight to the last drop of blood for the independence, democracy, and happiness of our people. Therefore we are taking vigorous measures with all [our] energy to form and train a multitude of new divisions to use the more than 100,000 troops mobilized in South Korea in more favorable operational regions, and to arm all the people in order to be ready for a long war.In spite of this, if the enemy does not give [us] time to take the steps we have planned and, making use of our extraordinarily difficult situation, forces offensive operations on North Korea, then we will not be able to stop the enemy with our own forces.Therefore, dear Iosif Vissarionovich, we cannot fail to ask you for special assistance. In other words, at the moment enemy troops cross the 38th parallel we [will] very much need the direct military assistance from the Soviet Union.If this is impossible for some reason then give us aid in the creation of international volunteer units in China and other countries of people’s democracy to give military assistance to our fight.We request your instructions about our proposals aboveSincerely, the CC of the Korean Worker’s PartyKIM IL SUNG, PAK HEON-YEONG29 September 1950Sent by Shcherbakova at 0145 1 October 1940 (26)","['Kim, Il Sung', 'Pak, Heon-yeong', 'Shtykov, Terentiĭ Fomich, 1907-1964']","['Korean War, 1950-1953', 'Korea (North)--Military relations--Soviet Union', 'Military assistance, Soviet--Korea (North)']"

However, judging by the information that I have received from Moscow today, I see that the situation of our Korean friends is getting desperate.It was on 16 September already that Moscow warned our Korean friends that the landing of the U.S. troops at Jemulpo [Incheon] had great significance and was aimed at cutting off the First and Second Army Groups of the North Koreans from their rear in the North. Moscow admonished them to withdraw at least four divisions from the South immediately, to set up a front line to the north and east of Seoul, and later to gradually pull out most of the troops fighting in the South northward, thereby providing for the defense of the 38th parallel. However, the 1 [First] and 2 [Second] Army Groups' Commands failed to implement Kim Il Sung's order for the withdrawal of troops northward, which allowed the U.S. troops to cut them off and surround them. Our Korean friends have no troops capable of resistance in the vicinity of Seoul. Hence, one needs to consider the way toward the 38th parallel wide open.I think that if in the current situation you consider it possible to send troops to assist the Koreans, then you should move at least five-six divisions toward the 38th parallel at once so as to give our Korean comrades an opportunity to organize combat reserves north of the 38th parallel under the cover of your troops. The Chinese divisions could be considered as volunteers, with Chinese in command at the head, of course.I have not informed and am not going to inform our Korean friends about this idea, but I have no doubt in my mind that they will be glad when they learn about it.I await your reply.Greetings,F I L I P P O V [STALIN]1 October 1950","['Stalin, Joseph, 1879-1953']","['Chinese People’s Liberation Army', 'Korea (North)--Armed Forces', 'Korean War, 1950-1953', 'Korea (North)--Foreign relations--Soviet Union', 'China--Foreign relations--Korea (North)', 'Korean War, 1950-1953--Soviet Union', 'China--Foreign policy', 'China--Foreign relations--Soviet Union', 'China--Armed Forces']"

We originally planned to move several volunteer divisions to North Korea to render assistance to the Korean comrades when the enemy advanced north of the 38th parallel.However, having thought this over thoroughly, we now consider that such actions may entail extremely serious consequences.In the first place, it is very difficult to resolve the Korean question with a few divisions (our troops are extremely poorly equipped, there is no confidence in the success of military operations against American troops), the enemy can force us to retreat.In the second place, it is most likely that this will provoke an open conflict between the USA and China, as a consequence of which the Soviet Union can also be dragged into war, and the question would thus become extremely large [kraine bol'shim].Many comrades in the CC CPC [Central Committee of the Communist Party of China] judge that it is necessary to show caution here.Of course, not to send out troops to render assistance is very bad for the Korean comrades, who are presently in such difficulty, and we ourselves feel this keenly; but if we advance several divisions and the enemy forces us to retreat; and this moreover provokes an open conflict between the USA and China, then our entire plan for peaceful construction will be completely ruined, and many people in the country will be dissatisfied (the wounds inflicted on the people by the war have not yet healed, we need peace).Therefore it is better to show patience now, refrain from advancing troops, [and] actively prepare our forces, which will be more advantageous at the time of war with the enemy.Korea, while temporarily suffering defeat, will change the form of the struggle to partisan war.We will convene a meeting of the CC, at which will be present the main comrades of various bureaus of the CC. A final decision has not been taken on this question. This is our preliminary telegram, we wish to consult with you. If you agree, then we are ready immediately to send by plane Comrades ZHOU ENLAI and LIN BIAO to your vacation place, to talk over this matter with you and to report the situation in China and Korea.We await your reply.MAO ZEDONG 2.10.50”1. In our view MAO ZEDONG's answer is indicative of a change in the original position of the Chinese leadership on the Korean question. It contradicts the earlier appraisal, which was repeatedly expressed in conversations of MAO ZEDONG with YUDIN, KOTOV and KONNOV; [and] LIU SHAOQI with me, which were reported at the time. In these conversations, it was noted by them that the people and the PLA [People's Liberation Army] are ready to help the Korean people, the fighting spirit of the PLA is high and it is able, if necessary, to defeat the American troops, regarding them as weaker than the Japanese.2. The Chinese government undoubtedly could send to Korea not only five-six battle ready divisions, but even more. It goes without saying that these Chinese troops are in need of some technical equipping in antitank weapons and to some extent in artillery.The reasons for the changes in the position of the Chinese are not yet clear to us. It is possible to suppose that it has been influenced by the international situation, the worsening of the position in Korea, [and] the intrigues of the Anglo-American bloc through [Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal] NEHRU, who has urged the Chinese toward patience and abstention [from intervention] in order to avoid catastrophe.ROSHCHINNo. 2270 3.10_______________________Dec[iphered by] Araushkin 12.50 3.10 [12.50 p.m. 3 October]Typ[ed by] Doronchenkova 13.20 3.10[1.20 p.m. 3 October]Typ[ed in] 10 copies [copies no.] 9-10 -(to file)","['Roshchin, Nikolai V.']","['Chinese People’s Liberation Army', 'Korea (North)--Armed Forces', 'Korean War, 1950-1953', 'Korea (North)--Foreign relations--Soviet Union', 'China--Foreign relations--Korea (North)', 'Korean War, 1950-1953--Soviet Union', 'China--Foreign relations--Soviet Union', 'China--Foreign relations--United States', 'China--Military relations--Soviet Union', 'China--Foreign relations--India']"

Mao Zedong.""Your representatives arrived today, and we senior VPK(b) officials and your representatives had an opportunity to discuss the issues of which you are aware. The following became clear from the exchange of opinions:1. The Chinese forces designated for assistance are not ready, are poorly-armed, do not have enough artillery, have no tanks, aircraft cannot be provided for protection before two months, and a minimum of six months is needed to supply and train these troops.2. If direct aid is not given within a month with a considerable quantity of well-armed troops then in view of the precariousness of the Korean units north of the 38th parallel Korea will be occupied by the Americans.3. Accordingly, substantial aid with troops can be provided to the Koreans only after six months, that is after the occupation of Korea by the Americans, that is when it will no longer be needed.In view of the above and considering the unfavorable conditions in the internal situation of China which according to the reports of Cde. Zhou Enlai would follow China's entry into the war, we have unanimously come to the following conclusions:1. In spite of favorable international conditions, in view of their unpreparedness at the present time the Chinese troops should not cross the Korean border in order not to find themselves in an unfavorable position;2. If the troops have already crossed the border they ought not to move further than the mountainous regions along the Chinese border;3. Consider it advisable for Korean units to occupy the mountainous regions north of Pyongyang and Wonsan for defense and to transfer part of the troops to partisan status in the rear of the enemy;4. Withdraw the best of the mobilized Koreans with command personnel to Manchuria quietly and in small groups where Korean divisions are to be formed from them;5. Pyongyang and other important locations south of the mountainous region of North Korea are to be immediately evacuated.As regards the tanks, artillery, and aircraft required by the Chinese comrades to reequip the Chinese army the USSR will begin to supply them in full.

Shtykov and Vasil'yevRead the following to Kim Il Sung:""Yesterday a meeting of representatives of the VKP(b) CC Politburo and representatives of the Chinese Communist Party CC Zhou Enlai and Lin Biao was held in the USSR on the issue of action by Chinese troops to help Korea. From the report of Zhou Enlai it became clear that the Chinese troops destined for Korea are not ready to act, have no tanks and very little artillery, protection from the air cannot be provided in less than two months, and that more than six months will be required to supply [them] with tanks and artillery considering the training of the troops in armor and artillery matters.In view of such a report by Zhou Enlai the meeting unanimously recognized that China can only provide aid with troops after six months.Since such aid is belated and it can only arrive after the occupation of Korea by American troops the meeting came to the conclusion that given their technical weakness and unpreparedness the Chinese forces cannot have success in Korea at the present time but, on the contrary, will find themselves in a critical position.In view of all the above the meeting of the representatives of the Chinese and Soviet CC's recommend:1. To immediately begin the evacuation of Pyongyang and other very important locations without any sort of panic;2. The Korean people's forces are to make a fighting retreat to the north, delaying the enemy, and not letting him quickly branch out to the north;3. Concentrate part of the troops in the mountainous regions north of Wonsan and Pyongyang, forming a strong defense there, and send the other part into the rear of the enemy in small detachments for partisan warfare [delo];4. Send the mobilized Koreans to form new reserve divisions across the Chinese border to Manchuria in small groups and form divisions from them there (the Chinese comrades have agreed to this);5. Send the transports that arrived with the Soviet weapons which have still not been used by the Korean comrades into the service of the Korean divisions being formed in Manchuria;6. Put all Koreans studying in the USSR into aeronautics and organize air units from them which will get aircraft from the USSR;7. Either send all Soviet advisers to the USSR or use them to form new Korean divisions in Manchuria, as Kim Il Sung sees fit.You are informed that Cde.

At present, all these questions have been clarified.Mao Zedong pointed out that now it is advantageous for them to dispatch the Chinese troops into Korea. The Chinese have the absolute obligation to send troops to Korea.At this point, they are sending the first echelon composed of nine divisions. Although it is poorly armed, it will be able to fight against the troops of Syngman Rhee. In the meantime, the Chinese comrades will have to prepare the second echelon.The main thing that we need, says Mao Zedong, is air power which shall provide us with air cover. We hope to see its arrival as soon as possible, but not later than in two months.Furthermore, Comrade Mao Zedong noted that at present the government of the People's Republic of China cannot pay in cash for the armaments delivered. They hope to receive arms on credit.Thus, the 1951 budget will not be affected, and it will be easier for them to explain it to the democrats.In conclusion, Mao Zedong stated that the leading comrades in the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party believe that the Chinese must come to the assistance of the Korean comrades in their difficult struggle.

The UK and France are very afraid of getting involved in a war with China, so are anxious.  America wants to fool [us] into an armistice so as to stabilize the front and augment its military strength in order to attack again.  Now they are worried, but we are not.  You should take the offensive.  Whenever you meet people who say North Korea should sheath the sword, do not refuse negotiations.  You can respond that, as soon as the American armies withdraw from Korea, the Korean War will cease by itself.  [You can also say] you are willing to report their opinions to Beijing.  To all who say that the Taiwan issue cannot be solved now, you should concentrate on this [point] to prove that the American imperialists’ invading North Korea and invading Taiwan are one and the same thing, and ask in reply: if the American imperialists can invade Taiwan while invading North Korea, why can’t the Chinese people assist North Korea while resisting America’s invasion of Taiwan?  In a word, you should not separate the invasion of Taiwan from the invasion of North Korea; you should not accuse [the US] of the invasion of Taiwan only while avoiding a direct answer on the North Korea [issue], should not always declare that your main task is to accuse [the US] of the invasion of Taiwan, and (should not) be afraid that talking about the North Korea issue will force us into the defendant’s position.  It should not be like this.  You should talk about the North Korea issue and the Taiwan issue with great confidence, proving at every opportunity that the American imperialists are invading North Korea and Taiwan; the UN resolution is illegal, and not allowing us to participate in the UN is disregarding 475 million Chinese people.  You should not avoid an oppositional stance in negotiations.  On the contrary, we should declare at every opportunity that no issue related to China can be solved without the Chinese joining the discussion and without the approval of Chinese representatives, therefore, any resolution [passed] or measure taken [without China’s involvement] is invalid and illegal.Zhou EnlaiSeven o’clock, December 3 [1950]","['Zhou, Enlai, 1898-1976 ']","['China--Foreign relations--Taiwan', 'China--Foreign relations--Korea (North)', 'United States--Armed Forces', 'China--Foreign relations--United States', 'United Nations--Korea', 'Korean War, 1950-1953--China', 'China--Armed Forces']"

The withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea.2. The withdrawal of American troops from the Taiwan strait and from the territory of Taiwan.3. The Korean question must be resolved by the Korean people themselves.4.

We are simultaneously sending a copy to the commanders of the corps and army Comrades Hun Xianchu, Wu Ruilin, Chzhou Biao, Pan Khe-som and to the commander of the 1st Corps NRVS and to the staff of the Northeast.1. Today (4 January) the 116th infantry division and a unit of troops from the 117th infantry division occupied the city of Seoul. Enemy troops defending Seoul withdrew to the south bank of the Han-gang river. The city of Chuncheon was also taken on 3 January by units of our 66th army.The enemy withdrew to the area of Hongcheon and to areas further south. It is supposed that the next attempt by enemy troops will be the defense of the river, which is beginning in the area of Jemulpo [Incheon], Gimpo, Iokhei, and is going on along the south bank of the Han-gang river, through Wonju, Seikheisio to Gangneung.It is possible that the enemy, regrouping behind the natural barriers, like the Han-gang river and the mountainous areas, will gather the remnants of its forces, gain time and make preparations for new military operations.Another possibility is that, in case of further more powerful strikes by our troops, the enemy will withdraw to the south.2. If we give the enemy the possibility to continue to occupy defensive positions along the south bank of the river Han-gang, to control the airport at Gimpo and to use the port at Jemulpo [Incheon] for supply, then although Seoul will be in our hands, it will be under constant threat from enemy air force and artillery, which will be extremely disadvantageous for preparing our troops for a spring offensive.If, in the presence of success, our troops make one more effort and destroy another unit of enemy troops and force the enemy to retreat from the south bank of the Han-gang river, then we not only will be able to take the Gimpo airport and control the port of Jemulpo [Incheon], but this will create more advantageous conditions for the preparation of our troops for a spring offensive.In order to achieve the aforementioned goals the following plan has been worked out:a) To leave 1 division of 1st corps of the People's Army for garrison duty in the city of Seoul.The main forces of the corps will be deployed in the area of Toto, Tok-heiri, Dzinsori, Mokudo.After rest and regrouping, in three days they must prepare to make a forced crossing of the Han-gang river and at the appropriate moment occupy the Gimpo airport, Jemulpo [Incheon] port and consolidate themselves there.b) Troops of the left column as before are under the unified command of Khan' Sian'-chu.The 50th army will continue to advance in the direction of Kosainairi, Kando, Kiriudo and the area to the northwest of these points. It will send out immediately a strong detachment to control the bridge across the Han-gang river (by a counterattack attempt to occupy the fortification before the bridge on the south bank of the Han-gang river). This detachment will find out what the situation is, make active preparations for a forced crossing of the Han-gang river, attack the enemy on the south bank and continue to carry out the battle in cooperation with the main forces. If the enemy continues to withdraw to the south, then it is necessary, while pursuing him, to occupy Suwon and to wait for further orders.The line of delimitation between the 50th army and the 1st corps of the People's Army runs through Kokusekiri, Yongsan, Kasaivairi. The line itself and the areas to the west of it belong to the 50th army, the areas to the east of this line belong to the 1st corps. The 38th, 39th and 40th armies will put themselves in order, rest for three days (until 7.1 inclusive) and prepare for a forced crossing of the Khokukan-ko river above and below Songcheon. They will first strike the enemy in the area of Iuokhei, after which they will develop an offensive along a line from the southeast to the northwest on the enemy positions in the area of Icheon, Kosiu, Suien, Yeongdeok.A detailed plan is being worked out by Comrade Hun Xianchu.c) The 42nd and 66th armies under the unified command of Wu Ruilin and Chzhou Biao, and also the 2nd and 5th corps of the People's Army under the unified command of Pan Kho-Son, in accordance with the joint forces plan established earlier, must destroy the enemy troops in the region of Hongcheon, Odzio, and afterwards await further orders.All the aforementioned troops must send spies and outposts toward the enemy troops located in front of the frontline.When the troops of the right column begin a new offensive these units must be ready to render assistance.

I send you my telegram of 28 January 1951, addressed to Comrade PENG DEHUAI.I ask you to familiarize yourself with it and communicate your opinion about whether this is advisable from the point of view of the international situation:“Comrade PENG DEHUAI!1. I received your telegram of 27 January 1951, 24:00, and your order about preparation for conducting military operations sent to all armies.2. Our troops must immediately conduct preparations for the fourth operation, with the goal of the destruction of 20,000 to 30,000 American and puppet [South Korean] troops and the occupation of the area to the north of the Daejeon-Andong boundary.3. In the course of the preparation for this operation it is necessary to hold Jemulpo, the fortification before the bridge on the south bank of the Han River and the city of Seoul, and also to draw out the main enemy forces to the Suwon-Jemulpo region. After the beginning of the operation the main forces of the North Korean and Chinese troops must break through the enemy's line of defense in the region of Wonju and make attacks in the direction toward Yeongju and Andong.4. The withdrawal of the Chinese and North Korean troops for 15-30 km to the north and the publication of a communication about support for the proposal about a temporary ceasefire is disadvantageous for us, since the enemy precisely wishes to cease military operations only at the time when our troops withdraw some distance to the north and in order that he (the enemy) can blockade the Han River.5. After the conclusion of the fourth operation, it is possible that the enemy will conduct peace negotiations with us regarding a resolution of the Korean question. Conducting negotiations will then be advantageous for China and Korea. However, the enemy at present is calculating to return the fortification before the bridge on the south bank of the Han River, to the south of the line Seoul-Jemulpo and to blockade the Han River, so that Seoul would be under threat of shelling from enemy artillery, so as thereby to force us to cease military operations and begin peace negotiations. In this way the enemy wants to place China and Korea in a disadvantageous position, which we can in no case allow.6. Our troops have not been able to receive reinforcements. Transporting troops is also inadequate. We have a very great difficulty in this regard. However, we are in a position to concentrate the main forces and with a strike in the direction of Wonju-Yeongju destroy a unit of American troops and four to five divisions of South Korean troops.I ask you explain this to a meeting of the high command. This meeting must be completely directed to the preparation of the fourth operation.7. After the Chinese and Korean troops occupy the region to the north of the Daejeon-Andong boundary, they must again make a two to three months long preparation, after which to accomplish the last, fifth, operation of decisive significance. This is advantageous in all respects.8. The ninth army group must in the near future be redeployed to the region of Pyongyang, Seoul, Jemulpo, Suwon for rest and reformation. At the same time they must fulfill the task of defending the given region so as not to give the possibility to enemy troops to land in Jemulpo and Jinnampo [Nampo]. At the time of the fifth operation the given army group must participate in military operations on the western portions of the front.9. At the time of implementing the fourth operation I ask you to think over the question of whether it will be better for the main forces of the Chinese and North Korean troops to divide into two echelons. Troops of each echelon must have a five day dry ration. Troops of the first echelon must make the breakthrough and carry out the pursuit of the enemy to a determined border, and the troops of the second echelon must continue the pursuit of the enemy, so that the operation will continue for 10-12 days and that in this time it will be possible to destroy as many enemy troops as possible.I ask you to communicate your opinion.MAO ZEDONG, 28 January 195119:00.”No. 478.28 January 1951 MAO ZEDONG",[],"['Chinese People’s Liberation Army', 'Korea (North)--Armed Forces', 'Korean War, 1950-1953', 'Korean War, 1950-1953--Armistices', 'Korea (North)--Foreign relations--Soviet Union', 'China--Foreign relations--Korea (North)', 'China--Foreign policy', 'China--Foreign relations--Soviet Union']"

It is possible to consider it incontestable that the present [North] Korean divisions are less battle capable than the old divisions in the summer of last year. This is explained by the fact that the Koreans had 10 divisions, well fitted out with officer corps and more or less satisfactorily trained. And now the Koreans have 28 divisions, of which 19 divisions are at the front and 9 are in Manchuria. It is clear that the Koreans are not in a position to supply such a large number of divisions with officer corps. According to our norms, each division, having, let's say, 8,000 men must have at least 800 officers, not counting sergeants. I have in mind the genuine officers, capable of cementing a division, and not hastily commissioned officers. It is clear that the Koreans still don't have such a number of officers. Therefore the present Korean officers are understrength, unstable and little capable of battle. The Koreans increased the number of divisions and forgot about quality, but quality plays the decisive role here.2. It would be advisable in the given situation to have not more than 23 divisions in the Korean army, so that the officer corps of the reduced 5 divisions can be used to fill out the officer corps of the remaining weak divisions, and the rank and file to use as reinforcement. This will strengthen the divisions, lessen the expenses and make for a gain in arms. The same needs to be said regarding the four Korean infantry brigades which are in poorly combat readiness and which also can be used to fill out the divisions with officers and rank and file.3. At this stage the organization of corps administration is inadvisable, since there are no, or almost no, commanders capable of leading the corps, but there are already army apparatuses. It would be better to organize the 5 army administrations with 4 divisions in each army, so that the army apparatus itself directly commands its divisions. In this case the Korean armed forces would have in its composition 5 armies (in all 20 divisions), and 3 divisions could be in the reserve of the main command for assisting the most needy armies according to the course of the operation. With time, when the commanders mature, when there will be enough of them and when they learn to command joint divisions, then it will be possible to transfer to a corps system.Of course, this reform should not be carried out now, but during a time of rest after conducting the operation.Discuss these proposals and communicate your opinion.30 Jan 1951FENG XI [FYN SI; Stalin]No. 4/854Copies: Stalin, Vasilevsky, Shtemenko[...]","['Stalin, Joseph, 1879-1953']","['Korea (North)--Armed Forces', 'Korean War, 1950-1953', 'Korea (North)--Foreign relations--Soviet Union', 'Korea (North)--Military relations--Soviet Union', 'Korean War, 1950-1953--Soviet Union', 'Korean War, 1950-1953--China', ""Korean People's Army""]"

Three questions were raised:First—about an armistice. We recognized that an armistice is now advantageous.Second—about military advisers. If they are very necessary to you, then we are ready to satisfy you.Third—about the delivery of arms for sixteen divisions. There will not be objections from our side.I won't write about the details, since your representatives will report to you about them.We consider it absolutely necessary now to start moving at least eight fighter aviation divisions from the sixteen Chinese divisions. We think that besides two or three aviation divisions of MIG-15s, you could take to the front from central and southern China five or six divisions of MIG-9's, which operate very effectively against bombers. Eight fighter divisions on your front could fully satisfy the needs of the front. According to our information your pilots are already ready to fly. It is necessary to put them into battle more quickly, so that they will be not paper pilots, but battle pilots. We trained our pilots for action at the front in five months. Seven to eight months of training is fully sufficient for the Chinese pilots. We consider this to be the main question now for your front. After the end of the conversation we received information that the Anglo-Americans intend to appeal soon to you and to the Koreans in the name of the sixteen nations fighting against Korea with a proposal about an armistice. But before making this proposal they want to strike a blow against our troops. It is possible that these are merely rumors, but it is fully possible and probable that these are not merely rumors, but corresponds to reality.

Comrade Gao Gang has returned and transmitted your opinion on various questions.I consider that they are all correct and we must do precisely thus.As regards the question of planting rubber trees, we intend immediately to start the planning.I hope that the Soviet government will send its representatives to assist us in formulating plans.2. Our troops' eight months of experience in conducting war in Korea has clearly shown the great difference in the equipment of our troops and the troops of the enemy and the extreme necessity of improving the equipment of our troops. This is why we commissioned Comrade Gao Gang to appeal to you with a request about delivery to us of arms for sixty divisions, to which you agreed. This is the minimal requirement of our troops in Korea for the present year.Upon his return Gao Gang said that you consider our requirements in arms for each division insufficient and proposed to strengthen each division with tanks and artillery.I consider this completely correct. This is necessary in war against imperialists.I already sent a telegram to Comrade Xu Xiangqian [with instructions] to conduct the negotiations fully in accordance with your opinion.3. According a telegram received from Comrade Xu Xiangqian after his preliminary negotiations with representatives of the Soviet General Staff, of the total quantity of arms for sixty divisions according to the calculation of the Soviet General Staff, arms for only sixteen divisions will be delivered this year (including for three Korean [divisions]), and arms for the remaining forty-four divisions will be delivered in 1952-1953. This is in contradiction to the needs and time frame of the Korean theater of military operations.4. For the goal of satisfying the urgent needs of the Korean theater of military operations, I ask you to study the applications transmitted by Comrade Gao Gang to Comrade Xu Xiangqian, and explore the possibility of fulfilling all deliveries of rifles, artillery, tanks, airplanes, automobiles, spare parts for automobiles and GSM, medicines and other military equipment, at 1/6 [of the total] monthly, from July to the end of the year, so that the various military units in the Korean theater of military operations receive replenishment according to the presently existing organizational structure, what is advantageous for the conduct of military operations.5. With the availability this year of deliveries of arms according to our applications, the missing quantity of arms needed for units in accordance with the new organizational structure proposed by the Soviet General Staff can be delivered in the next year. Simultaneously with this, in accordance with the delivery of arms, we will reorganize the selections for this division and in that way gradually convert the sixteen divisions to the new organization.6. We have delayed our applications for three months and have thus brought great harm to ourselves. Today we suddenly have appealed to you with such large numbers and want all this to be delivered in six months. This places before you great difficulties, especially in the area of transport.

This communication must be signed by the Command of the Korean People's Army and the command of the Chinese volunteer units, consequently by Comrade KIM IL SUNG and Comrade PENG DEHUAI. If there is no signature of the commander of the Chinese volunteer units, then the Americans will not attach any significance to only one Korean signature. It is necessary decisively to refuse the Danish hospital ship in the area of Wonsan as a place of meeting. It is necessary to demand that the meeting take place at the 38th parallel in the region of Gaeseong [Kaesong]. Keep in mind that at the present time you are the bosses of the affair of an armistice and the Americans will be forced to make concessions on the question of a place for the meeting.Send to Ridgway today an answer roughly like this:“To the commander of UN troops General RIDGWAY. Your statement of 28 June regarding an armistice has been received. We are authorized to declare to you that we agree to a meeting with your representatives for negotiations about a cessation of military actions and the establishment of an armistice.

Fillipov [Stalin]The commander of the troops of the enemy, Ridgway, today made a statement with a proposal that representatives of both warring sides meet on a Danish ship in the port of Wonsan for a meeting about the cessation of military activities. Simultaneously with this he stated that a corresponding guarantee is required, and only in this case can military actions be ceased.I report to you my opinion on the given question.I ask you to study [it] and give an answer, and I also ask you to communicate it immediately to Comrade Kim Il Sung.1.

As concerns the place for holding the negotiations, Ridgway suggests the port of Wonsan.Considering that Wonsan is a fortified sea base of North Korea and the enemy intends to make a landing there, it seems to me disadvantageous to agree to hold negotiations in Wonsan. Is it impossible to propose for the conduct of negotiations the town of Gaeseong [Kaesong], a point on the 38th parallel?3.

I have received your two telegrams (of 24.6.51 and 28.6.51). I fully agree with your opinion.a) As regards the time periods for the delivery of armaments for sixteen divisions, we should act only on the basis of the productive and transport possibilities of the Soviet Union, that is [we should] complete the deliveries of arms for sixteen divisions in the course of three years, and in 1951 complete the deliveries for ten divisions.b) The staff-organizational structure you have proposed for the present Chinese infantry divisions is very good. We are implementing it. With sixteen divisions armed in accordance with this staff-organizational structure, the Chinese army will be far stronger than at present.2.

At the end of the text is stated: “Only two representatives must participate from each side. Moreover these representatives must be from the command of the corresponding military units, and not representatives of the governments.Thus, from the Chinese side a representative of the volunteer troops must participate and not a representative of China, as a warring state.” I consider this completely correct.I have received a telegram from Comrade Kim Il Sung in which he asks how he should answer if Ridgway calls for negotiations to begin.I have already communicated to Comrade Kim Il Sung and Peng Dehuai that on the one hand we must carefully watch the military situation so as not to give the enemy the possibility of using this moment to his advantage, and on the other hand Comrade Kim Il Sung and Peng Dehuai must discuss this question and be prepared, in case of a demand by the enemy to begin negotiations, to send corresponding representatives to conduct negotiations.As regards how to answer Ridgway, after receiving a demand from Ridgway, the contents should be discussed and an answer formulated.

""Both sides must simultaneously issue an order for a ceasefire. Land, sea and air forces of both sides, after the issuing of the order on a ceasefire, must within all the borders of Korea cease fire and halt all other hostile actions.""This point will possibly be accepted by the enemy without qualifications.2. ""Land, sea and air forces of both sides must withdraw from the 38th parallel for a distance of 10 English miles and create a buffer zone in the region 10 English miles to the south and to the north of the 38th parallel. The civil administration of the buffer zone must be as it was before 25.6.1950, in other words to the north of the 38th parallel under the jurisdiction of the Korean People's government and to the south of the 38th parallel under the jurisdiction of the South-Korean government.""It is possible that there will be some divergences [from this proposal] among the enemy but we consider that our proposal is extremely just and it will be difficult for the enemy to refute it.3. ""Both sides must cease the transport of arms, troops and reinforcements (including land, sea and air transport) into Korea from outside the country and also the aforementioned transports to the front line on the territory of Korea.""We think that the enemy for his part will also advance a proposal on this question, and we therefore intend to take the initiative in this. But perhaps it is better to leave off the last part of our proposal?4. ""To create a control committee of neutral states which would supervise the fulfillment of points 1, 2 and 3. In this committee there must be an equal number of representatives of neutral states that have not taken part in the Korean war and that have been selected by both sides.""We think that the enemy also will advance an analogous proposal, therefore we intend to show initiative in this. However, there will be numerous difficulties in the fulfillment of this point.""Members"" of the control committee proposed by the enemy will monitor our military transport on the Chinese-Korean border and at important communications points in Korea. Or should we not take the initiative ourselves, but wait for the enemy to advance his proposal, after which we will accept it?I ask you to communicate your opinion about how to proceed expediently. To completely refuse to create a control committee seems also inadvisable. 5. ""Both sides must carry out repatriation of prisoners of war. In the course of four months after the cessation of military operations to conduct a full mutual exchange of them, in separate batches.""The enemy will possibly propose to conduct a one for one exchange. We must demand repatriation of all prisoners of war. However, the enemy has taken prisoner a relatively larger number of North Koreans, who have already been included in the ranks of the South Korean troops, and therefore this situation will possibly elicit an argument.In our opinion the 5 basic points indicated above must be accepted at the meeting of military representatives of both sides.In addition there are some other points:1. ""All foreign troops including Chinese volunteer troops must completely leave North and South Korea within a specified period of time (for example within three-four months), in separate batches.This is also a very important point. However, the representatives of the enemy possibly will think that this question belongs among political questions and should not be resolved at this meeting.I ask you to study and communicate whether our side should advance this point.2. ""Within a specified period of time (for example in several months) refugees of North and South Korea must be returned to the areas where they lived previously.""Comrade KIM IL SUNG insists on advancing this point. However, to bring this about is very difficult. It is apparent that with regard to this question many differences of opinion and many arguments will arise between the representatives of North and South Korea, which can have an influence on the resolution of other important questions.Or is it possible to advance this proposal?If it leads to arguments and is not resolved, then transfer it for discussion at an international conference of a political character.I ask you to communicate your opinion on the points indicated above.

I received your telegram of 11 August 7:00.2. At the evening meeting the mistaken views of the enemy became even more intensified. The enemy considers that it is possible through pressure to force us to abandon discussion of the question of the 38th parallel. He has already four times expressed his wish to discuss a proposal about a military demarcation line and a buffer zone on the basis of the present line of the front and the present military situation.We consider that the goal of this is to avoid defeat in the area of propaganda but also secretly to show that he can alter his proposal. Taking this into account, in our statement in today's meeting we pursued the goal of striking a blow against his unfounded theory of refusal to discuss the question of the 38th parallel, and also tried to ascertain if he intended to abandon his unfounded proposal.At today's meeting the enemy displayed some interest in the portion of our statement where we tried to ascertain his intention. However, in his statement in the second half of the day the representative of the enemy expressed a strong [sense of] injustice and tried to lay on us the responsibility for the impasse that has been created in the negotiations.Our statement for tomorrow will be constructed on the basis of your instructions. The goal of the statement will be to smash this [claim of] injustice of the enemy, to unmask his capacity for deception and simultaneously to advance such questions as to force the enemy more clearly to express his position.The main goal of the statement is once again to underscore that if the enemy does not renounce his unfounded proposal, there will be no progress in the work of the conference. We consider that we can also express our wish to change the proposal about the buffer zone in the area of the 38th parallel as the military demarcation line only in such case as the enemy clearly gives us to understand that he abandons his earlier proposal.3. After the resumption of the work of the conference, the mistaken views of the enemy have become even more intensified and the enemy has become even more convinced that we yearn for peace, and therefore it is possible to get concessions from us. All this was possible to foresee.However, from the entire course of the conference and the general situation outside the conference it is apparent that it is not possible to force the enemy to accept the proposal about the 38th parallel. In the course of several days the enemy on the one hand will put pressure on us and try to force us to be the first to make a concession, and on the other hand will prepare for a possible breakdown in the conference.Therefore we consider it necessary to work out a definite resolution with regard to the 38th parallel.If our final goal consists of conducting a struggle for the principle of the determination of the 38th parallel as the military demarcation line and if in this regard we can admit only certain alterations, then we should have in mind a breakdown in the negotiations and we must prepare for this.In the opposite case we should have some kind of compromise position determined. Our past proposal, it is true, could not foresee the possible development of the present situation, but it is also not possible to win much time through action in accordance with your orders contained in the telegram of 17.7.51 about a concession to the enemy for the purpose of gaining time,4. We (Li Kenong, Deng Hua, Xie Fang and Qiao Guanua) suggest that the final goal of the enemy is to cease military operations at the present front line. In relation to this the enemy may allow small alterations.It is thus necessary for us to decide: to struggle for the 38th parallel and prepare for an end to the negotiations or, avoiding a breakdown in the negotiations, to carry on the struggle for the cessation of military operations and to study the question of the cessation of military operations at the present front line.Having studied, on the basis of the limited materials we have, the general world situation, the needs of our state and the fact that at present Korea cannot continue the war, we think that it is better to think over the question of cessation of military operations at the present front line than to carry on the struggle for the 38th parallel and bring the conference to a breakdown.In connection with this it is necessary to take into consideration that it is possible to gain some concessions from the enemy in the discussion of the proposal about cessation of military operations at the present front line.Thus it will be possible to secure 3-5 years time for preparation of forces.Of course, if the enemy does not in any way abandon his unfounded proposal, which he is at present insisting on, then we also intend to choose only the path of a schism.Having limited materials at our disposal, the situation has been studied superficially.

After an investigation by representatives of both sides, the enemy in justifying himself stated that this was [committed by] partisans from the South Korean partisan detachment active in our region, and therefore he does not take any responsibility for this.After this, on the night of August 22, one enemy plane dropped nine bombs on the territory of the neutral zone in Kaesong and fired on the house where our delegation is quartered. Although American officers came to investigate that same night, the enemy impudently refused to acknowledge their actions and contended that the fragments and craters found there are not from air force bombs. After this, the enemy, contradicting the former, said that the raid was made by an unidentified plane.The enemy dared to make these impudent provocations because he considered that our side would not make a breakdown in the negotiations over this. He therefore wanted to use this measure to put pressure on us.Of course, it is possible [that it was] a South Korean secret service plan to break up the negotiations, but the possibility is excluded that Syngmann Rhee could send a plane to make an attack on Kaesong in the region of the building where the negotiations are being conducted on his own initiative, without agreement from the Americans. Therefore, the provocative acts of the enemy have caused us to make a decisive counter-strike.We have declared a temporary cessation of the negotiations until the enemy accepts responsibility for what has happened. The negotiations will not be resumed until we receive a satisfactory answer—we'll let them cool their heels. However, we do not want to take the initiative in declaring a breakdown in the negotiations.We suppose that the enemy will not openly acknowledge his provocative acts.The dragging out of the negotiations can end in two ways.First, the delay may bring the negotiations to a breakdown.We are forcefully preparing ourselves to resist a possible attack by enemy troops directly at the front. We are simultaneously strictly defending the ports on the western and eastern coast of North Korea from landings by the enemy. For the last several days enemy planes have passed through the area of the following cities on the China coast: Qingdao, Shanghai, Hangzhou. This was also done for provocative purposes.Simultaneously with this, the enemy wanted to reconnoiter the air defense of our coastal regions. With regard to this, we want to strengthen our command in Korea and the air defense of the cities located in the coastal region. In a subsequent telegram I will communicate to you a draft [plan] for sending Soviet military advisers to work with the Chinese volunteer troops in Korea.Simultaneously with this I will ask you about an additional delivery of artillery armaments.Second, it is possible that as a result of the delay in the negotiations the enemy will find the means to extricate [himself] from the impasse and an agreement will be reached on the question of a military demarcation line.At the present time we want to use the period of the break in negotiations for conducting a cold war in order to expose the impudent provocative acts of the enemy. However, we suppose that the enemy will not openly acknowledge his provocations.If after some period of time the situation will develop so that the enemy wishes to renew the negotiations, then we think that at our own initiative we can propose a way which would lead to a turn in the negotiations and to force the enemy to agree with this.Comrade Kim Il Sung suggests for the purpose of securing the neutral zone at Kaeseong to ask representatives of neutral states to participate at the conference as monitors and witnesses for the period of negotiations, as a necessary condition for the resumption of the negotiations. Moreover, these representatives can be used in the future as a control organ for the implementation of the ceasefire.How do you view this? Do you consider this necessary or do you have a better way? I ask your orders on the above.With greetings.Mao Zedong.[...]","['Mao, Zedong, 1893-1976']","['Communist countries--Internal relations', 'Korean War, 1950-1953', 'Anti-Americanism', 'Korean War, 1950-1953--Armistices', 'Korean War, 1950-1953--Soviet Union', 'China--Foreign relations--United States', 'Korean War, 1950-1953--China', 'Korean War, 1950-1953--United States']"

Filippov [Stalin]",19511114,"SECOND MAIN ADMINISTRATION OF THE GENERAL STAFF OF THE SOVIET ARMYCIPHERED TELEGRAM No. 25902Copies: Stalin (2)From BEIJING Received 13:40 14.11.1951SERIES ""G"" T.To Comrade FILIPPOV [Stalin]Comrade FILIPPOV!After the resumption of negotiations for cessation of military operations in Korea, in view of the large losses at the front over the last two months and the increase in demands within America and outside its borders for cessation of military operations, the possibility of the American side accepting the conditions for an armistice has increased. However, at the same time, taking into account internal and external politics, the American government is still trying to keep the international situation tense, and therefore the Americans, while actively engaged in spying and carrying out a policy of an advance in the course of the negotiations, are trying to drag out the negotiations.The main question in the negotiations is the determination of the demarcation line. In place of the demand for designation of the demarcation line deep in the rear of our troops, the enemy has proposed to designate it on the basis of the present line of the front, with some alterations and with the inclusion of the region of Kaesong in the buffer zone.At present the enemy is already demanding the designation of the line in fact contiguous with the line of the troops at the time of the signing of an agreement on cessation of military operations as the demarcation line without the inclusion of the region of Kaesong in the buffer zone. We are insisting on the cessation of military operations at the present front line and the designation of the present line contiguous to the troops of both sides as the demarcation line with the introduction of alterations in the line contiguous to troops of both sides in case of alterations of it in the period of the achievement of an agreement on all points of the agenda. At the present time the enemy is fighting with us precisely on this question, but we assume that this fight will not continue for long.Our proposal about cessation of military operations at the present front line and our agreement to set aside the question of the 38th parallel as the demarcation line, and the question of the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea before the convening of a political conference, was made not only because the present negotiations are negotiations about cessation of military operations and [because] the enemy will not in any case want to exchange eastern mountainous regions to the north of the 38th parallel for low-lying regions to the south of the 38th parallel, but also because in case the enemy refuses to leave the eastern mountainous regions we also have mountainous regions there [that are] advantageous for defense; as regards the western coastal plain to the south of the 38th parallel, it is advantageous for us because it has a much greater population than the eastern regions, and furthermore it is rich in agricultural products, plus the region of Kaesong is an advanced post for taking Seoul.Comrade Kim Il Sung during the discussion of armistice conditions in Beijing in June of this year had the same opinion on this question. This time it also was done with his agreement.As regards the discussion of the question of monitoring at the negotiations, we earlier suggested to propose to create an organ for cessation of military operations, in which would be included representatives of both sides, and to assign to it the task of monitoring the fulfillment of the conditions of the cessation of military operations and monitoring in the buffer zone.However, the enemy is sure to demand the establishment of monitoring in the rear of both sides, in order to limit the transport by both sides of reinforcements and military goods.We intend to agree to the establishment of monitoring at 1 or 2 border points of both sides and in accordance with your instructions to propose to transfer the monitoring functions to neutral states, in other words to states that are not participating in the war. We want to invite three states to fulfill these tasks: the Soviet Union, Poland and India.It is possible that the Americans will oppose this at the beginning. Then we will propose to introduce [as monitors] representatives from Sweden and one state of Latin America.As regards the exchange of prisoners of war, we will oppose exchange according to the principle of 1 for 1 and will propose exchange according to the principle of return of all prisoners of war by both sides.I think it will not be difficult to reach agreement on this question.On the question of the governments of the interested states convening a conference of high level officials, three variants are possible:1. Convening a conference of political representatives of both sides which are presently conducting negotiations. (It is possible that America will propose this variant.)2. Convening a conference with the participation of four states: the Soviet Union, China, America, England and representatives of North and South Korea.3. Convening a conference with participation of seven states: the Soviet Union, China, America, England, France, India, Egypt and representatives of North and South Korea.I ask you, proceeding from the international situation, to give instructions regarding which of the three variants is best or propose a new variant.At the present time, on the basis of the aforementioned we will achieve cessation of military operations this year. At the same time, we will carry out the necessary preparation in case of a dragging out of the negotiations by the enemy and their breakdown. Expecting that the negotiations will be drawn out for another half year or year, we have moved toward economizing on our human and material forces in the Korean theater of military operations and we are pursuing the tactics of a long, active defense, with the goal of holding the position we presently occupy and inflicting great manpower losses on the enemy, in order to gain victory in the war.Within the country we are preparing for the reorganization of the army, reduction of the bureaucracy, introduction of a regime of economizing, increasing production and further strengthening of the campaign to aid Korea and struggle against American imperialism, for the purpose of ensuring the further conduct of the war in Korea, securing also by financial means the stabilization of the scene within the country, and also strengthening state construction and mainly construction of defense.In the present year, in light of rendering aid to Korea and the struggle against American imperialism, the budget of the Chinese state in comparison with 1950 has increased by 60%. 32% of the total budget is directly being used in the Korean theater of military operations. (Military credit extended to us by the Soviet Government is not included in this calculation.)Thus, if a regime of economizing is not introduced now, in the next year the budget will increase even more, which inevitably will have an influence on finances and lead to a great rise in the prices of goods, which in turn will create difficulties at the front, and also in the area of construction in the rear. It is true that achieving peace as a result of the negotiations is advantageous for us, but we also are not afraid of dragging out the negotiations. Acting thus, we will surely be able to achieve victory. At the same time we will be able successfully to carry out various measures within the country and secure stabilization and further development in the area of politics and the economy.I ask your instructions on the above.MAO ZEDONGNo. 563114.11.51[...]","['Mao, Zedong, 1893-1976']","['38th Parallel', 'Korea (North)--Armed Forces', 'Korean War, 1950-1953', 'Korean War, 1950-1953--Armistices', 'Korea (North)--Foreign relations--Soviet Union', 'China--Foreign relations--Korea (North)', 'Soviet Union--Foreign policy', 'Prisoners of war', 'China--Foreign relations--Soviet Union']"

Moreover, after receipt of our inquiry (our No. 1059), on the question of the indicated demands of the Korean friends you limited yourself only to a report that you had raised the question at your own initiative and to a repetition of the question of whether there is a discrepancy between the proposals of Comrade Vyshinsky about withdrawal of troops from the 38th parallel and agreement in Kaeseong to the point of the agenda about the establishment of a demarcation line. Concerning the appeal, you also only reported that it would be announced 19 November.Thus, both in telegram No. 1353 of 19 November and in telegram No. 1355 of 19 November, you informed us that the Korean friends will announce their appeal, even though at that time you did not have instructions from us and could not yet have received an answer to your inquiry. As a result the Korean friends made the appeal without agreement with us.In that way you acted inadmissably thoughtlessly. Your guilt is aggravated also by the fact that you did not even take the trouble to find out from the Korean friends whether they had reached agreement with the Chinese friends about the appeal to the UN with the aforementioned demands, and you elucidated this only when you had received a direct order to do so and after the Koreans had already made their statement.Learn this in the future.","['Gromyko, Andrei Andreevich, 1909-1989']","['Korean War, 1950-1953', 'Razuvaev, V.

As a consequence of this, the negotiations cannot be dragged out for a long time. Nevertheless, the enemy is trying to drag out the negotiations under the pretext of a rash demand about limiting the rebuilding and construction of airports after the cessation of military operations and also a demand about liberation of prisoners on a voluntary basis. However, in view of the fact that our side decisively opposes these proposals and also in view of the fact that it is very difficult for the enemy to mobilize public opinion for continuation of the war in Korea, the satellites of the enemy and the USA itself are trying to bring an end to the war in Korea, therefore in recent days the enemy was forced to set aside the discussion of the question of limiting restoration and construction of airports in Korea and moved to discussion of small questions concerning the agreement.According to the concrete conditions of the text of the agreement on an armistice proposed by the enemy, it is obvious that, as before, this text is not final, in other words that, as before, the enemy has included conditions about limiting the restoration and construction of airports and about liberation of prisoners of war on a voluntary basis, after having declared that these conditions can be omitted and it is possible not to discuss them. From this it is obvious that the possibility of reaching a final agreement is increasing. Of course, we never have and are not now counting only on these possibilities.We simultaneously will vigilantly follow the tricks of the ruling circles of the USA who in view of the growth of internal and external opposition will carry out as before a policy of prolonging and even of breaking down the negotiations in order to strain the international situation even more. However we are prepared in military and in political relations to inflict decisive blows on the enemy in order to shatter its plans. At the present time both sides in the negotiations have already moved over to detailed discussion of the questions.For the purposes of achieving a final agreement on an armistice it is necessary to receive your concrete instructions on the following questions:1. About the monitoring organ composed of representatives of neutral states.The American side proposes that both sides each invite three states whose armed forces are not participating in the military operations in Korea, and also that each invited state name one senior officer as a representative (in all 6 persons from the neutral states of both sides) for the creation of a monitoring organ of neutral states.We intend to agree with this arrangement and ask the Soviet Union, Poland and Czechoslovakia to send representatives so that they could discuss the matter on an equal basis with representatives of the three states invited by the USA and also have the right to veto.2. Each of the abovementioned neutral states must name one deputy representative who could participate in the meetings of the monitoring organ in the name of its representative. All representatives can take with them assistants-advisers from among the citizens of their country. All invited neutral states will provide the necessary number of administrative workers for the creation of a secretariat responsible for keeping protocols, transmitting documents and translations.3. The functions of the monitoring organ of neutral states are:a) Practical control and monitoring of the observation of the agreement by both sides--not to transport to Korea from abroad, through mutually agreed upon points, shipments to the rear as reinforcements, military personnel, combat aircraft, armored vehicles, tanks, arms and ammunition after the armistice agreement is signed and goes into force, and also to carry out an exchange of military personnel of both sides on the scale stipulated by the agreement and in identical numbers;b) Report about places where an incident occurs, about the guilt of anyone from the [two] sides outside the demilitarization zone who violates the agreement on armistice, and also the carrying out of practical observation.At the request of both sides or one side of the commission on military armistice, the monitoring organ must immediately send a neutral group for inspection and observation and also for bringing the results of the investigation to the commission on military armistice.4. Simultaneously with the establishment of the functions indicated in column ""A"" point 3, the American side also proposes that both sides after cessation of military operations must present information about precise places of deployment of the land, sea and air units which are participating in the military operations in Korea, and also must not change the deployment or carry out a concentration of their troops. We intend not to agree with this, since it was not stipulated in the points on which agreement was reached.5. As concerns the points of disembarkation in the rear where observation must be established, the American side proposes to establish in South Korea Seoul, Chemulpo [Inchon], Dzioio, Gensiu, Tsiusiu, Taiden, Anto, Dzensiu, Gunzan, Taiko, Dzenten, Pusan--in all 12 points. In North Korea to establish Singisiu, Manpkhodin, Kangge, Khesandun, Khekido, Sengdzii, Kaisiu--in all 15 points.At each point a region of operation for the neutral state must be established within a radius of 30 miles from the center of the point.We consider that the enemy has proposed too many points, the area of operation is too broad, and the number of open points is not equal. We intend to agree that both sides open 3-5 points each in North Korea: Singisiu, Seisin, Khanko, Manpkhodin and one airport. In South Korea: Pusan, Chemulpo, Suigei, Reisui, Khokodo. We also intend to propose that the radius of operations of the neutral group be established as 5 kilometers from the center of the point.6. Neutral groups of observers will be attached to the monitoring organ of neutral states. The group must be organized as a minimum from four mid-level officers (lieutenant-major), two officers each from the representatives of neutral states invited by each side. In case of necessity subgroups can be created attached to the monitor groups, composed of two representatives, one person from each side.The American side proposes to create 40 neutral groups of observers. We consider that this is too many. If an agreement is reached that both sides will each open 5 of their rear points, then it will be sufficient for fulfilling the obligations of the monitoring organ to have 16 neutral groups of observers, of which 10 groups will be permanently located at mutually agreed upon points of disembarkation and 6 groups can be used as reserves to send to the site of incidents.7. The monitoring organ of neutral groups and the commission on the military armistice must be located in one place. The neutral groups of observation during the fulfillment of the tasks of inspection and observation do not have the right to study the ""construction and characteristics"" of all types of arms and ammunition.As concerns the reports about results of the work of the neutral groups of observation, we consider that official reports must be adopted by the majority of the members of the given group, but reports not adopted by the majority of members or reports from individual persons cannot be official documents. They can be used as reference materials.8. Material supply of the monitoring organ of neutral states and the groups subordinate to it must be provided by both warring sides. Both sides must provide the monitoring organ with transport for trips of its members to points and to places where a violation of the agreement on armistice occurs.All the 8 points set forth above concern questions of monitoring by neutral states in the rear regions of both sides outside the demilitarized zone.I ask you to review whether our point of view is correct and whether anything needs to be added.If you agree with our opinions, then do you consider it necessary to communicate about this in advance to the comrade leaders of the parties of Poland and Czechoslovakia[?]I ask you to give your answer.Note: The texts of the agreement reached on two agendas was sent to you by separate telegram.With greetings.MAO ZEDONGNo. 32631.1.52[...]","['Mao, Zedong, 1893-1976']","['38th Parallel', 'Korea (North)--Armed Forces', 'Korean War, 1950-1953--Armistices', 'Korea (North)--Foreign relations--Soviet Union', 'China--Foreign relations--Korea (North)', 'Prisoners of war', 'China--Foreign relations--Soviet Union']"

In a conversation he said that the Korean people throughout the country demand peace and do not want to continue the war.If the Soviet Union and China consider it advantageous to continue the war, then the Central Committee of the Workers' Party will be able to overcome any difficulties and hold to their position.I answered that a peaceful settlement on the basis of justice and rationality is advantageous for us. I also explained to him about the favorable conditions of our side in the present military situation and about the increase in the difficulties of America. Therefore an agreement on an armistice can be reached. However in military relations we will carry out active preparation of our forces for further conduct of military operations.While departing, Minister Pak Heon-yeong agreed with my point of view about the general situation and said that his visit had the goal of a simple meeting and his opinion is not the opinion of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party and the Korean government, but purely his personal opinion.2. In 1951 the Korean government collected agricultural taxes in kind in grain in the amount of 650,000 tons, which constituted too large a percentage of the entire yield. At the present time 10 percent of the population is suffering from hunger. The majority of the peasant population will be able to subsist only until April-May.If there is no assistance soon, then this will influence not only the carrying out of spring sowing but also the gathering of the harvest.They say that our government has already resolved to deliver to the Korean government 30,000 tons of grain. I do not know, is this true? If it is not true, I consider that it is necessary to prepare for timely delivery of 30,000 tons of grain in March for the purpose of providing assistance so that the peasants can engage in spring planting.3. I consider that although our budget is also very strained, in 1952 we nevertheless need to plan to apportion 1,600,000 million yuan (which constitutes approximately 237 million rubles) according to the plan of 1951 budget year for rendering aid to Korea. This amount can hardly be reduced. I ask that all this possibly be planned earlier in the general budget.""My answer of 4.2 of this year.""I received your telegram of 22.1 of this year. As concerns rendering aid to Korea, in our budget for 1952 we have already included expenditures of 1,500,000 million yuan (approximately equal to 222 million rubles), which somewhat exceeds the sum of the trade credit extended by China to Korea in 1951, the sum granted by China for urgent restoration of Korean railroads and also the sum granted by China for maintenance of Korean citizens located in Manchuria.If military operations in Korea are ended, then it is assumed that expenditures for aid to Korea will be increased.At the end of January of this year the Minister of Trade of Korea Comrade Jang Si-woo [Jang Si U] came to Beijing for negotiations about deliveries of goods in 1952. As a result of these negotiations the total value we established for goods delivered by us comes to 700,000 million yuan (approximately 103 million rubles).Korea will not deliver anything to us in exchange, and therefore the aforementioned amount was established as the sum of trade credit.As concerns foodstuffs stipulated in the application, the delivery according to this application will be carried out from February to May. In each month 5,000 tons of rice and 5,000 tons of foxtail millet [Setaria italica] (in all 40,000 tons of rice and foxtail millet will be delivered), in each month 200 tons of bean oil.In addition, in February 3,300,000 meters of cotton fabric will be delivered.Negotiations will be concluded soon. According to your practical observation, if military operations in Korea cease, what is necessary to restore in Korea as first priority?The army of the Chinese volunteers can render assistance as a work force to restore the highways and agricultural economy. What other kind of aid is needed from us?I ask you to study these questions and communicate your opinion.""MAO ZEDONGNo. 4318.2.52[…] ","['Mao, Zedong, 1893-1976']","['Korea (North)--Armed Forces', 'Korean War, 1950-1953--Armistices', 'China--Foreign relations--Korea (North)', 'China--Foreign relations--Soviet Union', 'China--Foreign economic relations--Korea (North)', 'Korean War, 1950-1953--China', 'Agriculture--Korea (North)', 'Food supply--Korea (North)']"

We share the opinion of Comrade MAO ZEDONG on this question.However, in order to spare the DPRK and its people suffering and unjustified, needless losses, it is necessary for us hopefully to provide cover for the most important sites and to go over to active operations.For this it would be desirable:1. To strengthen antiaircraft defense. By our accounting, for this it is necessary to receive additional arms for ten antiaircraft regiments (including three middle caliber regiments and seven small caliber regiments).It is desirable in connection with this that the Chinese comrades put out half and that the KPA receive arms for five antiartillery regiments directly from you.2. To activate the night operations of the VVS [Air Force] of the KPA [Korean People's Army] and CPV [Chinese People's Volunteers]. It is necessary to cover North Korea in the daytime with fighter aviation, if only up to the line of Pyongyang.VVS of the KPA is prepared at any time to begin active military operations. Along with this, in the near future 40 crews of KPA TU-2 pilots will finish their training in the Soviet Union. We would like for these pilots to come to the DPRK together with TU-2 airplanes so that they could immediately take part in active military operations and bring influence to bear on important enemy sites.3. To carry out a number of ground operations, appreciable to the enemy, so as to divert the operations of the enemy VVS from our rear and to influence the course of the negotiations in Kaeseong.Aside from all of this, to raise the battle capability of the KPA it is extremely necessary for us to receive from you in the nearest future technical goods and materials according to our note of January 10, 1952 and July 9, 1952 and application for 1952 in the note of October 6, 1951, within the limits of your possibilities.4. In Kaeseong we need simultaneously to move decisively toward the soonest conclusion of an armistice, a ceasefire and transfer of all prisoners of war on the basis of the Geneva convention. These demands are supported by all peace loving peoples and will lead us out of a passive position in Kaeseong.The change in the character of military operations on the ground and in the air will have a corresponding, desirable influence on the enemy.A telegram of analogous content was sent to comrade MAO ZEDONG.The Korean people are boundlessly grateful to you for the enormous selfless assistance being rendered to the Korean People's Democratic Republic.We await your orders and advice on the aforementioned questions.We wish you good health and long years of life for the well-being and happiness of progressive humanity.With deep respect and esteemYour Kim Il SungPyongyang 16.7.52.”","['Razuvaev, Vladimir Nikolaevich, 1900-1980', 'Soviet Union.

After a two-day study by us of the given questions our comrades unanimously consider that at present, when the enemy is subjecting us to furious bombardment, accepting a provocative and fraudulent proposal from the enemy, which does not signify in fact any kind of concession, is highly disadvantageous for us.We will look at the positive and negative sides of this question:Rejecting the proposal of the enemy will bring only one harmful consequence—further losses for the Korean people and Chinese people's volunteers. However, once the war began, China began to help Korea, the Korean people already honestly stood on the front line of defense of the camp of peace of the whole world.At the cost of the sacrifices of the Korean people a strengthening of the position at the 38th parallel has been won, North Korea and Northeast China have been defended.The people of Korea and China, especially their armed forces, have received the possibility of being tempered and acquiring experience in the struggle against American imperialism.In addition, in the course of the struggle of the Korean and Chinese peoples, their might has been strengthened, which is inspiring the peace-loving peoples of the whole world in the struggle against aggressive war and is facilitating the development of the movement for defense of peace throughout the world. This also limits the mobility of the main forces of American imperialism and makes it suffer constant losses in the east. As the stronghold of peace throughout the world—the Soviet Union can strengthen its reconstruction and can exercise its influence on the development of the revolutionary movement of peoples of all countries. This will mean the delay of a new world war.The presence of these great movements testifies to the fact that the Korean people are no longer alone.In the first place, the Chinese people want to apply all their strength to overcome the difficulties of the Korean people. Therefore at the present time we ask you not to be ashamed to appeal to us with questions which demand an urgent resolution of the situation in Korea.If we are not able to resolve your questions, then we will together with you appeal to FILIPPOV with a request to render assistance for the resolution of these questions. As concerns the acceptance of the proposal of the enemy, that will bring great harm.In the first place, accepting a provocative and fraudulent proposal from the enemy under the influence of its bombardment will place us in a disadvantageous position in political and military relations. The enemy will surely use this weakness of ours for further pressure on us, which will lead to new provocations from the side of the enemy. Then, being in a disadvantageous position, upon putting pressure on the enemy we possibly will suffer even greater failures and the aforementioned positive sides will lose their significance. This will signify an unsuccessful course, because of which the whole game will be lost.Therefore to accept the proposals of the enemy in the present situation will inevitably make the enemy even more ambitious and undermine our prestige.If we display resolution not to accept the enemy's proposal and to prepare ourselves for a breakdown in the negotiations from the side of the enemy, the enemy surely will not cause a breakdown in the negotiations.In the process of a further delay of the negotiations, upon decisive insistence by our side on our point of view, it is possible that the enemy will make a new concession.If the enemy will not concede or breaks off the negotiations, then we must continue military operations so as to find in the course of the war, which the enemy cannot resolve, a means for changing the present situation.We will report to Comrade FILIPPOV about this proposal and the course taken by us and we will ascertain his opinion.We will report to you the results upon receiving an answer from him.With greetings! MAO ZEDONG, 3:00, 15.7.52”——————————————“To Comrade MAO ZEDONG!Your telegram of 3:00 15 July of this year was received.As a result of careful study and discussion of it, we have arrived at a unanimous conclusion. We consider that your analysis concerning the present situation is correct. At the same time, considering our present position, you have communicated to us to that we henceforth not be ashamed to raise questions about the assistance we need, for which we are sincerely grateful to you. We consider it necessary to activate military operations in the long struggle against the enemy. If we do not show aggressiveness in military operations and continue a passive defense, the enemy will not take into consideration our forces, and will continue furious bombardment for the purpose of putting military pressure on us.We therefore propose to implement the following urgent measures:1. It is necessary to strengthen antiaircraft artillery, by at least 10 regiments. It is necessary to strengthen PVO [Anti-aircraft Defense] of the city of Pyongyang and all important industrial sites, for example: Shuifens-kaya [Supung or Shuifeng], Chandzinganskaya, and Puchenganskaya [Bukcheng] electrical stations. 2. It is necessary to make the air battles of our VVS [Air Force] more active: a) To improve the command of the VVS so that it correctly directs the air battles on Korean territory.b) The diameter of operations of aviation units must not be limited only to the present line along the Yalu river. At the least, it is necessary to extend it to the border of Pyongyang and to strengthen by all measures the PVO of the capital and important industrial sites.c) It is necessary to send already trained air force bomber units on night actions deep in enemy [territory], to boldly carry out air battles, subjecting to bombardment a number of airports, warehouses, barracks and other military installations of the enemy.3. In infantry operations it is necessary to make local attacks on several parts of the front in order to put military pressure on the enemy.I ask you to review the opinions indicated above and to make a decision about rendering us assistance.With highest respect toward you.

Moreover, in their first speech the Korean delegation should present the plans to reunify Korea by peaceful means, withdraw all foreign troops, and oblige major countries (who are directly involved in the war) to ensure and help to bring about Korea's peaceful reunification. China and the Soviet Union should, in turn, express their support for the Korean delegation's positions one day after they speak. Therefore, I should also make a comprehensive statement myself. Right now I am reorganizing the drafts of the opening speech and two statements supporting the Korean delegation, and making changes based on several suggestions from the Soviet comrades. We will also present the principles for an Asian peace charter. However, we will not emphasize the Indochina issue for the moment since we hope to concentrate on the Korean issue in the first discussion. It will also demonstrate that we are not the people who are eager to negotiate. (2) Regarding the issue of the chairman of the conference, we have already consulted with the Soviet Union and Britain in advance and decided that Thailand, the Soviet Union, and Britain should take the chair in turn. Thailand already acted as the interim chair when this afternoon's meeting started at 3:00 p.m. Afterwards, the United States proposed that the above three countries take turns as chair. It was instantly put to vote and adopted. The meeting was adjourned thereafter. This meeting took only 15 minutes. Speeches and discussion will start tomorrow.

141,"Cable from Zhou Enlai, 'Regarding a Meeting with British Foreign Secretary Eden'",19540501,"Chairman [Mao Zedong], Comrade [Liu] Shaoqi, and the Central Committee: Comrade Molotov invited me to meet with Eden yesterday afternoon, and we discussed the following questions: (1) The Korean issue. There is no meeting today on 1 May, and the conference will reopen on 3 May. Only the Turkish and Thai delegations made speeches yesterday morning. The meeting was adjourned in less than thirty minutes. Eden suggested holding a restricted session and said that “[the members should be] the five of us plus North and South Korea.” Eden said that he had already talked to [US Secretary of State John Foster] Dulles about this, and he assumed that [French Foreign Minister Georges] Bidault would not oppose it either. Molotov and I both agreed to hold the restricted session. We also asked what subjects would be specifically discussed in the restricted session. However, Eden did not answer this question. It is the British and Americans who are taking the initiative and sounding us out, and we should not react too positively except to agree to hold the meeting. Based on the general situation, I assume that Eden's proposal for a restricted session is related to Dulles' return to the US next week. Until now, no North Atlantic [Treaty Organization] country except Turkey has spoken yet to support Dulles during the discussion of the Korean issue. Although the United States fired many blanks on the Indochina issue, they could not scare anyone but themselves. The United States is attempting to form an alliance of invaders of Southeast Asia. However, Britain is still hesitating. On the other hand, France's request for more air support is being refused by Britain and the United States. In sum, it is now impossible for the United States to stop negotiations on the Indochina issue. Eisenhower's recent words showed his retreat and embarrassed Dulles. Therefore Dulles decided to run away [from the conference] and leave the problems to the Under Secretary of State, [General Walter Bedell] Smith. Eden said that Dulles had already decided to return to the US next week. Molotov responded that “it will increase the responsibilities of the four of us.” The current situation shows that Eden will stay, and so will Bidault since [French Secretary of State for Relations with the Associated States Marc] Jacquet of the de Gaulle group and [French Foreign Ministry Political and Economic Affairs Assistant Director Roland Jacquin de] Margerie, who insists on the ending of the Indochina war, came to Geneva from France to pressure him. However, it is still not clear whether or not an agreement on the Korean issue can be reached.(2) The Indochina issue. Eden said that “I will not use this as a condition for the issue of membership [of countries which should be invited to join the discussion], nor do I require you to answer me. I just want to ask if the Soviet and Chinese sides can push for the withdrawal of the wounded from Dien Bien Phu.” Molotov said: “It can be solved if you discuss this with the Vietnamese delegation.” I said: “It is better to have the two belligerent parties discuss this directly. The two belligerent parties in the Korean War used to discuss directly the issue of exchanging wounded and sick POWs before the armistice in Korea.” Regarding the issue of membership, I said: “Five countries have already been invited to join the discussions on the Indochina issue. It is odd that the decision on the invitation of related countries on both sides has not yet been made. Obviously someone is preventing both sides from attending the negotiations.” Eden said: “I am not preventing it.” It seems that it will take another two days to solve the problem of membership.(3) The issue of Sino-British relations. When Molotov mentioned that China was complaining about unfairness in international affairs, Eden said: “Britain does recognize China. However, China does not recognize us.” I said: “It is not China which does not recognize Britain. It is Britain which does not recognize us in the United Nations.” Eden said: “Britain is also dissatisfied with China on some [other] things, but I do not want to mention these things when we are dining together today.” Talking about the improvement of Sino-British relations, Eden said: “I brought the British Chargé in the People's Republic of China, [Humphrey] Trevelyan here this time [to let him] meet with the Chinese delegation.” I said: “I also brought the Director of the Department of West European and African Affairs, Huan Xiang, here.” Eden said: “Well, we have some thoughts in common.” Trevelyan came to see us immediately after the meeting and had already arranged to invite Huan Xiang to dinner next week.(4) The issue of British-American relations. Molotov said: “The United States is intentionally creating tensions, and it makes the American people very jittery. This kind of situation does not exist in the Soviet Union. I assume that Britain does not like that either.” Eden said: “Although the United States [government] talks a lot, the American people are peace-loving.” Molotov then said: “Britain is an influential country in the West, and shares the same language with the United States. Britain should not underestimate its role in improving relations between East and West.” Eden said: “You are flattering me. Industrial development in the United States exceeded ours after World War II. It also replaced Britain as the world's leader. Although we are not jealous, the United States is too impatient.” Eden then cited a playwright [to the effect of]: “We have nothing in common with the United States except the same language.” I said: “Since the United States is not reconciled to the loss of China, it uses every means at its disposal to threaten and massacre people, especially the Chinese people. However, the Chinese people are not afraid of these threats. The American way of doing things only made its own people nervous.” Eden said: “The Americans have some reason to be dissatisfied. The Americans kindly helped China during its war against Japan. However, China repaid kindness with ingratitude.” I said: “The United States helped [Republic of China (ROC) President] Jiang Jieshi [Chiang Kai-shek] oppress and kill Chinese people. How could it not lead to the resistance of the Chinese people?” Eden said: “In fact, the British loss in China was greater than that of the Untied States.” I said: “If we do accounts in history, Britain did not lose anything.”(5) The issue of the Five Powers [i.e., the UK, the US, France, the PRC, and the Soviet Union. Eden said that he does not care if it is Four or Five Powers, the subcommittee should be composed of seven countries. Molotov said: “This is a good attitude. However, some people do not want to talk about the Five Powers.”Foreign journalists spread the rumor after the dinner that Eden had met with Dulles before his meeting with me. It was said that Dulles was very dissatisfied with Eden's action. Trevelyan invited [PRC Vice Trade Minister] Lei Renmin for dinner last night. The Deputy Under Secretary for Administration in the British Foreign Office, [Harold] Caccia, and the Assistant Under Secretary [for Foreign Affairs, William Dennis] Allen, were also present at the dinner. Trevelyan stated that three British trade organizations were willing to do business with China. Lei said that the representatives of the three organizations could first come to meet with [the Chinese delegation] at Geneva in order to find out detailed information. Trevelyan agreed with him. Trevelyan also invited Lei to come to Britain and visit the industrial exhibition. The Indian ambassador to Switzerland [Yezdi D. Gundevia] came to see me yesterday morning and asked for information about the Geneva Conference.

142,"Telegram, Zhou Enlai to Mao Zedong and Others, Regarding the Situation at the Tenth Plenary Session",19540514,"Chairman Mao, Comrade [Liu] Shaoqi and the Central Committee: (I) The British and French delegations spoke for the first time yesterday at the tenth session regarding the Korean issue. Bidault and Eden not only reacted to our criticism, but also defended the United Nations and affirmed their positions to the United States. In addition, Bidault made detailed proposals. He emphasized two things: (1) The unified government must be proportionally elected based on the number of citizens in both North and South Korea; (2) The elections must be monitored and certified by observers from neutral nations who have supervisory authority. The selection of members for the international supervisory body should be based on the most balanced conditions in order to guarantee the objectivity of their opinions. Only United Nations organizations are eligible to choose such observers. Elections as well as the withdrawal or movement of [foreign] troops should also be placed under international supervision. In his speech, Bidault attacked the [North] Korean and Soviet delegations by name. However, he did not refer to China. Eden said that the POW issue had already been resolved (we plan to let our spokesman denounce this declaration in a written statement). Afterwards he referred to the British attitude toward the Asian issue. Eden disagreed with the argument concerning ?the tendency of Western countries to ignore or oppose Asian nationalist sentiment.? He boasted that India and Pakistan both decided to stay in the British Commonwealth of their own free will. Eden made five proposals on the Korean issue: 1. Elections must be held. It is necessary to establish an all-Korean government. 2. Elections should consider the population distribution in both North and South [Korea]. 3. Elections should be based on universal adult suffrage and confidential ballots. [Elections] should be held as soon as possible under conditions of true freedom. 4. The international supervision under the United Nations should be conducted by countries that are acceptable to this conference. 5. Conditions that will enable foreign troops to withdraw should be created. The United Nations forces will withdraw after they achieve the establishment of peace and security in Korea.The main issues of Eden's statement were international supervision, elections based on the distribution of population, and the subject of how to withdraw foreign troops. However, his speech was ambiguous. It is obvious that he is attempting to bargain with us. (II) After yesterday's meeting, Eden took the initiative in sounding us out through his secretary. He proposed coming to see me this morning at the villa. I agreed to see him. I have already consulted with the Soviet delegation about how to deal with him. I will report the result of the meeting later.

He mostly wanted to gauge my opinion on the Indochina issue and said that he hoped to hold a restricted session. I did not answer his five questions on the Indochina issue directly except to give my support to Pham Van Dong's proposals. I simply asked him indirectly to explain what he meant by “all forces should be concentrated in the determined areas.” He said that it meant that troops of both sides should be withdrawn to areas determined by their respective commanders, and that this plan should then be ratified by the Geneva Conference. I therefore perceived that Britain does have a plan to delimit [the country]. However, it is still not clear that the British want to delimit [the country] between North and South, or to handle Haiphong differently. Nevertheless, it is obvious that France and the United States do not want to withdraw from the Red River Delta. I have already cabled the summary of my conversation with Eden separately. I agreed to hold a restricted session after consulting with the Soviet, Chinese, and Vietnamese delegations.(2) Molotov spoke first at the fourth session on the Indochina issue this afternoon. He attacked both Bidault's misrepresentation of history and Bao Dai's legal status, and supported Pham Van Dong's statement on anti-colonial rule and colonial war. The main point of Molotov's speech was to make the commission of neutral nations' supervision of the armistice a supplementary proposal. He said that he could not completely agree to the international guarantee stated in France's proposal. Specifically, he agreed to guarantee jointly collective consultation and collective action, but refused to agree to individual actions. Please refer to TASS's broadcasts to see the full text of Molotov's speech. Bidault and the Laotian delegation also made speeches at the session. Bidault still behaved like a colonialist. He refused to recognize the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and expressed his support of Bao Dai and the kingdoms of Cambodia and Laos. Although Bidault still repeated his unreasonable arguments, his tone was relatively milder than on the two previous occasions he spoke. He accepted Pham's basic position on peace, independence, unification and democracy. However, he said that all these had already been accomplished. Bidault also responded one by one to Pham Van Dong's eight proposals, besides explaining three of his own. Bidault said that France had already recognized Vietnam's autonomy and independence throughout the country as well as the independence of Cambodia and Laos. Cambodia and Laos had already signed agreements with France and became members of the federation. Therefore, Pham Van Dong's first and fourth points became unnecessary. Concerning Pham's second point, Bidault said that French troops in a country which is an ally of France cannot be considered as typical “foreign” troops. However, France, on the advice of interested governments, should be prepared to recall its own forces if invading troops will also be withdrawn. Bidault believed that the Laos and Cambodia issues could be resolved simply by withdrawing the Viet Minh troops. However, he argued that in discussions the Laos and Cambodia issues should be separated from the Vietnam issue. Regarding Pham's third point, Bidault said that elections must be supervised. A political solution will only be possible after a military settlement. The process of negotiating a political solution will only delay the implementation of a military settlement. On Pham's fifth point, Bidault stated that since Vietnam had already consulted with France about the economic and cultural interests of France in Vietnam, these would never be conditions [to concluding hostilities]. Bidault agreed to the sixth and seventh points that Pham had raised. On the eighth point, Bidault said that 8(a) was ambiguous since it did not clarify whether or not the agreement on political conditions should be reached before the armistice. He emphasized that the ceasefire in Vietnam should be extended gradually from one region to another to reach a complete armistice. Bidault stated that Pham's proposals on concentration areas (for stationing troops) and readjustment areas were basically the same as the first point of the first section of the French proposal. Regarding the armistice in Laos, Bidault believed that it wouldn't be a problem as long as the Viet Minh withdrew its troops. He pointed out that 8(b), on transporting weapons across the border, needed additional and clearer regulations. On 8(c), on the issue of supervision, Bidault believed that international supervision is essential. Bidault also said that it was obvious that the Soviet delegation made the same argument in their speeches. He then proposed to disarm the irregular forces and once again raised the issue of the guarantee [of all these agreements] ensured by participants of the Geneva Conference. The speech of the Cambodian delegation still focused on the same old story of the withdrawal of the Viet Minh troops. It was announced at the end that there would be no meeting on the 15th, and a restricted session on the Indochina issue will be held next Monday.(3) In yesterday's meeting, Molotov took the initiative and proposed to let the commission of neutral nations supervise the armistice. His speech had a great impact on the meeting and was believed to have carried the meeting one step forward. Eden's visits to the Chinese and Soviet delegations and the agreement on holding a restricted session on the Indochina issue were also regarded as real progress. Thus the general discussion of the last three weeks finished. Discussions on substantial problems will start next week.(4) The Chinese and Soviet delegations exchanged opinions on the Indochina issue after the meeting. We also decided to prepare to discuss on the 15th and 16th the commonalities and differences in both sides' plans. We will also discuss what part can be agreed to and what part should be held or worked on. I will report the result after the discussions.(5) After the meeting between the Soviet, Korean, and Chinese delegations, we concluded that the current situation on the Korean issue is this: it will come to a deadlock if our counterparts cannot make new proposals except to emphasize repeatedly elections based on the distribution of populations under the supervision of the United Nations, and the withdrawal of the United Nations forces after achieving peace and security in Korea. As the next steps, we plan to make a compromise on the international supervision of elections. We will agree to let neutral nations supervise the elections, but not the United Nations. In addition, we will also emphasize two things: first, although we agree to let the neutral nations supervise the elections, these must be held after the withdrawal of foreign troops. Second, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission [NNSC] should be organized to supervise the elections and to prevent interference by domestic terror groups only after the all-Korean commission, in which both Koreas consult as equals, drafts an election law. This compromise can carry the meeting one step forward. However, we presume that our counterparts will make no concessions on the issue of equal rights. We plan to let the Chinese delegation propose this compromise. We would like to request the Central Committee's instructions on whether or not to raise the issue of the neutral nations supervising the Korean elections and also on how to raise this issue.

145,"Telegram, Zhou Enlai to Mao Zedong and Others, Regarding the Situation at the Ninth Restricted Session",19540601,"(Top Secret) Chairman Mao, Comrade [Liu] Shaoqi, and the Central Committee: (1) Comrade Molotov flew back to Moscow on the morning of the 30th [of May 1954]. He has already arrived today. On the afternoon of the 30th, the Chinese and the Soviet sides discussed their estimation of general situation of the conference. Molotov had met with Eden before he left. Regarding the Korean issue, Eden is inclined towards holding small meetings, to present proposals on general principles. Molotov did not accept that, nor did he refuse immediately at the time. He said that there should be a conclusion of the Korean issue so that it could consolidate the situation of the armistice in Korea to benefit peace. Eden agreed with that. We believe that we can hold restricted sessions. [We should] put aside [Republic of Korea Foreign Minister] Pyun Yung Tai's proposals and solely discuss basic principles for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and seek common ground for both sides so that we can reach some agreements. [We should present our proposal] as we presented the six-point proposal on the Indochina issue in order to make it more difficult for our counterparts to reject it completely. If our counterparts reject it completely, they are obviously unreasonable. After that it will be natural to let Nam Il present the second plan from our side. The Soviet friends basically agree with our opinions, and we also discussed them with and obtained approval from Comrade Nam Il. We have already formulated our own draft agreement for our side's principled agreement (see attachment). Concerning the Indochina issue, Molotov told Eden that after the six points of our proposal reached principled agreement or after discussing some political issues, the foreign ministers can return first and let the delegates stay to supervise and urge on the negotiations of the representatives of both sides' commanders. Eden agreed with that as well. He has already let the media know. We believe that it will take at least two weeks for the conference to accomplish the above tasks. Eden believes that the first two points of our six-point proposal regarding the principles of complete ceasefire and delimitation have already been solved through the resolutions passed on the 29th. Our counterparts want to discuss in particular the following four points, especially the issues concerning international supervision and international guarantee.(2) At the ninth restricted session on the Indochina issue on the 31st, our counterparts presented the issue of international supervision, as we expected. [Although] Smith did not present the issue of United Nations supervision at the meeting, he emphasized that the experience of the NNSC on Korea was not good and argued that our side did not act in good faith. He said that Poland and Czechoslovakia obstructed the NNSC's work and made it impossible for the NNSC to carry out its work in communist[-controlled] areas. Smith especially emphasized that communist countries could not be neutral and cited several paragraphs from the letters that Switzerland and Sweden sent to the Military Armistice Commission on 4 May and 7 May to prove his argument. I immediately spoke to refute Smith's statement. I first explained that the [North] Korean and Chinese sides do follow the armistice agreement, and Poland and Czechoslovakia are impartial. Several reports of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission are agreed to by Poland, Czechoslovakia and India. The biased ones are the other two members: Switzerland and Sweden. I affirmed that the work of the Korean NNSC had been basically successful, although they had met difficulties, and their difficulties came from the side of the United Nations forces. I used facts listed in Poland's and Czechoslovakia's two reports on 15 April and 30 April to prove that the United Nations forces created [those] difficulties for the NNSC. My conclusion is that we can use the experience of the Korean NNSC for reference. I also made it clear that when we discuss the issue of supervision it should be done in relation to other points. Also, we should have a joint commission consisting of members of both belligerents to supervise [the ceasefire] and to take charge of the implementation of the provisions of the [armistice] agreement. Gromyko spoke to support China's six-point proposal and explained and affirmed it point by point. In speaking of the membership of the organization of neutral nations' supervision, Gromyko suggested that India, Poland, Czechoslovakia and Pakistan [should be the members]. Our counterparts did not respond to this on the spot. Bidault's statement had two main points: 1) The main task of the international supervision in Laos and Cambodia is to ensure the withdrawal of the invading Viet Minh troops, not to supervise the armistice. 2) The representatives of both sides join the work of the international supervision committee. However, the Neutral Nations Commission should have supreme authority over and lead the joint commission.Bidault also presented the issues of the composition of the NNSC and the authority to which the NNSC should be responsible. He hinted that the NNSC should be responsible to the United Nations. In addition to giving his support to Smith's proposal, the Cambodian delegate also repeated his shibboleth that regrouping zones do not exist in Cambodia and that the Chinese delegation's proposal applies only to Vietnam. Pham Van Dong spoke to refute Smith's argument that only non-Communist countries could be neutral countries and gave his support to the Chinese delegation's conclusion on the supervision issue. Pham Van Dong claimed at the meeting that he had already appointed [DRV Vice Defense Minister General] Ta Quang Buu as representative of the command. He also proposed that Ta Quang Buu's assistant meet with the French military representative on 1 June to discuss and decide technical questions, such as the date by which representatives of the commanders of both sides start working.(3) After the meeting, the Soviet, Vietnamese, and Chinese sides agreed to draft some principles concerning the joint commission, the NNSC, and the international guarantee in order to unify the understanding of the three delegations of our side. (4) There is no meeting today and we had outside conference activities. Eden invited me for dinner tonight. Bidault said that he wanted to meet with me outside the conference. However, he was afraid that the Americans would find out about this and asked [us] not to let the journalists know in advance. I already agreed with that and agreed to visit him tonight at 10:00 p.m. after Eden's banquet.Zhou Enlai 1 June 1954 ","['Zhou, Enlai, 1898-1976 ']","['Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission', 'Geneva Conference (1954)', 'Indochinese War, 1946-1954--Peace']"
146,Zhou Enlai’s Report to the Central Committee about His Contacts with Robert Eden and Georges Bidault,19540602,"1. [Excised by the Department of Archives of the PRC Ministry of Foreign Affairs.] 2. Yesterday, military representatives from both sides began contact. Preliminary agreements have been reached regarding the date and other procedures of formal talks by the representatives of commanders-in-chief of both sides. Formal talks will begin today. 3. Last night I attended the banquet held by Eden. Eden mainly mentioned four issues: a. Eden informally expressed [his opinion] that he did not support the participation of Poland and Czechoslovakia in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. He said that it would be better if the supervision was carried out by Asian countries. I said that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission on Korea consisted only of European countries, and that some people opposed it. A commission consisting entirely of Asian countries would have disadvantages (I gave the example that it would be inappropriate for China as an Asian country to have supervision of the Kashmir problem). This time around it would be best if the commission could include both Asian and European countries, as proposed by Gromyko. b. Eden expressed the wish that the representatives of the commanders-in-chief of both sides would open the maps and solve some specific problems. c. Eden asked whether the conference would come to a conclusion in ten to fifteen days. I replied that it would depend on the efforts by both sides to reach an agreement. d. Eden said that since the United Kingdom has [British Chargé d'Affaires in Beijing Humphrey] Trevelyan in Beijing, he hoped that China would send its counterpart of Trevelyan to the United Kingdom. I have agreed. 4. I visited Bidault at 10:00 yesterday evening. On the one hand, Bidault explained that he wanted to reach an agreement and not fight World War III; on the other hand, he threatened that if an agreement could not be reached, there would be danger. I pointed out that the danger would be intervention by the United States and the threat to China's security—these are the things that concern us the most. Bidault expressed his hope that the representatives of the commanders-in-chief of both sides could resolve some specific problems. He also emphasized that the issue of international supervision should be addressed as well. Although Bidault had said beforehand that he wanted to discuss some problems, he did not go deeply into the problems yesterday evening, nor did he bring up specific questions.

147,"Telegram, Zhou Enlai to Mao Zedong and Others, Regarding the Situation at the Tenth Restricted Session",19540603,"(Top Secret) Chairman Mao, Comrade [Liu] Shaoqi, and the Central Committee: (1) Yesterday morning, the Soviet, [North] Korean, and Chinese sides met and agreed that we should try to hold a plenary session on the Korean issue this week. [We will] let Nam Il refute [South Korean Foreign Minister] Pyun Yung Tai's proposal and statements by the other delegations that supported Pyun. Although I will also speak to refute Pyun, I will emphasize the necessity and effectiveness of the neutral nations' supervision of the all-Korean free elections. As I reported in a previous telegram, we are planning to let the Soviet side present the “draft agreement regarding basic principles for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue by the participating countries of the Geneva Conference.” (2) Yesterday, at the tenth restricted session on the Indochina issue, Bidault presented a comprehensive plan regarding the issue of the neutral nations' supervision. Its major points are as follows: 1.The NNSC has five functions:(a) to supervise the regrouping of troops; (b) to supervise the movement of troops; (c) to investigate incidents that violate the armistice agreement in non-military zones; (d) to supervise the prevention of new troops and arms being introduced across the borders of Indochina. However, this point is still not quite clear; (e) to supervise the issue of the release of POWs and civilian internees.2. The NNSC should set up local commissions and ad hoc subcommissions; the decisions of all levels of international commissions should be taken by a majority;3. The joint commission of both sides should function under the authority of the NNSC; 4. Regarding the issue of the composition of the NNSC, Bidault disagreed with Gromyko's proposal and said: [“] Communist countries cannot be neutral[”]. He also quoted from Chairman Mao's On New Democracy that “neutral is simply a deceiving word.” However, he did not say that he agreed with those countries. Bidault especially emphasized that what he had said should only apply to Vietnam since the mission and organizational style of neutral nations' supervision in Laos and Cambodia is different from that in Vietnam. Smith spoke and cited Switzerland and Sweden's letter to the Military Armistice Commission on 4 May (the original letter was distributed after the meeting) to explain that the United Nations forces did not violate the armistice agreement. The Korean NNSC was unable to carry out its work because of the two communist members' obstruction. He said that none of the communist countries could be considered neutral countries, nor could they take charge of supervision. Therefore, he opposed Poland's and Czechoslovakia's participation and was [only] willing to accept India and Pakistan [as members of the NNSC]. I spoke immediately to refute Smith's statement and cited Poland's and Czechoslovakia's letters dated 15 April, 30 April, 8 May, and 20 May as proof (the original letters were distributed after the meeting). I expressed my support for Gromyko's proposal and pointed out that [we] should not confuse the non-neutrality of political thoughts with neutral nations that have not participated in the [Indochina] war. Eden made a statement and insisted that we should use Bidault's plan as a basis for discussion. He suggested that we should set up a technical committee to discuss the issues of functions and structure of the NNSC. Eden also suggested that the NNSC should be composed of Asian nations and emphasized that the joint commission of both sides should be subject to the command of the NNSC. Molotov spoke to refute Smith's statement[:] “if Smith basically opposes communist countries joining the NNSC it means that he does not want to settle the problem. This attitude hampers the settlement. Such an attitude that denies all non-capitalist countries a role in the NNSC is close to the thoughts of the anti-communist league.” Molotov also cited documents signed jointly by four member countries of the Korean NNSC acknowledging that the United States violated the [armistice] agreement. However, [he] explained that the NNSC was still effective despite these weaknesses and that the four countries could reach an agreement. The four neutral countries that the Soviet Union proposed included two Asian countries and two European countries. Among those countries, two of them had diplomatic relations with France and the other two with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. They will be able to reflect the opinions of both sides. (3) Our counterparts have not yet reached a consensus on the issue of the composition of the NNSC. They were unable to make any suggestions at the meeting. Based on newspaper [accounts], it seems that France does not agree with the Southeast Asian countries completely. (4) I will report the situation at yesterday's first formal meeting of the representatives of commanders of both sides in a separate telegram.

148,"Telegram, Zhou Enlai to Mao Zedong and Others, Regarding the Situation at the Eleventh Restricted Session",19540604,"Chairman Mao, Comrade [Liu] Shaoqi, and the Central Committee: (1) Bao Dai's delegate said at yesterday's eleventh restricted session on the Indochina issue that only the United Nations could take charge of the task of supervising. Bidault spoke to support Bao Dai's delegate and said: [“] the NNSC should be responsible to the United Nations.[”] In addition to repeating that the organization of the joint commission of both sides cannot apply to Laos and Cambodia, Bidault also emphasized that the joint commission should function under the authority of the NNSC so that the NNSC can serve as a judicial [organization]. However, since [the members of] the joint commission are parties concerned [in the war]; parties concerned cannot act as judges at the same time. Therefore, the joint commission can only function as a tool and cannot take major responsibilities for supervision. Smith stated the US preference for the United Nations as supervisory authority. However, he said that he probably will not assert this. Smith said: [“] four countries, Switzerland, Sweden, India, and Pakistan are suitable to take charge of supervising, however, [China, the Soviet Union, and Vietnam] must disagree [”]. He suggested that the two chairmen should discuss the issue of composition in private. I made statements not only resolutely opposing the United Nations supervision, but also pointing out that the relationship between the NNSC and the joint commission should be equal. The NNSC was by no means to be over the joint commission. Since the two belligerent sides are the main parties concerned, whether or not the armistice agreement can be carried out depends on both sides' sincerity. The joint commission of both sides should take major responsibility. The division of work between the two is: the function of the joint commission is to supervise the implementation of the provisions of the armistice; meanwhile, the function of the NNSC is to supervise and inspect whether or not the two sides have violated the provisions of the armistice agreement. The NNSC's functions either inside or outside Indochina will be two-fold: one is to supervise demilitarized areas; the other is to supervise throughout Indochina and along common frontiers with other countries the prohibition of introducing new troops, military personnel, and arms and ammunition, whether by land, sea, or air. Thus within Indochina there would be two kinds of organizations working together. However, the NNSC will be directly responsible for supervising along the borders. Regarding the issue of to whom the NNSC should report, I pointed out that I agreed with Bidault's original proposal to let the nine [conference] participants guarantee. Chairman Eden agreed to discuss the issue of the composition of the NNSC in private. He stated that a restricted session on the Indochina issue will be held today and a plenary session on the Korean issue on the 5th. The 6th is [Sunday]. A restricted session on the Korean issue will be held on the 7th and a plenary session on the Indochina issue on the 8th.(2) The Soviet, Vietnamese, and Chinese sides are discussing issues concerning the functions of the members of the joint commission and the NNSC, the relationship between the two committees, and the international guarantee. We are also drafting detailed provisions now. I will report later after we have made decisions.

149,"Telegram, Zhou Enlai to Mao Zedong and Others, Regarding the Situation at the Twelfth Restricted Session",19540605,"Chairman Mao, Comrade [Liu] Shaoqi, and the Central Committee: (1) Our counterparts did not refer to the issue of United Nations supervision at yesterday's twelfth restricted session because of our resolute opposition on the 3rd. What I referred to on the 3rd concerning the issue of the functions and authorities of the joint commission, of the NNSC and of the international guarantee [commission], and the issue of the relationship among these three bodies have already caught our counterparts' attention. Eden said yesterday that my proposal that the NNSC should be responsible to the Geneva Conference participants who have the task of guaranteeing the agreements is worthy of careful consideration. Eden also suggested that the participants should set up a permanent [supervisory] organization. Bidault stated that the French proposal has something in common with mine and hinted that he agreed with Eden on the establishment of a permanent organization. Bidault said that impartial arbiters are needed. He emphasized that the neutral organization must have the authority of supervision and a great number of staff. Bidault also reiterated his two original opinions[:] the joint commission should be subordinate to the NNSC; the current proposal concerning supervision should only apply to Vietnam and the supervision of Laos and Cambodia needs to be decided separately. See attachment for Bidault's original proposal. Smith spoke next and did not oppose the conference participants joining in [the international] guarantee. However, he still emphasized that the NNSC should have superior authority over the joint commission. Regarding my proposal, Smith said: [it] simply will be a framework for agreements that this conference might reach. However, we must solve two problems first:1. the impartial composition of the international supervisory commissions;2. the nature of the obligations of the countries who participate in guaranteeing the agreements.Molotov spoke and agreed that the NNSC should be responsible to the Geneva [Conference] participants who join in the international guarantee. He also pointed out that the agreement by both belligerents has decisive meaning in solving the conflict. The joint commission can also play an important role. Therefore, it should not be subordinate to outside power. In addition, no such subordination exists [in case of the joint bodies representing the belligerents] in Korea. Molotov also refuted three points of [our counterparts'] arguments:1. If, as [our counterparts] said, communist countries cannot be neutral and can only constitute one side [of the negotiations], then capitalist countries cannot be neutral either. This argument violates the United Nations Charter since the UN Security Council, the Economic and Social Council, and the International Court of Justice are all composed of different countries of different political and economic systems.2. The United Nations has nothing to do with this conference. China, a country of half a billion people, and the majority of the participants of this conference are not members of the United Nations. Therefore, the United Nations should not take charge of international supervision. 3. The NNSC must cover not only Vietnam but also Laos and Cambodia. (2) Molotov put some pressure on our counterparts at yesterday's meeting since they delayed the establishment of contacts between the representatives of the two commands in the field and expressed hope that these would be established in the near future.(3) Eden went back to Britain last night. [The conference will] discuss the Korean issue today and next Monday. We will use these two, three days to revise our detailed proposal on the issues of the joint commission, the NNSC and the international guarantee. I will send another telegram to report again after the Soviet, Vietnamese and Chinese sides have made a decision.

150,"Telegram, Zhou Enlai to Mao Zedong and Others, Regarding the Situation at the Thirteenth Plenary Session",19540606,"Chairman Mao, Comrade [Liu] Shaoqi, and the Central Committee: (1) At yesterday's plenary session on the Korean issue, we took steps to make the meeting a restricted one in which we could solve the problem. In order to do this, we took the initiative in adopting a conciliatory attitude and seeking subjects on which agreement could be reached. The Korean, Chinese, and Soviet delegations all spoke in the session. I have already sent back all three texts of the speeches. Nam Il stated that the DPRK was not opposed to the phased and proportional withdrawal of foreign troops. He cited the examples of the United States and Switzerland in order to refute his counterparts' arguments concerning the organization of an all-Korean government based on the proportional representation of populations. I spoke to emphasize that we could find common ground on which to settle the Korean issue peacefully. At the meeting, Molotov submitted his draft concerning ?basic principles and agreements on a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue.? Although I have already cabled the text of his draft, I need to add three more sentences to one of the sections. Specifically, ?elections should be held within six months after the conclusion of this agreement. Elections should be conducted by secret ballot based on the laws of universal suffrage. Representation in the all-Korean legislature should be in proportion to the population of Korea as a whole.? Since three statements from our side all indicated that we tried to seek common ground, the Dutch delegation said in their speech that they would examine Molotov's proposals immediately after he spoke.Smith and [ROK Foreign Minister] Pyun Yung Tai were afraid that our efforts to reach an agreement would have a positive influence on the conference. Pyun Yung Tai therefore made a special speech refuting Nam Il's arguments. Smith also spoke to attack my proposal for neutral nations' supervision [on elections in Korea]. He emphasized that elections must be supervised by the United Nations. He even hinted at last that he would use public opinion to threaten us. I immediately made a brief statement saying that we could not agree to Smith's explanation for the NNSC's role in the Korean issue. I also reserved my right to reply to other parts of Smith's statement to which we could not agree in the future. (2) According to the media, the 16 countries of the other side held a meeting yesterday in the morning. The United States intended to sabotage the negotiations on the Korean issue. However, other countries did not agree. Obviously, it is the United States that intentionally creates tension both inside and outside the conference. The Americans are trying to win support under the signboard of the United Nations. They are afraid that our side will undermine the United Nations' prestige, and that we will desperately oppose the exercise of veto over the issue of neutral nations. They are afraid that an organization of neutral nations on a footing of equality with both sides will be unfavorable to the United States. (3) In order to expose America's plot to sabotage [the conference], our side is preparing to provide further specific materials that affirm the achievements of the NNSC on the Korean issue and the effectiveness of the Four Nations' Agreement. We will also provide materials to prove that the United States violated the armistice agreement and disrupted the NNSC. Concerning the propaganda issue, we plan to compare our conciliatory attitude and America's disruptive one during the conference. It will show clearly that our side is trying its best to seek common ground.

151,"Telegram, Zhou Enlai to Mao Zedong and Others, Regarding Zhou’s Conversation with Bidault (Excerpt)",19540610,"Chairman [Mao Zedong], Comrade [Liu] Shaoqi, and the Central Committee: In the evening of the 7th, Bidault visited me and discussed mainly the issue of neutral nation supervision. He stated that the nature of the Korean issue was different from that of the Indochinese issue so the precedent case of Korea did not apply to Indochina. He didn't agree that Poland and Czechoslovakia join the supervision of Indochina. Regarding the membership, he said that only India and Pakistan were neutral nations, and that a neutral nation should be identified and accepted by all sides. But he didn't mention any specific nation for a probe. During our conversations, Bidault expressed his willingness for peace, and he also hinted at us Anthony Eden and Zhou Enlai at the Geneva Conference (courtesy PRC Ministry of Foreign Affairs Archives) not to apply any military pressure. He said, “Don't worsen the military situation to slow progress. A military situation will cause negative political reactions. Do not continue the war while discussing peace, and do not use the war to antagonize the public feeling of the other side.” On one hand, Bidault said that he hoped to obtain a cease-fire under the condition that the historical relationship between France and the three countries, Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, was kept in mind. On the other hand, however, he said that he is opposed to mixing together discussion of military and political issues. Bidault also tried to find out [whether] a better chance for an agreement [would exist] if the Korean and Indochinese issues were discussed together or separately; and a possible result on the entire Asian issue if the discussions were conducted behind closed doors. I told him that the two issues certainly had impact on each other. They all should be solved, not just one, while leaving the other unsolved, or even trying to block any solution. Bidault said that he could avoid the impact of the development of the Indochinese issues on his government and media. He also said that, if necessary, he may have to mention his conversation with me in his speech that would be sent to the Assembly on Wednesday (the 9th). But he didn't state definitely that he would publicize this matter. He may want to use his contact with China to calm down the complaints in the Assembly, but he was afraid of upsetting America. Bidault also told me that he may have to talk aggressively and offensively at the public meeting on the 8th. He wanted to make a statement ahead that it “won't be a problem for me to continue the communication with the Chinese delegation thereafter.” During the conversation, Bidault emphasized that my opinion was very close to his. His conversations with me were more constructive than those with other people. I talked about the issues of neutral nation supervision, the experience of the Korean Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, and veto rights. I also emphasized that both sides should follow the conciliatory spirits and look for their common points.

152,"Telegram, Zhou Enlai to Mao Zedong and Others, Regarding the Situation at the Fourteenth Plenary Session",19540613,"(Top Secret) Chairman Mao [Zedong], Comrade [Liu] Shaoqi and the Central Committee: The delegations of six countries of the Western camp spoke at the open meeting on the Korean issue on the 11th. Six countries (France, with Britain and Canada taking the initiative among the other five countries and New Zealand, Belgium, and Thailand giving their support) stated unanimously that if the conference cannot reach any agreement on the Korean issue, it should be returned to the United Nations. Although Bidault is usually the least interested in the Korean issue, he suddenly became active at this meeting in order to obtain more votes when the French Parliament decides on the motion of confidence on the 12th. He returned from Paris and intentionally showed the spirit of conciliation in proposing five ambiguous principles at the plenary session on the Korean issue. In his proposals, Bidault briefly mentioned that elections should be held throughout the territory of Korea, and also raised the issues of the withdrawal of foreign forces and international supervision. However, instead of emphasizing the necessity of the United Nations' supervision, he simply said that “once the unification has been carried out under legitimate conditions, the UN should be called upon to give their sanction [to this settlement thus reached].” From our side, both Nam Il and I spoke and expressed our complete support of Molotov's five-point proposal presented on the 5th. We also proposed that the conference should adopt this proposal as the basis for further discussion. I not only fought back Smith's threatening statement on the 5th that he would appeal to world opinion, but also focused on exposing his plot to interrupt the negotiations. I pointed out that since both sides had already achieved agreement on several points and agreement might be possible on some other points, there was no reason for the conference not to continue. The current situation is that the United States and South Korea want to sabotage the negotiations on the Korean issue, however, other countries who attended the sixteen countries' meeting on the 4th did not agree. Since Molotov's five-point proposal on the 5th was full of the spirit of conciliation, it made it difficult for our counterparts to reject it completely. Therefore, the United States cancelled the planned restricted session on the Korean issue on the 7th. At the same time, the US is attempting to mold public opinion and is preparing to end the negotiations at the right moment. At the plenary session on the 11th, the United States therefore instigated the six countries to distort our arguments recklessly and to emphasize that the differences could not be resolved, and attempted to end the conference by proposing to return the Korean issue to the United Nations. However, through the six countries' delegations' statements, we perceived that there were still differences among them. Although all six countries defended the United Nations, five of them did not support Pyun Yung Tai's sixteen-point proposal directly. Neither was their support of the United States enthusiastic. Bidault's proposals were not quite in step with the other five countries' statements. Neither did he raise the issue of the United Nations' supervision. Bidault simply said that [the settlement of the Korean issue] should be reported to and obtain ratification from the United Nations. Therefore, it is still difficult for them to end the meetings on the Korean issue immediately. Our side plans to let Nam Il propose our second original plan in next week's meetings on the Korean issue.Zhou Enlai 13 June 1954 ","['Zhou, Enlai, 1898-1976 ']",['Korean reunification question (1945- )']
153,"Telegram, Zhou Enlai to Mao Zedong and Others, Regarding the Situation at the Fifteenth Plenary Session",19540617,"Chairman Mao [Zedong], Comrade [Liu] Shaoqi, and the Central Committee: (1) The Soviet, Korean, and Chinese delegations discussed our strategies on the Korean issue on the evening of the 14th. We assume that our counterparts will not accept the five-point proposal that Molotov presented on 5 June since they have already spread rumors outside the conference that the conference will be ended at the plenary session of the 15th. It will be difficult to present easily our side's second original plan (regarding the consolidation of peace in Korea) as well as the supplementary proposals that we originally planned to use as last steps. We must try to play every card we have at the last session. Even if we cannot prevent the conference from being sabotaged, we can at least drive our counterparts into an unfavorable position. The more modest our proposals are, the more passive our counterparts will be. It will also make it more difficult and more unreasonable of them to sabotage the conference. In addition, it will force our counterparts to take greater responsibility for ending the conference. Therefore we have decided that at the plenary session on the 15th, our side should: let Nam Il present proposals on the guarantee of peace in Korea; let me speak to support Nam Il's proposals and recommend that the conference should go into a restricted session of seven countries [China, the USSR, the UK, the US, France, the DPRK, and the ROK]; and let Molotov submit a [draft] declaration to guarantee that no action will be taken to threaten peace in Korea. We assume that our counterparts will accept none of these proposals. Therefore, at last, I will make a minimum proposal. Specifically, I will express our common desire for the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and propose to discuss the issues of time and place for the reopening of the negotiations. We presume that our counterparts will not even accept this minimum proposal since the United States' policy is basically not to reach any agreement.(2) At the fifteenth plenary session on the Korean issue on the 15th, Chairman Eden intentionally let our three delegations speak first. Nam Il made a six-point proposal on the guarantee of peace in Korea. I spoke to support Nam Il's proposals and suggested that the conference go into a restricted session of seven countries. Molotov proposed that the nineteen countries should publish a joint declaration assuring that no action will be taken to threaten the peace in Korea. It seems that Molotov's proposal for a joint declaration was beyond our counterparts' expectations. Thus, Eden immediately called for a short recess after our three delegations finished our speeches. The sixteen countries held an extraordinary meeting [during the recess] and requested an extension of the intermission. Although our counterparts did not reach a complete internal agreement at the time, the United States had already decided to sabotage the conference. Following the recess, our counterparts opposed discussing our side's proposals, and the Thai delegation presented the 16-nation joint declaration. They then declared the end of the conference. Molotov then made an overall statement on the Korean issue and pointed out that our counterparts should take the responsibility for sabotaging the conference. I spoke next and expressed my great regret that the 16-nation declaration announced its determination to end the conference. I then presented our minimum proposal. Specifically, that the nineteen countries should issue a joint statement indicating a common desire to achieve the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue on the basis of establishing a unified, independent, and democratic country of Korea. I pointed out that if they rejected this proposal, their rejection of negotiations could only have an unfavorable effect on future international conferences. This minimum proposal obviously threw our counterparts into confusion. After debating back and forth [among themselves], the Belgian delegate stated that he was not opposed to the spirit of my proposal and was ready to accept it. Eden agreed with the Belgian delegate's statement and asked the delegations if he could conclude that the conference had already accepted China's proposal. Nobody was responding at the time. Smith panicked and immediately took the floor himself with a statement against us. Eden then reversed himself and said that the conference had no procedure for voting. He pointed out that the conference would not be able to reach agreement on any of the proposals, and it was only possible to note the proposals as part of the record of the conference. I immediately praised the Belgian delegate's spirit of conciliation and said that it was also worth noting that Chairman Eden asked the delegations to consent to China's last proposal. At the same time, I criticized the opposition and obstruction of the US delegation and pointed out how the US delegation had been preventing the Geneva Conference from being able to arrive at even a minimal agreement. At the end Eden declared that the conference would note all proposals and statements as part of the record and that the meeting was adjourned. In sum, the Soviet, Korean, and Chinese delegations' repeated efforts disrupted our counterparts' arrangement and completely exposed America's decision to sabotage the conference.(3) At this point the sessions on the Korean issue ended. We are considering whether or not the Soviet Union, the DPRK, and China, the three countries of our side, should issue a joint statement or issue statements separately after we return to our countries summarizing the discussions on the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference and explaining them to the whole world.

154,"Telegram, CCP Central Committee to Zhou Enlai, Concerning Policies and Measures in the Struggle against the United States and Jiang Jieshi after the Geneva Conference",19540727,"Ambassador Zhang [Wentian], convey to Premier Zhou (top secret) Comrade [Zhou] Enlai: The Central Committee recently discussed the situation related to the Geneva Conference, and it believes that after the agreements in Korea and Indochina, the United States is unwilling to accept its failure at the Geneva Conference, and will inevitably continue to carry out the policy of creating international tension for the purpose of further taking over more spheres of influence from Britain and France, of expanding military bases for preparing for war, and remaining hostile to our Organization of Defense, and of rearming Japan. The United States will surely continue to use Taiwan to carry out pirate-style robberies of ships from various countries coming to our country, and it is likely to expand the sphere of blockade of our country to the areas off the Guangdong coast and to the Gulf of Tonkin area. Recently the United States and Jiang Jieshi have been discussing signing a US-Jiang treaty of defense, and the United States has repeatedly increased military aid to the Jiang bandits in Taiwan. All of this is worthy of our main attention. According to public information, it seems as if the United States still has some concerns about signing a US-Jiang treaty of defense, and it seems as if they have not made a final decision. But if the United States and Jiang sign such a treaty, the relationship between us and the United States will be tense for a long period, and it becomes more difficult [for the relationship] to turn around. Therefore, the central task of our struggle against the United States at present is to break up the US-Jiang treaty of defense and the Southeast Asian treaty of defense.We believe that after the victorious conclusion of the war of liberation on our mainland and the victorious armistice of the Korean War, now we are still facing another war, that is, the war against the Jiang Jieshi bandit bloc in Taiwan. Now we are still facing a task, that is, the task of liberating Taiwan. After the end of the Korean War, we failed to highlight the task [the liberation of Taiwan] to the people throughout the entire country in a timely manner (we were late by about six months). We failed to take necessary measures and make effective efforts in military affairs, on the diplomatic front, and also in our propaganda to serve this task. If we do not highlight this task now, and if we do not work for it [in the future], we are committing a serious political mistake. The introduction of the task is not just for the purpose of undermining the American-Jiang plot to sign a military treaty; rather, and more importantly, by highlighting the task we mean to raise the political consciousness and political alertness of the people of the whole country; we mean to stir up our people's revolutionary enthusiasm, thus promoting our nation's socialist reconstruction. In addition, we can use this struggle to enhance our fulfilling of the task of national defense, and learn how to carry out maritime struggle. Toward this issue the Central Committee has adopted the following measures: (1) In the political field, a propaganda campaign emphasizing that we must liberate Taiwan and exposing the Americans and Jiang has already begun at home. We are also prepared to issue a open statement about the Taiwan issue in the name of the foreign minister after your return to Beijing, which will be followed by a joint statement by the representatives of various parties. Then, in accordance with the two statements, broad, profound, and prolonged propaganda and education will be carried out among the people of the whole country. In addition, we are organizing broadcast specifically aimed at Taiwan. (2) In the military field, the Military Commission has already issued a special instruction for enhancing naval and air operations against the Jiang bandits in coastal areas. In the meantime, it is strictly regulated that the operation targets of our navy and air force should be restricted to Jiang Jieshi's military planes and vessels, and, toward American planes and warships, unless under the circumstance that they attack our troops, they are not permitted to take the initiative for attacks. The shooting down of a British transporter close to Yulin on 23 July was a mistake that is completely possible to be avoided. Apart from taking diplomatic measures to manage this, we also should use this accident to carry out serious education among our troops. (3) Considering that our struggles against the Americans and Jiang in the coastal area will be a matter of a very long period, and that our troops lack the capacity and experience for maritime struggles, it should become a long-range task to enhance the construction of our navy and air force. Our navy should follow a policy of first constructing boats and then constructing ships, and our air force should learn to carry out operations over the sea. In order to meet the needs of the struggle at the present time with urgency, we plan to increase orders for naval and air force equipment from the Soviet Union in the next three years. The Military Commission has put forward an order of 500 million rubles. There is no financial or budgetary difficulty for putting forward such an order. However, we should find more ways to get foreign aid. About this we will discuss and make decisions after you have come back home.Please report the above policies and measures to the comrades of the Soviet Party central leadership, and ask for their opinions.Apart from the above, the various aspects of domestic situation are good, except that the flooding disaster of this year is quite serious.

156,"Cable from the Chinese Foreign Ministry to Wang Bingnan, 'Instructions for the Third Meeting of the Sino-US Ambassadorial Talks'",19550803,"Top Secret[To] Ambassador Wang Bingnan:1. Summary account on the 2nd meeting on 2 August received.Our act of releasing eleven US spies before their sentence times expired has aroused broad responses among Asian countries, making the US position more passive. The US does not have many cards in its hand. As expected, the US seized the opportunity to ask us to release more civilians and plans to raise the issue of 500 missing US servicemen from the Korean War. Nonetheless, in his talk with journalists on 2 August, Dulles had to leave the door open for even higher-level talks. This demonstrates how hard the pressure [on the US] is from various sides. As to our policy, we decided in our cabled instructions on 31 July: only after the first agenda has achieved a certain result can we approve the exit and release of civilians. At present, our target of struggle is to win US concessions on the return of our nationals and students. The focus of this issue is to have India take care of the affairs of our nationals and students. In view of the inaccurate information at hand, it may be passive for us to propose a list of names. The best way to deal with this is to propose a total number (about 400 people) and some typical cases of the detained students. As to the other party’s complaints against us, you may give him a dose of his own medicine. Should the other party hand over a list of missing US military personnel, we may tell them honestly that these are old accounts which will not aid in settling issues. We have the issue of more than 14,000 Chinese People’s Volunteers who were captured. These people have actually been detained. We are not afraid of discussing this issue, but we think this kind of discussion will not aid in the settlement of current matters.At the meeting on the 2nd [of August], the other party spoke first. Our speeches addressed their issues. On the contrary, the other party failed to respond to our questions. Thus, at the meeting on the 4th [of August], we may invite the other party to speak first. If the other party declines to speak first, we may speak about the so-called issue of ill-feeling and ask the other party to state its attitude about our four proposals. Attached is an outline on the issue of “ill-feeling” and live examples of our students being prevented from returning for your proper use at the meeting.2. Telegraph dated 12:00 noon, 3 August received. Agree to your evaluation and manner of handling it. When reprimanding the other party as unreasonable for demanding the release of all US nationals, be careful. [It might appear as though] we are not going to release one more or everyone in any case. We should stress the importance of the efforts on both sides. As for the other party’s claim that there is no longer [a] hindrance for [Chinese] students to leave the US, and there is no need to entrust a third party, we should point out that we know there are many students who are willing to return. They dare not express their wishes, however, under various pressures. They may also be forced to change their minds after expressing their wishes to return. Many of them have financial difficulties. Thus, only after entrusting a satisfactory third party to look after their affairs could this matter be handled reasonably.Foreign Ministry3:30 a.m., 3 August",['China.

157,"Cable from the Chinese Foreign Ministry to Wang Bingnan, 'Talking Points for the Fifth Meeting'",19550810,"Top Secret[To] Comrade [Wang] Bingnan:[…][We] agree to your telegram of 3:00 p.m., 8 August, regarding the US willingness to reach an agreement and resolve some concrete issues.Western journalists have published many speculative reports about the Sino-American talks. The US Army fabricated stories about how we mistreated eleven US fliers and the US and [South Korean President Syngman] Rhee intentionally created tension over the Korean issue. But people all over the world, including American people, demanded results from the Sino-American talks. This puts pressure on the US, who has been forced to reach some agreements [with us] during the talk. The US has consented that India may investigate and aid in the return of Chinese nationals. This is a sign that the US is preparing to sign an agreement with us. If the US walks one step further, agreeing to provide a complete list of Chinese nationals in the US and agrees that India looks after Chinese nationals in the US, it is equal to the recognition of the People’s Republic of China. This is unlikely at present. In addition to offering an explanation to our proposal IV, as to proposal II, the US side also repeatedly claims to have lifted restrictions on the return of Chinese nationals, which applies to Qian Xuesen. Regarding proposal III, the US side also re-supplied a list of seventy-six Chinese students. Thus, we have nearly achieved our goals regarding our four proposals. Yesterday, we proposed to delay the fifth meeting for a day. This is because we need sufficient time in order to telegraph to you the text of the speech. [We hope] that an agreement will be reached on Agenda I on 11 August.The following items should be included in a possible agreement of 11 August.1. Both sides declare that nationals residing in the other’s countries, who desire to return, are entitled to depart [for their respective country] unless they have unfinished civil or criminal cases.2. To implement the aforementioned agreement, China entrusts India and the US entrusts the UK to aid their nationals in the other country on the issue of returning to their respective countries. The countries thus entrusted shall perform the following duties:(a) Upon the request of a civilian of one side residing in the other’s country who desires to return or upon the request of his government made on his behalf, the entrusted country shall make representations with the government of the country in which the civilian is residing with a view to settling his difficulty in departure;(b) In the event of a civilian of one side residing in the other who desires to return and who is being prevented from doing so, the entrusted country shall, upon his personal request or the request on his behalf by his government, conduct investigations and make representations with the government of the country in which the civilian concerned is residing, in accordance with the findings of the investigation with a view of arriving at a settlement;(c) In the event that a civilian of one side residing in the other desires to return and finds difficulty in paying for the return journey, the entrusted country shall render him assistance on behalf of his government.3. Upon the acceptance of the trusteeship described above by India and the UK in response to the requests of China and the US respectively, both sides shall give wide publicity to the details of this agreement by means of all available news media. India and the UK may also give similar publicity which they consider appropriate on the US and China respectively (This doesn’t exclude the publication of the complete text after today’s meeting).We’ll send to you the formal text of this agreement in another telegram.Before proposing this draft agreement on 11 August, [you should] make a speech, pointing out that the US has repeatedly promised the elimination of restrictions in accordance with our second proposal. The US also re-supplied a list of seventy-six Chinese students in accordance with our third proposal. We are satisfied with the arrangements. We have provided a complete list of all US nationals in China. But the US has not provided a list of all Chinese nationals in accordance with our first proposal. We express regret over that matter and declare to reserve our right to put forward this demand in the future (we would raise this matter again if the US bothers us on Agenda II issues).We should also point out that we are not satisfied with the US excuse of prolonged deliberation of our fourth proposal. But for the purpose of reaching an agreement on Agenda I, on the whole, we agree to US arrangements. We propose this draft agreement based on the positions of both sides presented in previous talks. At the end of your speech, you may say that once the draft agreement is reached, we should notify the US side of our decision on those US nationals who have applied to leave China.We will send to you the text of the speech in another telegram.Should the other party agree basically to our proposed draft agreement (You can make a decision without further instructions from the FM if the other party only asks for cosmetic revisions). At that point, you can notify the other party that you have received orders to notify the US side that nine US nationals who applied for departure have been approved to leave. If the other party delays in responding to our draft agreement, then don’t notify them of the granting of departure for nine US nationals (Don’t announce the three convicted US nationals mentioned in the previous plan and the one expelled from China for now). It is likely that the US side might propose a name list of about 470 American POWs and ask us to find out their whereabouts. We should reject such a name list. You may propose that if the other party agrees to transmit our demand to the US government and provide us with a complete list of Chinese nationals in the United States, we will accept a list of American POWs and transmit it to the Korean Military Ceasefire Commission. Otherwise, [you should] decline to accept it.   Foreign Ministry10 August 1955",['China.

On the Korean question, when I (Mao Zedong) was in Moscow [in December 1949-January 1950] we came to an understanding about everything, the issue was not about the seizure of South Korea, but about the significant strengthening of North Korea. But subsequently Kim Il Sung was in Moscow, where some kind of agreement was reached, about which no one considered it necessary to consult with us beforehand. It should be noted, said Mao Zedong, that there was a serious miscalculation in the Korean war about the supposed impossibility of intervention of international forces on the side of South Korea...P.

161,"Telegram from the USSR Ambassador to the DPRK Ivanov addressed to Mikoyan and Shepilov, 'August Plenum of the Korean Workers' Party Central Committee'",19560915,"SOVIET EMBASSY IN THE DPRKNº 254							  Top Secret15 September 1956							   Copy Nº 1PersonalTHE AUGUST KWP CC PLENUMTwo issues were examined at the KWP CC Plenum held 30-31 August 1956: 1. The results of the trip of a government delegation which visited fraternal countries and some pressing Party tasks. 2. The state of and the measures to improve work in public health.Kim Il Sung gave a report on the first issue and Pak Geum-cheol on the second. Appropriate decisions were adopted based on these reports.The trip of the government delegation to the USSR and the countries of people's democracy was characterized as an important step on the path to strengthening the international authority of the DPRK and the further development of the traditional friendship between the DPRK and the socialist countries.It was pointed out in the documents that the enormous economic aid which the socialist countries are giving again is a great contribution to the matter of the development of the economy and an increase of the material and cultural level of the people.The Plenum approved the discussions between the Government delegation and the governments of the fraternal countries and expressed deep gratitude for the new economic and technical aid given to the Korean people.The Plenum noted the commonality of the views found in the discussions with the fraternal countries on all the most important international issues.Touching the issue of the drafting of the first five-year plan for the development of the economy the Plenum pointed to the need to take into account the experience of the fraternal countries in the development of the economy, and to be guided by the principle of the division of labor which exists between the socialist countries.In connection with this the Plenum clarified several general provisions in the sphere of industry and agriculture advanced by the 3rd KWP congress. Whereas the main task of the three-year plan was to reach the prewar level of industrial production the main task of the first five-year plan was to be the construction of new enterprises, and the rebuilding, expansion, and equipping of existing enterprises with the newest technology. Then it pointed to the need to temporarily defer the construction of large industrial facilities requiring large capital investment and long periods of construction. All attention was to be devoted to the construction of enterprises of those industrial sectors where the country's natural and economic resources could be used with the greatest advantage.The Plenum noted that the main tasks of the five-year plan in the development of the economy should be done mainly with the personnel and resources of the DPRK. One could draw an assumption from this that a considerable part of the aid which will be allocated by the socialist countries will go to the improvement of the material situation of the workers of the country.In the area of the improvement of agriculture the Plenum stressed the need to struggle to increase the yield per unit of land, and to increase the land planted for high-yielding crops - rice, corn, potatoes, etc.The Plenum instructed that measures be developed in the near future to lessen the peasants' obligations to the state in order to further improve the peasants' material interest in agricultural production. An increase in the payment for the use of an irrigation system, the change of the system of procurement, and a partial reduction of the tax in kind for the poorest peasants are being envisioned.It is also being proposed to again reconsider the procedure for imposing taxes on private businessmen. Private traders will be granted the right to sell state goods to the consumer where there is no state or cooperative trading network. The private businessman is being granted the right to use local materials and the production waste of state enterprises for the manufacture of consumer goods.The Plenum also directed attention to the need to improve the state social security and insurance of workers.These measures in the industrial and agricultural sectors basically do not differ from the policy of the industrialization of the country adopted at the 3rd KWP congress. However, some clarifications made at the Plenum and, in particular, the abandonment of the construction of large facilities requiring large capital investment and long periods of construction demonstrates that after the trip the friends began to approach the issue of the rates and opportunities of industrializing the country more soberly, and began to speak more about the improvement of the extremely low standard of living of the country's population.However, the main thing in the work of the KWP CC Plenum was not the examination of the results of the trip of the government delegation, but the discussion of a serious situation which had developed in the Party.Dissatisfaction at the KWP CC had recent increased among some senior officials. Choe Chang-ik, Pak Chang-ok, So Hwi, Yun Gong-heum, Kim Seung-hwa and other prominent officials basically correctly think that it is impossible to put up with the big shortcomings in the leadership of the Party and country any longer.They consider the main shortcomings in the leadership of the Party and state to be that the work of the 3rd KWP congress and the activity of the CC were not permeated by the spirit of the 20th CPSU congress and the CC was not consistently realizing the Marxist-Leninist principles of Party policy. The spread of the cult of personality of Kim Il Sung and the assignment of senior personnel based on the principle of personal devotion has hampered the initiative and responsibility of government and Party organizations. As before, an atmosphere of mistrust and suspicion reigns in the Party. Essentially, there is a lack of a collegial working relationship in the work of the CC and Government. A serious economic situation has been created in the country.Kim Du-bong, Yun Gong-heum, and some others think that such senior officials as Pak Geum-cheol, Jeong Il-yong, Jeong [Dyun Tkhyak], Kim Chang-man, and some ministers promoted by Kim Il Sung are not trained and are not capable officials, and they should be replaced. At the Plenum it was also proposed to subject the main shortcomings of the activity of the leadership and Kim Il Sung personally to sharp criticism for the fact that he is not opposing the cult of his personality, for his incorrect approach to the selection and assignment of cadre, and for the fact that he does not know the real state of the population's lives. Some of those who were prepared to speak critically think that Kim Il Sung has been ruling the country with the aid of intrigues for the past 10 years. The campaign against Soviet Koreans organized by him at the end of last year was mentioned in this connection.Dissatisfaction at the situation which has developed in the Party included even some of the senior officials of the army and trade unions. This fact demonstrates the widespread dissatisfaction at the KWP leadership and says that national cadre have arisen in the Party who do not want to tolerate the serious shortcomings and are presenting increased demands to the leadership. Available information about the situation in the country and in the Party confirms that these senior officials have set as their goal the revelation of the large shortcomings which exist through sharp and bold criticism.As has been recommended, in the situation which has been created it would be most correct for Kim Il Sung to take charge of the criticism of the shortcomings in work, which would not only weaken, but strengthen the position of the KWP leadership. As is well known, the majority of senior officials who have expressed dissatisfaction waited for Kim Il Sung and hoped that on return from the USSR and the other fraternal countries that he would give a political report in the Presidium and then at the KWP CC Plenum in which a description would be given not only of the new aid, but also of the political life of the fraternal Communist Parties after the 20th CPSU congress, an analysis of the work of the KWP would be given on this basis, and the shortcomings and mistakes in the leadership of the KWP and the country would be revealed.However, this favorable situation was not used for criticism of the shortcomings and their elimination in the Party and government.Some facts indicate that Kim Il Sung incorrectly assessed the events which have occurred in the fraternal countries recently. He explained the demonstrations in Poznan in the CC Presidium as a lack of firm leadership in the Party in Poland after the death of Bierut and that the PUWP leaders told the people too broadly about the decisions of the 20th CPSU congress concerning the cult of personality of Stalin.After returning from the trip Kim Il Sung expressed himself in the sense that mistakes, including the cult of personality, ought to be eliminated gradually, without involving the entire Party in this matter.In the period of preparations for the next Plenum the KWP leadership was strongly concerned at the situation which had been created in the Party. After the well-known recommendation of Moscow was passed to Kim Il Sung it was considered correct and necessary at this stage to take charge of the criticism of shortcomings in the work of the CC in order to improve the situation.It was decided to postpone the convening of the CC Plenum from 2 August to the lasts days of the month in order to prepare themselves. Besides Kim Il Sung, we explained in detail to Pak Jeong-ae and Nam Il the need for the KWP leadership to take charge of the criticism and the elimination of the shortcomings and thereby strengthen the position in the Party and the country. However, the KWP leadership did not reckon with the opinion of Moscow, did not follow the path of criticism, and took every step in order to isolate those who intended to criticize the shortcomings and mistakes. All prominent officials about whom it was known that they intended to speak critically at the Plenum were summoned especially by Kim Il Sung, Choe Yong-geon, Pak Geum-cheol, Kim Il, and Pak Jeong-ae.The frank and bold opinions about the situation in the Party expressed by people who had been summoned by the KWP leadership, gave it a pretext to class all those dissatisfied in the category of a ""hostile anti-Party group"". This formula was then also employed at the CC Plenum.The issue of the cult of personality was covered in the report in connection with an examination of shortcomings in ideological work.It was recorded in the Plenum decision that the measures to overcome the cult of personality and its consequences adopted by the CPSU are a great lesson and example for all Marxist-Leninist Parties. The Plenum admitted that the cult of personality existed in the KWP to some degree but this did not exert a negative influence on the principle of collective leadership or on the political line of the Party, and that the CC had taken serious steps to eliminate manifestations of the cult of personality, in connection with which it was decided to republish works on history, textbooks, and handbooks in which particular issues are considered from a position of a cult of personality.It points out in the decision that, taking into account the difficult experience and lessons of the CPSU associated with the cult of personality of Stalin, the KWP should continue to educate Party members in the spirit of a complete eradication of the cult of personality. However, neither in the report nor the decision of the August Plenum does it frankly or in a Party way speak of the cult of personality of Kim Il Sung.Other very important issues of Party and government life of the DPRK which trouble the broad Party masses were not discussed at the Plenum. Such painful issues in the Party as the revival of the Leninist principles and norms of Party life, the develop of collegiality in the leadership, the elimination of the combining of Party and government posts in the same hands, the elimination of suspiciousness and mistrust among senior officials, and the observation of legality have not found their solutions. The Plenum also said almost nothing about the improvement of the living and financial conditions of the people.The report of Kim Il Sung, not having exposed the shortcomings of the Party leadership, naturally could not satisfy the participants of the Plenum, especially those who had met to criticize these shortcomings.Thirteen people took part in the discussion of the report.Minister of Trade Yun Gong-heum declared that the spirit of the 20th CPSU congress was almost not felt at the 3rd KWP congress, that the KWP CC was not putting the ideas of Marxism-Leninism into practice consistently, and that senior cadre were being incorrectly selected and assigned. He cited as an example the promotion, with a violation of Party democracy, to the post of Deputy Chairman of the KWP CC of Choe Yong-geon, who was the leader of a petit bourgeois party for 10 years.Yun's speech caused a heated reaction from the CC leadership. His speech was interrupted by Kim Il Sung and by especially rude and insulting retorts from Choe Yong-geon and other leaders.Yun's speech was characterized as anti-Party and provocative. He was deprived of the opportunity to continue his speech.All the succeeding orators touched on Yun's speech in one way or another, characterizing it as hostile, and Yun himself was characterized as a morally corrupted person.Choe Chang-ik spoke in defense of Yun's speech. In the words of some of the Plenum participants he said that the KWP policy is correct, but that it was necessary to talk about the cult of personality, a painful issue of the Party, and about the mistakes committed by the KWP CC. Choe was asked many questions, from which it became clear that he was being considered an ideologist of a factional group and he was deprived of an opportunity to end his statement.Pak Chang-ok spoke of some shortcomings in the work of the KWP CC and pointed in particular to the fact that the December Plenum had adopted an incorrect decision with respect to him, and he denied his connection with the ""anti-Party group"", not considering the group of dissatisfied people to be such. Pak also was not allowed to speak by the retorts from the Presidium and the hall.Choe Yong-geon sharply attacked Yun, Choe Chang-ik, and Pak Chang-ok, pointing out that Yun had submitted a full-fledged program against the Party and government to the Plenum in which the history of the Party, the economic situation of the country, the issue of the cult of personality, and [the issue] about the assignment of cadre in the Party were distorted. The factional activity of the group of Choe Chang-ik and Pak Chang-ok is a continuation of the dirty work of the group of Pak Il-u, who worked out a program of action against Kim Il Sung at one time.Kim Il Sung spoke twice in connection with the criticism of the KWP CC leadership at the Plenum. In the opinion of participants of the Plenum, he did not speak of the intra-Party issues which had come to a head, devoting the main attention to the ""anti-Party group"" headed by Choe Chang-ik and Pak Chang-ok which, as he thinks, set as their goal the overthrow of the current leadership and the seizure of power into their own hands. He again repeated the story spread by them that a representative of the CPSU had come to the Soviet Embassy with the object of establishing order in the KWP. There is hardly a need to talk about what, in Kim Il Sung's words, he does not believe himself.At Kim Il Sung's suggestion, the Plenum decreed that So Hwi, Yung Kong-hum, Ri Pil-gyu, and Kim [Gan] were to be expelled from the Party for anti-Party activity. Choe Chang-ik was expelled from the Presidium and the CC and Pak Chang-ok [was expelled] from the CC, and the Party commission was instructed to examine the issue of their Party-mindedness. Both of them were released from the posts of Deputy Chairman of the Cabinet of Ministers, Pak Chang-ok was sent to logging and Choe Chang-ik to a pig farm. The families of these people were put under the strictest police surveillance and removed from material allowances and medical service.Yun Gong-heum, So Hwi, Ri Pil-gyu, and Kim [Gan], feeling the threat of reprisal hanging over their heads, crossed the Chinese border without waiting for the end of the work of the Plenum. In the opinion of the Chinese Ambassador in the DPRK the crossing of the four senior leaders into the PRC complicates relations between the two countries.Deputy Minister of Defense Kim [Won Sun], Deputy Chief of the Military Academy Ri [Ur Gyu], and Chief of the Political Department of the Naval Directorate of the KPA Ri [Yn Ho] are being called to account concerning the case of the ""anti-Party group"". Two deputy chairmen and the chief of the organization department of the Pyongyang KWP City Committee have been removed from the post they occupied. Ambassador Ri Sang-jo, who is accused of ties with people who conducted espionage for Britain, has been recalled from Moscow and it is also intended to hold Kim Seung-hwa and Minister of Communications Kim Chang [Hyp] responsible in connection with this as co-participants of the ""anti-Party group"".Yun Gong-heum, Choe Chang-ik, Pak Chang-ok, and others basically made correct criticism of the shortcomings of the KWP leadership for which they cannot be classified with the anti-Party group.One cannot agree with the opinion of Kim Il Sung that now the unity and solidarity of Party ranks have been achieved and the complex issues of intra-Party life have been solved. It is unlikely that the big shortcomings in the Party can be eliminated and the leadership strengthened with repressive measures. There are grounds to suppose that some of the senior KWP officials are expressing serious doubts of the correctness and need to employ measures of a repressive nature against those who are dissatisfied. Kim Il Sung is also expressing fear of what political assessment they might give in the Soviet Union about his position in the solution of intra-Party issues and whether the position he takes will be assessed as nationalist. Nam Il told about these fears of Kim Il Sung.The situation in the KWP continues to remain complex. During the time the KWP has existed a well-knit leadership nucleus has not developed in it. The selection and assignment of cadre in the KWP occurs according to the principle of devotion to Kim Il Sung. In recent years issues about a struggle with a different type, ""anti-Party and factionalist groups"", have often arise in the Party. Kim Il Sung and his close entourage are not taking vigorous steps to correct the mistakes in the KWP.[We] think it advisable to discuss the situation in the KWP together with the friends at a conference of representatives of a number of fraternal countries.SOVIET AMBASSADOR IN THE DPRK		[signature]							(V.

The Korean delegates limited themselves to several obviously previously memorized phrases to explain what had happened there at the KWP plenum.It was evident that they are avoiding going beyond the bounds of the instructions they have received and it is essentially useless to discuss the situation in the Party with them. A record of the conversation with the Korean delegation is being sent separately via VCh.Therefore it will not be possible to fulfill the CC instruction concerning the issues relating to the Korean Worker's Party in Peking. Summoning Kim Il Sung and the other Politburo members here might turn out to be impractical.It is not excluded that Kim Il Sung does not want to come there, especially since there is information that he has declared himself sick. The Koreans might consider departure of other Politburo members from the country difficult.Therefore, essentially the only means for a discussion of the situation in the Korean Worker's Party is to go to Pyongyang for a day or two with representatives of the CC of the Communist Party of China after an exchange of opinions with the Chinese comrades and discuss this issue there.If there are no other instructions from the CC, we will act accordingly.A.

He expressed that he fully supports the resolutions of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, [as well as] China’s Great Leap Forward, the People’s Communes, our general [political] line, and our opposition to Peng Dehuai’s right opportunist anti-Party clique. Kim said that the Korean [Workers’] Party is not surprised by Peng Dehuai’s opposition to the [Chinese Communist] Party and that this is [in fact] completely understandable. The Central Committee of the Korean Workers’ Party had quite a few concerns about Peng Dehuai in the past, but did not raise these [questions about Peng to the Chinese Communist Party] out of a broader interest in protecting the unity of the two [Chinese and Korean] parties.

[The situation] has developed from a single individual or a single household crossing the border at night to [organized] groups forcefully crossing the border during daytime. According to incomplete statistics from Liaoning and Jilin Provinces, we discovered 4,701 people crossing the border (1,985 people from Liaoning) between January and April [1961], of which 3,381 people were able to successfully cross the border without being stopped (1,439 were from Liaoning). This situation has continued during May, and between May 1 and May 8, we have only been able to stop 350 people [from crossing the border]. These people are not only from Andong [Dandong], Anshan, and Luda [Lüshun-Dalian], but, according [to data], there are also people from Jilin, Heilongjiang, Beijing, and Tianjin. There are [also] 1,843 ethnic Korean households in Andong which are preparing to go to [North] Korea, of which 153 households have already sold all of their properties and attempted to sneak across the border. There are many reasons causing the increase in border crossings, though mainly it is because these people do not understand the temporary difficulties [facing] our country, and ideological education has not fixed this problem. Living arrangements have also not been properly arranged. The other issue is that the [North] Korean side is not returning the border-crossers, as is required by our [Chinese-Korean] agreement, and instead they have adopted measures to settle these people [in Korea]. For example, the [North] Korean side has established reception stations along the border crossing routes; they have also been returning unmarried Han [Chinese men] who crossed the border, but entire households that crossed over have been settled on agricultural cooperatives, and each laborer has received forty yuan as a settling-in allowance as well as a fixed amount of grain.In addition to actively carrying out [ideological] education among ethnic Korean residents [in China], [improving] living arrangements [for ethnic Koreans], and strengthening border [control], we ask that Ambassador Qiao [Xiaoguang] please meet with the [North] Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs and explain to him that if effective measures are not taken to stem the large numbers of ethnic Koreans crossing the border, there will not only be [negative] consequences for social order [in Northeast China], but adverse consequences will also appear in [other] ethnic minority regions [throughout China]. [Qiao] should request assistance from [North] Korea and ask the [North] Koreans to please mobilize as many border crossers as possible to return [to China]. As for people that cross the border in the future, [request] their timely return [to China]. We will make arrangements for the border-crossers who return, help them return home, and resolve difficulties in their work and life.

With socialist greetings[signed] [Sepp] SchwabAttachmentTranscriptTelegram No. 215 from 19 May 1961Sender: Ambassador SchneidewindTo: Comrade Stude/ Comrade Colonel SchützThere still exists no clear assessment by the North Korean comrades on current developments in South Korea.The statement published on 18 May by ZTAK [“Central Telegraph Agency of Korea;” KCNA] about the situation in South Korea does still contain significant contradictions. On the one hand it does welcome the overthrow of the Chang Myeon Clique, while at the same time it condemns initiators and leading politicians behind the military coup as reactionary. Nevertheless the statement still has lines like the following: “ […] The soldiers, privates, officers, and generals of the South Korean defense forces, who were rising up to stage a military coup, have to reject maneuvers by those who violate their [the defense forces'] demands and attempt to sell out the national interests. They immediately must begin patriotic actions and stand side by side with the people […].”Furthermore: “ […] Since the treasonous Chang Myeon Clique has been finished, it is imperative today to decisively strike against interference and cabals, if one wants to move the currently existing situation in South Korea towards a path of preserving the interests of the fatherland and the nation […].”In light of the openly anti-communist demonstrations held yesterday in Seoul this statement by ZTAK is unsatisfactory. It is still lacking a clear assessment of this reactionary military coup.The diplomatic representatives of socialist countries [in Pyongyang] think the Korean comrades allowed themselves to get confused through the initial statement from American representatives; and also through the fact that students and other circles initially welcomed this military coup out of excitement about the overthrow of Chang Myeon. For the Korean comrades, the military coup came as surprising as the April events last year [1960]. Although this [ZTAK] statement comes out against the reactionary and counterrevolutionary leaders of the coup, in our opinion it is falling short of providing a correct assessment. It fails to point at the enormous danger created by this military coup.Full text of the statement will be sent with next courier.Schneidewind ","['Schneidewind, Kurt']","['Elections--Korea', 'Protest movements--Korea (South)', 'Korean reunification question (1945- )', 'Korea (North)--Foreign relations--Korea (South)', 'Civil-military relations--Korea (South)', 'Korea (South)--History--May Revolution, 1961']"
167,Telegram from Pyongyang,19611201,"Telegram from Pyongyang received 1 Dec. 1961 On the 28 November, Albanian students studying at Kim Il Sung University in Pyongyang held a party on the occasion of the Albanian state holiday. During the party, they propagated the position of the Albanian leadership and its destructive line. Besides the Korean students, Chinese and Vietnamese students also took part. According to the Hungarian comrades, the refreshments were provided by the Chinese embassy. The most important guest at the party was Kim Il Sung's son, who is a student at Kim Il Sung University and has been reportedly maintaining very close friendly relations with the Albanian students for some time. He has been inviting them home to meet his family. Before their state holiday, the Albanian students, after lengthy discussions with the Korean comrades, succeeded in securing permission to hang portraits of Stalin in their rooms. After the initial animosity against Albanian students that began to be apparent among Korean students after the 22nd Congress, when the latter became acquainted with the materials of the congress in Russian, the Albanian students launched a major initiative to gain the sympathy of both Korean students and students from other countries. A great help to them was precisely Kim Il Sung's son, who as early as the time of the Albanians' arrival in the DPRK headed the welcoming committee and organized a warm welcome for them. Among the students of the university, Kim Il Sung's son has been enjoying great respect and has tremendous influence on their thinking.

I am relaying the information presented today by Blas Roca2 and Emilio Aragonés [Navarro]3 (secretary of the ORI [Organizaciones Revolucionarias Intergradas4] to the heads of the diplomatic posts of the countries of the socialist camp. They asked that we relay this information to the central committees of [our] parties.On the 22nd of this month, the national leadership of the ORI made a decision to exclude Anibal Escalante from the leadership of the ORI. A. E. remains a member of the ORI, but he’s been removed from all the leadership positions.[They said that the] motives [for the removal of Anibal Escalante were as follows]: as an organizational secretary of the ORI, A. E. used brutal and arbitrary methods of management, as well as intrigues aimed at concentrating control in his hands over the party and national apparatus. He used these methods towards other comrades regardless of their previous organizational membership [that is, whether they belonged to the former Popular Socialist Party or the “26th of July Movement”]. He managed to [take] control of a series of ministries, among others, the Ministry of Internal Affairs; he undertook the steps in order to control the military cadres. A. E.’s arbitrary behavior could be already be detected in the 1940s, when he served in the leadership of the Popular Socialist Party, and later [when he was active in] the underground and [finally] after the collapse of the [Fulgencio Batista]5 dictatorship. Various circumstances did not allow for putting an end to [Escalante’s behavior] during these different periods.The discussion related to the activities of A. E. began in February of this year under the older leadership. The resolution from the 22nd of this month was adopted without the participation of the new members of the current leadership (which was approved on the 8th of this month – see our Claris6 54), all of who did not participate in the previous phase of the discussion. [The resolution] will be presented to the public by Fidel [Castro]. The discussion focused only on [issues such as Escalante’s] work methods and organizational matters, and not on the ideological issues. The [Cuban] leadership will, unconditionally, adopt methods of collective leadership. They will hold meetings once a week under the current composition (24 members). The secretariat meets daily regarding [making] current decisions. They accelerated the process of creating the Revolutionary Party Cells (the equivalent of our POP [Basic Party Organizations]). They have not openly carried out their activities everywhere until now; the[se] activities were predominant in workplaces, especially among the management and administration. The membership selection to the Revolutionary Party Cells will be carried out strictly by taking political and moral aspects into consideration. The party will be composed of the cadres and it should count no more than 10 thousand members. The [party] congress will take place no earlier than at the end of the year.There will be changes in the positions of provincial committee secretaries in four provinces (there are six provinces overall [in Cuba]). [These changes] are not connected with the activities of A. E., and they are a result of the weaknesses [exhibited by] some of the current secretaries.In order to streamline [the work of] some departments, there will be some changes in the leadership. The most significant change pertains to the position of the minister of internal trade, because the poor organizational situation in the area of distribution. These changes do not have any political background (see our Claris 69 – [Manuel] Luzardo – from the former Popular Socialist Party, Celia Sanchez – Fidel’s secretary until now).There is going to be a change regarding the position of the head of the Security Department in the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Brahantes is the one who is holding this position; he is a secretary and Fidel’s aide.II. In our Claris 67, we have already reported that the members of the “26th of July Movement”7 are numerically predominant in the secretariat and the commission. The only one from the former Popular Socialist Party8 who is currently a member of the secretariat is Blas Roca (the function of the organizational secretary is fully held by [Emilio] Aragones). As far as the organizational commission, only Luzardo remains [as the member of the former Popular Socialist Party]), and L. Pena holds a position in the syndical commission. III. The information, which I presented in the first point of this cable, was relayed separately and individually to the ambassadors from the USSR, the PRC, and Albania, all of whom were not invited to the general meeting [of socialist countries]. [The North] Korean [ambassador] sent his secretary even though he attended a party soon before the meeting. The charge d’affaires represented the [North] Vietnamese embassy.IV. Anibal Escalante – an old member of the leadership of the Popular Socialist Party and its long-time organizational secretary. He worked for the Comintern and represented the Popular Socialist Party at the conference of 81 [communist and workers’] parties.9 After the formation of the ORI, he served as the organizational secretary. He joined the new leadership of the ORI that was approved on the 8th of this month.[1] Poland’s Ambassador to Cuba (1961-1965).[2] Blas Roca (1908 – 1987), a leading theoretician of the Cuban Revolution and the leader of the former Popular Socialist Party.[3] Emilio Aragonés Navarro (1928 – 2007), one of the original members of the 26th of July Movement; friends with Ernesto “Che” Guevara.[4] Organizaciones Revolucionarias Integradas was formed in July 1961 following the Cuban Revolution and the fall of the Fulgencio Batista regime. The ORI was comprised of the members of the revolutionary organization called the “26th of July Movement” of Fidel Castro, the Popular Socialist Party of Blas Roca, and the Revolutionary Directorate of March 13th of Faure Chomón Mediavilla. On March 26, 1962, the ORI was transformed into Partido Unido de la Revolución Socialista de Cuba (PURSC). In 1965, the PURSC was transformed into the Partido Comunista de Cuba (PCC) which exists to this day.[5] Fulgencio Batista y Zaldívar (1901-1973) served as Cuba’s president twice: 1940 – 1944 and 1952 – 1959.[6] Claris is an embassy/consular letter reporting on information included in the press.[7] “The 26th of July Movement” – movement led by Fidel Castro that overthrew the regime of Fulgencio Batista in Cuba in 1959. After Castro’s victory, the movement was integrated into the Organizaciones Revolucionarias Integradas (ORI) in 1961.[8] The Popular Socialist Party (Partido Socialista Popular) was formed in 1925 by a group including Blas Roca, Anibal Escalante, Fabio Grobart, and Julion Antonio Mella. It was later merged into the Integrated Revolutionary Organizations (ORI), the precursor of the current Communist Party of Cuba.[9] The November 1960 Conference of the Representatives of the Communist and Workers’ Parties was attended by delegations from 81 countries and took place in Moscow.","['Jelen, Bolesław']","['Communist parties--Latin America', 'Cuba--Foreign relations--Latin America']"
170,Telegram from Czech Embassy in Pyongyang to Foreign Ministry,19630827,"Telegram from Pyongyang Arrived: 8/27/63 4 : 00 pmProcessed: 8/28/63 8 : 00 amIssued: 8/28/63 8 : 30 amFurther information from BodnerashHaving returned from the PRC with a delegation headed by Choe Yong-geon [Choe Yong Gon], minister Pak Seong-cheol [Pak Song Chol] told Bodnerash that Chinese were showing them only arms factories (10plants). They were boasting that they make 96.5 % of arms themselves. (According to Pak Seong-cheol, common types of weaponry, often obsolete). There were also remarks that the DPRK shares 800 km border with the PRC while only several tens of km with the USSR, and that is even inaccessible mountains or sunken in the sea. Pak Seong-cheol (known for his pro-Chinese bias) was apparently disillusioned and perhaps even intimidated. Bodnerash then expressed his opinion about the PRC leadership – allegedly a band of swindlers deserving only contempt. They have nothing in common not only with Marxism but with conduct of honest people either. There is no dirty trick too low for them. Their goal is world dominance that they expect to achieve with the help of nuclear weapons. That is allegedly the root of their hatred towards the USSR. He says he admires Khrushchev because he has so much patience when dealing with them. “As long as the current leadership of China is at the helm, do not expect it to be any different.” Further details about the visit with KIS (Kim Il Sung): KIS is said to be very upset, especially with the Chinese but also with the USSR. He blames his attitude towards the both on a major disappointment he experienced as early as 1951. While he allegedly went “with a hat in his hand like a beggar” to all our countries and asked for help with building the country, a conspiracy was set up in the DPRK with the help of some high officials of the USSR and the PRC. He allegedly swore that he would never again go begging. The Korean people can lead their country from poverty with their own efforts. Further, he repeated the already relayed facts. Again about KIS, that he is very wise, does not spare his health, travels around the country, directs, helps, gives advice. Supposedly, it is not right to talk about a cult. It is supposedly necessary to see that at stake is Asia that is just awakening from deep feudalism. “Don’t be surprised he is a god for the Korean people; he lead the people from terrible humiliation and oppression.” About the Korean press: That, he says, is irrelevant; it only matters what KIS says.About celebrations of the 15th anniversary of founding of the DPRK: Huge celebrations whose objective supposedly was to strengthen people’s confidence in their own capabilities, and to give them courage for further building. About high participation of foreigners: To show the South Korean people the firm international position of the DPRK, and to neutralize numerous proclamations of Park Chung Hee and other representatives of the military junta in SK that only they are internationally recognized. Supposedly, there is no need to exaggerate participation of Liu Shaoqi. KIS will allegedly be sick again and will not take part. All will happen at the level of Choe Yong-geon. People will supposedly be able to understand the absence of KIS. About the latest attacks of the KWP against the Yugoslavian revisionism: Bodnerash fully agrees with the KWP. A correction of the Moscow declaration hasn’t been done, and Tito did not change in any way either. Allegedly, he knows Tito very well and does not believe he will change. In conclusion he appealed that now an agreement and assignment of tasks among our Embassies is necessary, how to isolate the DPRK from Chinese influence as much as possible, and to strengthen the DPRK’s position in our camp. He emphasized namely the economic aid from China and excursions of delegations of the DPRK professionals to the PRR. He also informed that Korean students are again enrolling in the PRR’s universities this year.

In this respect, the Cuban government appointed the former Cuban press correspondent who had spent his previous two years on the freed territories in South Vietnam.Nguyen Long mentioned that in case other countries were interested to send diplomatic delegates or press correspondents to the freed territories in South Vietnam, the NLF would insure, to the best of its abilities, the necessary conditions in which they can pursue their activities. In reply to a question asked by A. I. Lazar, the Vietnamese diplomat said that the North Koreans were aware of this offer from the NLF but so far it had not manifested its wish to send a permanent delegate to the NLF. Actually, Nguyen Long said, the North Koreans had plenty of people active in South Vietnam. He added that “They are active in those areas where South Korean troops are operating, so as to study their fighting tactics, techniques combat readiness and the morale of the South Korean Army, and to use propaganda against the South Koreans.” Nguyen Long said that the DPRK was planning to send even more people to South Vietnam but they were confronted with language difficulties, as they don’t speak Vietnamese.The activity of these North Koreans operating in South Vietnam is coordinated by a member of the North Korean embassy in Hanoi, who has strong ties with the NLF representatives in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

172,"Telegram from Pyongyang to Bucharest, TOP SECRET, No. 76.012, Urgent",19680122,"On January 22, 1968, a Seoul radio station continuously broadcasted special news bulletins on the armed clash that took place on the outskirts of Seoul on January 21 around 10:00 pm between the city police and ‘an armed group of diversionists and spies from North Korea’ (more than 30 people).According to the information provided by the radio station, the clash in question, which is the first attempt on behalf of elements from the North to attack premises in the South Korean capital, resulted in the death and injury of several South Korean civilians and policemen. For the North Korean side, as of now, five people were killed, two were captured alive, and the rest of the group withdrew to the North. The South Koreans continued to pursue them, but they couldn’t find anything more than abandoned weapons and military equipment.The South Koreans declared an emergency situation in Seoul and the surrounding areas, forbidding movement [of citizens] during the night and taking measures to prevent the infiltration of new elements [from North Korea]. According to the testimony of one of the North Koreans who was captured alive, the purpose of the incursion was to attack the presidential palace in Seoul and to shoot President Park Chung Hee. In the DPRK, the 024 Special Unit is currently preparing eight more groups of 300 people each to deploy in guerilla fights against South Korea. The prisoner declared that the military group he was a member of crossed the border on January 17 and was supposed to return [to North Korea] via the same path.In our opinion, although the purported aim of this incursion in Seoul seems unlikely to us, we believe that this action was incredibly daring and narrow-minded. This attempt to attack a location in Seoul represents a seriously alarming sign about the implementation of the hard line [policy] promoted by the DPRK, which seeks to force and hasten a forthcoming great revolutionary event—the unification of the country through the use of force.We believe that this action, which created panic and tension in South Korea (they convened a special parliamentary session on January 30), will only aggravate the situation in Korea and will give rise to new conflicts between the two sides.We believe that the North Koreans will give a different interpretation of this action, denying their involvement in this event and will probably explain this violent act as a manifestation of the increased revolutionary spirit of South Korean masses against the regime of Park Chung Hee.Signed: N.

173,"Telegram from Pyongyang to Bucharest, TOP SECRET, No. 76.013, Flash",19680124,"1. On January 24, propaganda organizations in the DPRK issued elaborate news bulletins with regard to the actions undertaken by the armed groups who are dealing blows to the American and South Korean units in the ROK.According to the South Koreans, South Korean units and American troops are pursuing the North Korean group which initiated the attack on January 21 in Seoul and which is currently retreating towards the DPRK. Out of the 31 members of the group, 15 people were shot in isolated clashes with the South Koreans and one was taken prisoner.Judging from the way the North Korean press is presenting the situation in the ROK, we realize that they are exaggerating a great deal and they purposely distort the truth so as to create the impression of a truly revolutionary state of mind. Although news reports are also concerned with the twentieth anniversary of the creation of the DPRK Army, the North Korean press is in the midst of an intense campaign against the Americans and the South Koreans. Scenes from the fighting during the war and the liberation of Seoul in 1950 cover the pages of North Korean newspapers almost entirely.2. At the same time, it was announced that on January 22 an American military ship was captured [by the North Koreans] in the waters of Wonsan Harbor (it was not specified whether in the territorial waters of Wonsan—our note).3. The South Korean radio station announced that the ship in question, weighing 906 tons and having a crew of 83 people, was captured from international waters and forced to enter Wonsan Harbor. This action was meant to make the emerging situation [on the peninsula] even more tense; the state of the South Korean army and fleet was changed to ‘fighting’ mode, and the American aircraft carrier Enterprise departed from the Japanese port Sasebo and will be stationed in the waters in front of Wonsan harbor in the DPRK.4. Judging from the things we’ve remarked upon recently, over the last three days the North Koreans have established many military checkpoints; they carry out daytime and nighttime raids; throughout the city there are more and more armed groups of civilians (even 4 to 5 people); the nightshift guards for embassies have doubled; and an increasing number of policemen are posted in front of embassies. This explains the recently enforced prohibition on foreigners traveling outside of Pyongyang.5. We believe that the provocations which have emerged recently are attributable to the North Koreans entirely and in this way they put into practice the motto: ‘let us be ready and take initiative to welcome the forthcoming great revolutionary event of the reunification of the motherland.’Although the North Koreans are currently testing the nerves and feeling out the attitudes of all elements in South Korea, including the US, towards a potential large-scale military confrontation, we believe it is not impossible that the aggravated situation in South Korea will lead to the resumption of hostilities (stopped in 1953).Signed: N.

174,"Telegram from Pyongyang to Bucharest, TOP SECRET, No: 75.015, Flash",19680124,"On January 24 at 9:00 pm, Kim Jaebong, the DPRK Deputy Foreign Minister, summoned the chiefs of all diplomatic missions from socialist countries accredited to Pyongyang and the representative of the National Liberation Front (NLF) from South Vietnam to the North Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs to inform them of the capture of the American military ship USS Pueblo weighing 1000 tons by the North Korean coastguard after [the ship] ventured deep into North Korean waters. The Deputy Foreign Minister explained that the ship was observed at a distance of 10 miles away from the coast and was captured after it advanced up to 7.6 miles away from the coast in the waters of the bay formed by the Hodo Peninsula and the Yeodo Island.Kim Jaebong informed the diplomats that the ship was meant exclusively for intelligence gathering (focusing in this case on the military bases on the coast), having, at the same time, a great quantity of arms on board. The crew numbered 83 people, of whom six were officers, 75 were sailors, and two were civilian technicians. One member of the crew died following fire exchanges, which resulted from the crew resisting measures undertaken by the North Korean military; three people were injured, one of whom was gravely injured.Judging this provocative act directed at gathering intelligence as the most outrageous one [committed by the United States] since signing the Armistice [in 1953], the Deputy Foreign Minister asked the chiefs of diplomatic missions to report back to their governments on this new and serious provocative action undertaken by the American imperialists and expressed his conviction that the governments [of socialist countries] would take the appropriate actions and vehemently condemn these pirate-like acts.He laconically added that it was likely for the situation to become worse because the American imperialists had already deployed an important unit from the Seventh Fleet to the seas neighboring the DPRK.Answering the questions of certain ambassadors, Kim Jaebong declared that although the DPRK had not publicly announced the width of its territorial waters, he said, for the personal use of those present, that the DPRK had a territorial waters width of 12 miles.He added that his government was going to release a declaration on this matter.Judging from the sources of the Czechoslovak Embassy, which was promptly informed by its delegation in the Armistice Commission, we know that the USS Pueblo was captured by the North Korean coastguard when it was 16 miles away from the DPRK shore, while press agencies stated that the ship had been 25 miles away from the shore when it was captured.We believe that, owing to the uncertainty around the conditions in which the incident took place, it is not advisable for us to take any particular measures.

175,"Telegram from Pyongyang to Bucharest, TOP SECRET, No. 76.017, Flash",19680125,"On January 24, Aurelian Lazar had a discussion with S. Golosov, Second Secretary of the Soviet Embassy in Pyongyang, during which Golosov told Lazar that Soviet diplomats were extremely worried with respect to the unrestrained actions undertaken by the DPRK against the ROK (the January 21 attack in Seoul) and against the USA, manifested in the capturing of the military vessel AGER-2 [the USS Pueblo]. The Soviet diplomat pointed out that if the DPRK continued to undertake such initiatives to speed up the reunification of the country, it would be possible for the Soviets to be presented with a fait accompli in the sense of the resumption of an all-out war.S. Golosov said: ‘the North Koreans know the unfavorable position of the USSR towards the intentions and the tendencies to hasten reunification through the use of force and therefore we are afraid that we will not be consulted; and this situation is caused by the fact that we do not know the dynamics of Sino-Korean relations and the attitude of the People’s Republic of China towards the Korean issue, particularly in its recent form shaped by the DPRK [since the January 21 attack].’ Lastly, the Soviet diplomat added that the North Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been trying, at all levels, to find out the answer to one pressing question: ‘Whether the USSR will help the DPRK and in what form in the case of the resumption of an all-out war on the Korean Peninsula.’ ‘When we try to moderate this warmongering state of mind,’ Golosov added, ‘on many occasions, our position is not taken into account.’The Soviet diplomat pointed out that there is a possibility that the North Koreans, taking advantage of the fact that the USA does not intend to get involved in a new conflict in Korea, are using the tense situation to make clear some aspects of the KWP’s [Korean Workers’ Party’s] internal and external policies, and intentionally caused the incidents on January 21 and January 22.Commenting on the article written by Paul de Groot and published in the Korean press on January 17 and January 18, Golosov described it as being utterly anti-Soviet and that its publication represents a negative answer given to the organizers of the Consultative Meeting in Budapest in February [1968]. The publication of this article, the Soviet diplomat added, ‘strengthens our opinion that Soviet-Korean bilateral relations, except for economic relations, which the North Koreans are keenly interested in, have started to deteriorate. (our note—Golosov hinted at the fact that the Soviet government might have been too optimistic to think that an intensification of economic aid would make the North Koreans accept the political conditions which came with it).On a different topic, the Soviet diplomat showed us that recently elements which the [North Korean] security apparatus could not trust have been removed from the city of Pyongyang. Golosov said that he knew for a fact that Kim Il Sung had left Pyongyang for the countryside a while ago (at least a few weeks).With respect to a question from the Romanian diplomat about the urgent departure to Moscow of the Soviet Ambassador to Pyongyang ten days ago, the Soviet diplomat said that his ambassador was supposed to return to his post rather quickly but, given the recent events in Korea, his return was postponed by another week.In my opinion, the Soviet Ambassador to Pyongyang was invited to go back to Moscow to give an explanation on the recent events in Korea and the likely outcomes [of these events].Also, in my opinion, the Soviet Ambassador to Pyongyang provided misguided information to his government about the situation in Korea, in the sense of an exceedingly optimistic perspective and in total contradiction with the real situation and the intentions of the DPRK leadership with respect to the reunification of the country.Signed: N.

At the meeting of the NNSC [Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission] in Panmunjeom on January 24, attended by Polish representatives, the North Koreans and the Americans, contrary to their usual hardline and rude postures, exchanged their views in an extremely calm atmosphere, but with resoluteness, which denotes the great caution with which they are handling the situation. The North Koreans refused to discuss the January 21 incident, arguing that it cannot be the subject of the Armistice Commission, given that it was an act of South Korean patriots. As for the capture of the American ship, the North Koreans claim that it [the USS Pueblo] violated their territorial waters and it is therefore its prisoner, together with its entire crew.2. The Polish representatives at Panmunjeom were surprised at the promptness of the DPRK’s acceptance of the meeting proposed by the Americans to discuss the incidents on January 21 and January 22.

The Polish diplomat said that he had been informed that from January 10 to January 12 North Korean troops and peasant-worker guards conducted joint military exercises in the south of the DPRK. The senior leadership was satisfied with the outcomes of these exercises. Moreover, he pointed out that during the evenings of January 22 and January 23, several military units and workers’ guards departed from the Pyongyang railway station.4.

Golub, the Ambassador of Czechoslovakia to Pyongyang, on January 29, we gathered that a dialogue between the representatives of the DPRK and American envoys took place and is expected to continue.With the help of the four neutral generals, Freeman, the Chief of Staff of the Third American Army stationed in South Korea, warned the head of the North Korean delegation at the Armistice Commission that in the event North Korea opened fire on South Korea, the armed forces of the United States would use the most modern means and weapons available, including the nuclear bomb, against the North Korean people. The document released by the United States asks the North Koreans for detailed information about the health of the USS Pueblo crew members.General Pak Jeong-guk answered both verbally and in writing that these threats did not intimidate the Korean people. He then discussed the health of the USS Pueblo crew members, warning that if the US tried to liberate the 83 crew members by force, they would only retrieve their corpses. According to Golub, it is promising that a dialogue on this issue began, even though the parties involved are using very harsh language.Based on the briefings received today from the general in Panmunjeom, the neutral parties believe that the current situation is extremely dangerous. Golub informed us about some of the latest developments, which only make the current situation worse; he told us that the entire South Korean army was carrying out drills and preparations in response to the new and exceptional state of affairs, under the command of General [Charles H.] Bonesteel; six additional mining ships and torpedo boats were moving towards the DPRK waters; and two Soviet ships were stationed in the vicinity of the American carrier USS Enterprise, to monitor its activity.It is foreseeable that, in the future, more ships from the Soviet Pacific fleet will move to this area.Golub remarked that among the latest developments was the fact that members of the North Korean military delegation in Panmunjeom started to describe the USS Pueblo crew members as ‘prisoners of war,’ which means that the North Koreans did not intend to bring them before court.Describing the continuation of diplomatic activity to solve the conflict as a positive development, the Czechoslovakian diplomat mentioned that South Korea had recently invited U Thant to Seoul to show him the ‘revolutionary circumstances’ which the North keeps touting. At the same time, he pointed out the fact that Robert Kennedy advised President Johnson to urgently explore the possibility of signing a bilateral treaty with the Soviets to refrain from intervening in the case of a war in Korea, based on the legal commitments that the two countries have towards North Korea and South Korea, respectively.M. Golub pointed out that only the Soviet Union would have the influence over the DPRK to ameliorate the situation, since it is beyond any doubt that the Chinese would push the events towards a military conflict.Signed: N.

Lazar about the following:1. On two different occasions, the Soviet Chargé d'affaires visited Pak Seong-cheol, the Foreign Minister of the DPRK, to inform him about the US proposal for the USSR to mediate the USS Pueblo incident and about the Soviet refusal to do so. Pak Seong-cheol appreciated the position of the Soviets, underlining that it proved [the Soviet Union] respected the sovereignty of the DPRK.Our opinion is that, through the two meetings with the Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Soviets probed the position of the North Koreans towards the incident and towards the prospects of resolving the situation.2. Tsvetkov said that on January 27 the Soviet Ambassador to Pyongyang returned to his post, and that he would be ready to take action to moderate the Korean leadership, bringing it back with its feet on the ground, but he would not act until the position of the People’s Republic of China was known (maybe it will be too late—our note). ‘We believe that it is not impossible that behind the Koreans stand the Chinese, and if Soviet advice runs against the Korean line, that may bring about the exact opposite outcome from what we envision,’ said the Soviet diplomat.The fact that the Soviet Ambassador returned to Pyongyang on a special plane makes us think that he did not come back alone, but together with several other Soviet leaders, to discuss the current situation with the Korean leadership.3. The Soviet diplomat showed that the Soviet air fleet in the Pacific was ordered to move close to the military ships deployed by the US from its Seventh Fleet in the Sea of Japan.4. With respect to the internal situation, Tsvetkov said that Soviet diplomats thought that the DPRK had secretly called for general mobilization and that they obtained reliable information that large troop movements were being moved towards the southern and the eastern borders.Signed: N.

I am copying here the entire account of their position on the USS Pueblo incident.‘I would like to talk about the violation of our territorial waters by the armed espionage vessel and the counter-measures we took to defend ourselves.‘We are not trying to inflate this matter but the American imperialists are trying to use this incident to launch a larger-scale military operation against our country and they seek to aggravate the situation even more.‘No matter when and where these American imperialists try [to attack us], our people will deal them a powerful blow. However, we do not believe that the USS Pueblo incident provides a good enough reason to go to war and therefore we are trying to solve the matter peacefully.‘However, if the Americans threaten us, the matter will not be solved.‘In order to solve all problems appropriately, the Americans should put an end to all threats and military blackmail against us, and they should do this not through words but with actions.‘We are not paying attention to empty words and articles written by journalists.‘Moreover, if the American imperialists want to solve this matter peacefully, they would have to turn the circumstances back to how they were before the occurrence of this incident.‘Therefore, the nuclear carrier and all other ships and military troops should be withdrawn to prevent the deterioration of the situation.‘Moreover, the American imperialists demand that we apologize to them for this incident and that we pay damages and return everything unconditionally.‘We will not enter negotiations with them under these conditions and we will not kneel down when confronted with such threats. We are determined to fight if we need to fight.‘Under these circumstances we would like to thank socialist governments for their support.‘You, the Romanians, have also helped us tremendously and we are certain that you will help us with these matters even more in the future.‘In the given circumstances, we need to strengthen our unity with socialist countries, with the Soviet Union, with China, with all communist countries, with all anti-imperialist countries, so as to fight adamantly against imperialists and reactionaries.’2. With respect to the international meeting of communist and workers’ parties, the basic position of the Korean comrades is in essence identical with ours.They mentioned that they made their position known, as clearly as possible, to the Soviets.With respect to the meeting in Budapest, they said:‘We were not informed nor consulted in advance on this matter either and we do not really know how the meeting was convened. We have a tense situation here now, we are faced with lots of complicated problems, so we couldn’t have really extended talks within our leadership circles and we did not take a decision yet, but we hope to discuss this matter later on and decide.‘We understand the position of the Romanian Communist Party, we do not have a different position on this and we do not have any objection on the participation or the non-participation of certain parties to this meeting.’3.

185,"Telegram from Pyongyang to Bucharest, TOP SECRET, No. 76.033, Urgent",19680205,"On February 5, A. Lazar received T. Surgov, Second Secretary of the Bulgarian Embassy to Pyongyang. Surgov wanted to know if, during the visit of comrade Gheorghe Apostol, the North Koreans had mentioned any details about their participation in the international meeting in Budapest, whether they had brought up the issue of how to solve the USS Pueblo incident, and whether the North Korean leadership had given us any hints about when reunification would take place.A. Lazar said that he had not attended the discussions of the two delegations, but afterwards, he had noticed that the Korean Workers’ Party had not taken a firm decision with respect to its participation in the international meeting in Budapest. With respect to the other issues raised by Surgov, the Romanian diplomat said that they had not been discussed in detail and that he could not decipher the intentions of the North Koreans as these issues were mentioned in passing.Surgov said that he raised the first question because Soviet and Czech diplomats in Pyongyang were spreading the rumor that the delegation of the Romanian Communist Party tried to influence the leadership of the Korean Workers’ Party to take part in the international conference in Budapest and to adopt a similar position to its own. A. Lazar said that the Romanian Communist Party had been consulting and would continue to do so with all parties on the main problems of common interest and on the matters of the international communist movement and it would be wrong to think that this activity was an attempt to exert influence. A. Lazar said that if the Soviets, or any other [party], believe that the Korean Workers’ Party can be convinced to take part in the conference or dissuaded from doing so, they should carry out this kind of action themselves, as the organizers of this conference in Budapest.On a different matter, the Bulgarian diplomat said that T. [Todor] Zhivkov cancelled his visit to Havana, arguing that he could not have subscribed to the claims of the Cuban leadership with respect to the anti-party Soviet cliques which had been discovered and unmasked recently within the Communist Party of Cuba.Signed: N.

186,"Telegram from Pyongyang to Bucharest, TOP SECRET, No. 76.035, Urgent",19680207,"With respect to the secret negotiations which are currently taking place in Panmunjeom between the North Koreans and the Americans on the USS Pueblo military vessel seized by the DPRK on January 23, we would like to inform you about the following matters:The central press agencies released a brief statement revealing that, due to the persistent requests of the Americans, the North Koreans have agreed to enter into talks at Panmunjeom on the USS Pueblo incident.We know that the Koreans are usually extremely calm in their discussions and they are trying to drag their feet as much as possible to extend the length of these talks. One of the signs of the DPRK’s malleability is the fact that on February 6 it returned the bodies of the two USS Pueblo crew members who died during the incident while also expressing its intent to release the two or three wounded members of the crew.As far as we know from what the Press Director of the DPRK Ministry of Foreign Affairs told us on February 6, the Americans are searching for the best possible pretense to excuse themselves in front of the North Korean authorities and international public opinion, putting all the blame on the USS Pueblo commander who ‘lacked the consent of his superiors and, acting upon his own judgment, violated the territorial waters of the DPRK.’The fact that the Americans started their secret talks with the DPRK and that they are strictly discussing the USS Pueblo incident without linking it to the incidents in South Korea (the infiltration from the North on January 21), together with the tendency of the Americans to admit their guilt in one way or another in front of the North Koreans, gave rise in South Korea to the biggest repulsion towards the United States of America in the last twenty years.The South Korean authorities and all parties and organizations in South Korea laid official complaints and openly condemned the meek attitude of the United States, which is manifested in their willingness to enter secret talks with the DPRK on the USS Pueblo incident.Over the last few days, intense anti-American demonstrations have taken place in Seoul and in all urban centers in South Korea, underlining the dissatisfaction with the secret negotiations in Panmunjeom and asking Park Chung Hee’s government to revisit its position vis-à-vis the United States of America (which is discounting South Korea’s ability to pursue its own interests); in order to enhance its self-defense capabilities (given that the United States of America is no longer offering the appropriate guarantees), it was asked to withdraw South Korean troops from South Vietnam, to take serious measures to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future, etc. Under these circumstances, it has become even more obvious why the DPRK is extending its negotiations with the United States as much as possible.The diplomatic corps in Pyongyang believes that the South Koreans are intensifying this anti-American campaign so that after solving the USS Pueblo incident, they will be able to obtain more substantial military aid from the US.We think that irrespective of the means the US will use to draw closer to South Korea, the prestige and reputation of the Americans in the eyes of the South Korean people has been seriously undermined. In this respect, we take into account the fact that the United States accepted to sit down and talk to the DPRK, to whom they will apologize, as well as the fact that the majority of the infiltrations from the North are being carried out through the perimeter guarded by the American Second division, which has generated a lot of mistrust in the way the US is ensuring South Korea’s security.Due to the instability, confusion, and dwindling trust of the support offered by the US, South Korea adopted a series of serious measures to strengthen its self-defense capabilities. Thus, President Park Chung Hee ordered the mobilization of 2.5 million people on February 7, pausing all retirements in the armed forces and creating armed self-defense units (troops) in every large village.",[],"['Pueblo Incident, 1968', 'Korea (North)--Foreign relations--United States', 'Korea (South)--Foreign relations--United States', 'Korea (South)--Politics and government', 'Korea (South)--Military relations--United States']"

189,"Telegram from Pyongyang to Bucharest, TOP SECRET, No. 76.044, Regular",19680216,"Following the events in Seoul on January 21 and the USS Pueblo incident [on January 23], one can notice a conspicuous cold attitude on behalf of the Vietnamese diplomats (from the delegation of the National Liberation Front, NLF, and from the Embassy of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam) toward the North Korean comrades.In a recent discussion between the Romanian Ambassador and Vu Ngoc Ho, the representative of the NLF in Pyongyang, the latter stated with unrestrained anxiety that the North Koreans, in an attempt to underline the alleged similarity between the situation in South Korea and that in South Vietnam, affirmed that just like the revolution in South Vietnam cannot endure for too long without the help of North Vietnam, so the revolution in South Korean needs the help of North Korea.This uninspired comparison referring to the revolutionary situation in the southern parts of the two countries was sensitive for the Vietnamese diplomats, because, according to the Czech Ambassador, they were the ones to approach this issue openly in many conversations with members of other socialist diplomatic missions in Pyongyang.We believe that there are other factors contributing to this deterioration [of relations between the Vietnamese and the North Koreans], namely the USS Pueblo incident and the incident in Seoul, through which the North Koreans muted any similarity of the events in Vietnam, which took place at the same time, attracting the attention of the international public opinion on contingent actions without any prospects and without an adequate revolutionary basis (in South Korea—our note).On the occasion of the Army Day Anniversary in North Korea, the two Vietnamese delegations sent only staff at the level of ‘First Secretary’ to the many activities organized by the North Koreans (the Ambassador invoked health problems and the NLF representative left Pyongyang before February 8).Signed: N.

190,"Telegram from Pyongyang to Bucharest, TOP SECRET, No. 76.046, Urgent",19680219,"We would like to draw your attention to the fact that, over the past few days, war preparations have intensified in both Koreas. People in South Korea are fearfully talking about the massive concentration of North Korean troops in the vicinity of the demilitarized zone, so as to carry out a surprise attack, while the North keeps stressing the news about how the United States and the South Korean authorities are ready to unleash a new war on the DPRK.On both sides, military provocations continue in the vicinity of the 38th parallel, with increased intensity and frequency, leading to frequent meetings of the Military Armistice Commission in Panmunjeom. In an interview granted to the Korean Central News Agency (ACTC) on February 17, Pak Seongcheol, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, underlined that the situation in Korea is extremely tense; that the Americans and Park Chung Hee are the only ones to blame in case of a resumption of the war in Korea, given the intensity of their aggressive provocations; that any reprisals toward the USS Pueblo incident from the United States and South Korea will trigger the resumption of war; that the outbreak of war and its absence depends entirely on the United States and South Korea, etc.We also noticed that both the radio channels and the press are increasingly using terms like: ‘we are awaiting the order of our leader to liberate South Korea,’ ‘we are ready for the liberation of the South.’ North Korean categorical statements have multiplied: ‘we will respond to retaliation with retaliation;’ ‘we will respond to war with war,’ etc.Judging from the current situation, we believe that these intense preparations and massive movements of North Korean troops of all categories to near the demilitarized zone are not so much dictated by self-defense concerns but by the intentions of the DPRK to launch a surprise attack to unify the country, by capitalizing on an incident caused by the South and on the current circumstances in Vietnam, where the United States finds itself in an unfavorable situation.We believe the North Korean authorities want to take advantage of the chaos and disorder existing in the South and not give the South enough time for mobilization, for physical and psychological preparations, as well as for the deployment of the latest technologies recently promised by the United States to South Korea. They [the North Koreans] also do not want to miss this auspicious moment created by the situation in Vietnam. Given the fact that the DPRK leadership cannot conceive of the reunification of the country without the use of force, we believe that the beginning of the unification depends on finding the most propitious moment, by all means not after solving the Vietnamese conflict, the USS Pueblo incident, or after the restoration and strengthening of the South Koreans’ fighting capacity.Signed: N.

191,"Telegram from Pyongyang to Bucharest, TOP SECRET, No. 76.047, Regular",19680219,"I would like to convey the following notes I took during my February 19 conversation with Le Thet Hung, the Ambassador of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to Pyongyang:1. Two offensives are being carried out by the forces of the National Liberation Front in South Vietnam and are part of a tactical cycle which aims to continue the fight and gain the initiative while expanding the battlefield.The main purpose of these large-scale offensive actions is to shatter to the ground the regime in Saigon and thus rally the entire people to take up arms, to counter all the actions of the Saigon army, to divide it and isolate it from the American troops.Secondly, [the aim is to] simultaneously attack all American bases and inflict severe damages in terms of personnel, materiel, and military equipment; to create even more confusion; to disrupt the ranks of the American military and of its satellites; and to weaken their morale, which is already very low anyway.These offensives offer the opportunity to fully resupply the troops in South Vietnam with weapons and ammunition, which are so needed to maintain and further the successes they achieved so far.2. According to the Vietnamese diplomat, the United States of America will not dare and will not be able to use tactical nuclear weapons in South Vietnam. He pointed out that since South Vietnam was not an organized battlefield, without a front and a back, the use of tactical nuclear weapons would be more damaging for American troops and bases than for the national liberation forces.Secondly, the United States would not dare to use tactical nuclear weapons fearing that the Soviet Union and the People’s Republic of China would retaliate.Thirdly, the United States is also fearful of public opinion and the American people, which are increasingly opposed to the war in Vietnam.3. When asked whether the upcoming elections in the United States would influence the resolution of the conflict in Vietnam, the Vietnamese diplomat said that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the National Liberation Front are not linking the matter to the upcoming elections. The future elections would only change the wolf at the helm of the United States with a different one.4. My interlocutor then mentioned the fact that ‘some’ try to draw a comparison between the war and the revolution in South Vietnam and the war in Korea. He said that such a comparison did not make any sense, being completely unrealistic. It is imbued with wishful thinking, it denies the nature of the mass revolution of the Vietnamese people, and it does not recognize the efforts and successes achieved by the Vietnamese people (we believe that these references were made with certain North Korean personalities in mind).5. When asked for his opinion on the timing of the Korean unification, the Vietnamese diplomat said that the North Koreans are intensively preparing for this action and it would be possible that when the United States is almost crushed in South Vietnam, the North Koreans will take advantage of this moment and pursue the liberation of the South.6. As for the USS Pueblo case, the Vietnamese Ambassador said that the Americans were not interested in starting another war in Korea because they would be easily defeated there just as they are in South Vietnam.It seems that the peaceful resolution of this case through direct negotiations with the Americans would also be to the liking of the North Koreans, who realize that they are not yet totally ready [for war] and that it is not a propitious moment to pursue such a large-scale operation in the South.Signed: N.

All these documents were released to the public a while ago.In his statement, Director Pak made reference yet again to the well-known aspects of the incident, underlining that it can be solved peacefully only if the United States admits to the criminal act it had committed by deploying the USS Pueblo spy ship in the territorial waters of the DPRK. He remarked that in the current situation of maximum tension, war can break out at any moment in time and the American imperialists are the only ones to blame, adding that the future of the USS Pueblo depends entirely upon how the United States and their puppets in Seoul act.Pak Seokkyun expressed his gratitude for the manner in which our central press agency and the propaganda agencies in Romania reflected the Korean position with respect to the USS Pueblo incident, and then he underlined that in the current circumstances, it was paramount to thoroughly unmask the aggressive policy of the United States. He added that he would like to ask the Romanians to step up their condemnation of the US aggressive policy, including through governmental actions (here he was obviously hinting at the release of a governmental statement or at least of a statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs).With respect to the USS Pueblo case, I would like to inform you that the declarations of the People’s Republic of China, Democratic Republic of Vietnam, National Liberation Front in South Vietnam, the Communist Party of Cuba, the Mongolian Ministry of Foreign Affairs were published, while the foreign ministers of the German Democratic Republic, Czechoslovakia, and Soviet Union apparently held talks with the Korean ambassadors in their respective countries, under the guise of press interviews.We believe that for the time being, there are no special actions that the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs should take to preempt a recurrence of the USS Pueblo incident.

The American representative supposedly asked the North Koreans to allow him to pay a visit to the USS Pueblo crew members in order to corroborate the North Korean version of the story, which would then enable the Americans to admit to having violated North Korean territorial waters.Taking into account the possibility of talks between the United States and the Vietnamese, which has come up again and again these days, we believe that the North Koreans will try to solve the Pueblo case before the American-Vietnamese negotiations begin and this will be done to refute any speculations that the resolution of the Vietnamese matter depended on ending the row over USS Pueblo.Signed: N.

The Head of the Construction Section told A. Lazar that all diplomatic missions in Pyongyang were encouraged to build an anti-air defense bunker, in case they did not have one already, to protect foreigners against air attacks.When asked by the Romanian diplomat about the characteristics of the bunker (depth, shape, resistance) and about the deadline by which this bunker ought to be finalized, the interlocutor answered that after the agreement in principle of the Romanian government, the ODCD [Office of Services to the Diplomatic Corps] would immediately send a group of experts and specialists to the embassy to decide on where to install the bunker, and in accordance with the specific requirements of the ODCD, it would put together the project and the approval and would start the construction work.With respect to the deadline, he replied that the sooner, the better, as the situation was rapidly deteriorating.In conclusion, the Korean interlocutor made some vague references to the peaceful intentions of the DPRK, to its desire to prevent grave things from happening, but in the end he emphasized the peril of the resumption of war and the desire to insure the anti-air defenses of foreigners.With respect to the situation in Korea we would like to inform you about the following things:A state of general tension prevails in Pyongyang; troop movements and neighborhood anti-air defense drills continue; night alarm drills using planes and floodlights are intensifying; in Pyongyang and in the suburbs, anti-air bunkers from the Korean War have been restored and new bunkers have been built between apartment buildings and next to every single household.

",19680228,"On February 28, the Korean Central News Agency published a statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman on the extremely tense situation on the Korean peninsula.After mentioning that over the past year the provocative acts of the American occupiers and their puppets in Seoul have intensified, the statement mentions that, at the moment, the forces of the South Korean army, acting under the protective arm of the United States, are feverishly preparing for war, ‘which creates a very grave situation in Korea so that war can erupt at any point in time.’The Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman refutes the attempt of the South Koreans and the United States to put the blame on the DPRK for the current situation and assign guilt to the DPRK for the January 21 events in Seoul and for the illegal capture of the USS Pueblo vessel. The document underlines that the American imperialists are trying to use the USS Pueblo case to find a pretext for unleashing a war, ‘which is made clear by the fact that, at the negotiating table in Panmunjeom (on this issue—our note), they are not in possession of even the most basic form of scrupulousness, instead creating only obstruction with their hostile positions.’The conclusion of the declaration points out that ‘as long as the American imperialists are undertaking aggressive and warmongering acts, without assuming responsibility for them (here the North Koreans are pointing to the Pueblo incident—our note), and pursuing war maneuvers and blackmailing the DPRK, the current situation of extreme tensions cannot be diffused.’A day before, the Korean newspapers published a lengthy op-ed along the [party] lines which dealt with the tasks to be assumed by the Korean population in the current circumstances of ‘maximum tension’ and in case a war breaks out. The piece is imbued from the beginning until the end with an emphasis on the sacred duty of every worker and soldier in the People’s Army to ‘arm himself with the great revolutionary ideology of comrade Kim Il Sung, to reject all other ideologies except for this one, to think and to act only along the ideological lines and the will of the leader, to unconditionally carry out the orders and the indications of the leader, to defend with their own lives the Central Committee of the Korean Workers’ Party, led by comrade Kim Il Sung.’The article also stresses the need for a speedy development of the economy and defense capabilities, and emphasized on the duty of each economic unit to be ready and prepared to produce in the most critical conditions, on the need to efficiently run the military-strategic areas, to rapidly develop the military industry, to create stocks of provisions and fuel, etc.According to Radio Seoul, significant amounts of American weapons (part of the additional $100 million aid agreement) have already been shipped to South Korea.By the end of the month, South Korea will mobilize up to one million soldiers from their 2.5 million reserves, a threshold to be achieved by the summer of 1968.All South Korean localities are organizing self-defense units, which will be equipped with the light weapons from the South Korean Army, given that the South Korean Army will receive the new weaponry from the United States.Signed: N.

196,"Telegram from Pyongyang to Bucharest, TOP SECRET, No. 76.054, Urgent",19680301,"On March 1, a diplomat from the Hungarian Embassy in Pyongyang, S. Erte, told A. Lazar that during a recent conversation between the Hungarian Ambassador and Kim Changbong, the Minister of Defense of the DPRK, the Korean official asked the Hungarian authorities to approve his visit to Budapest with a Korean military delegation (which was supposed to take place in May—our note) at the beginning of April. The Korean official explained that this date is imposed on him by the situation in Korea and by the fact that after April 20 it would be impossible for him to travel abroad. Kim Changbong’s statement, linked with the fact that only four or five days ago all diplomatic missions in Pyongyang were urged to build anti-air bunkers, leads us to conclude that for a period of at least two months from now, the situation in Korea will not aggravate beyond the current point.On a different topic, the Hungarian diplomat showed that he possessed information according to which two weeks ago Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai had sent a personal message to Kim Il Sung through which he had proposed to jointly normalize Sino-Korean relations and to leave past quarrels behind. In the same message, Zhou Enlai mentioned the traditional friendship between the Chinese and the Korean people and reassured Kim Il Sung of the candor with which the Chinese people would be ready at any given point in time to give its full support to the Korean people.Asked about the source for this information, the Hungarian diplomat said that he had obtained it from the Chinese and that the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs asked its diplomatic mission in Pyongyang to verify it, if possible.Signed: N.

Hoholushek, the latter said that he had found out from Soviet sources that the DPRK Minister of National Defense, Kim Changbong, asked (on the occasion of his visit to Moscow in February—our note) Leonid Brezhnev for an assurance that, in case of the outbreak of war on the Korean peninsula, the Soviet Union would promptly intervene to the defense of the DPRK.The Czech diplomat added that throughout the three-hour conversation [with Kim Changbong], Brezhnev persisted in trying to persuade the Korean minister against resuming the war in Korea, underlining that just like in the case of Vietnam, this war would be a very tough one to win. The Korean minister pressed for at least a principled agreement from Brezhnev, which, to our mind, would be enough for the outbreak of war.Brezhnev concluded that if the DPRK had ignored his opinion, the USSR would not have replied positively to Korean calls for help.Hoholushek said that Soviet diplomats in Pyongyang believed that if Brezhnev had given some sort of nodding signs or vague assurances, a war in Korea would have definitely broken out.A. Lazar asked for the opinion of the Czech diplomat with respect to the new measures adopted by the Korean authorities regarding the interdiction of driving in the city from midnight until morning, and prohibiting the circulation of all vehicles (including diplomatic vehicles) without free circulation passes stuck to their front windows. In a nutshell, the Czech diplomat described these restrictions, which only continue the series of restrictions adopted earlier, as an undeclared state of emergency.On March 16, Radio Seoul announced during its evening broadcast that starting with that date, the army and the workers-peasants red guards in the DPRK were in a state of emergency.

199,"Telegram from Pyongyang to Bucharest, TOP SECRET, No. 76.069, Urgent",19680317,"On March 16, A. Lazar had a conversation with Wang Peng, counselor and Chargé d'affaires of the People’s Republic of China, from which we took note of the following important aspects:Contrary to the harsh language used previously by Chinese diplomats toward the DPRK party and state leadership and DPRK internal and foreign policy, it was noticeable that Wang Peng completely changed his approach, having become an active supporter of the forceful line promoted by the DPRK.The Chinese diplomat has repeatedly underlined that the war preparations of the DPRK are welcome, since it is certain that the United States wants to expand the battlefield in Asia, not only in Vietnam, Thailand, and Cambodia, but definitely in Korea as well. He added that the outbreak of war in Korea is inevitable, a logical consequence given that the country cannot remain separated indefinitely and that for the DPRK, this would be a just liberation war.Wang Peng said that as far as he knew, both parties had made intense war preparations, but the sole difficulty was the poor political training of the masses in South Korea, whose training was comparably inferior to the South Vietnamese masses, to withstand a long-term war and offer substantial help to the liberating forces from the North.A. Lazar said that given the situation in both Koreas, he did not contest the possibility of war reigniting, yet the diplomatic corps commented on the idea that the United States had found itself in a preposterous position in Vietnam and that because of the upcoming elections it would be impossible to open a new front in Vietnam.Wang Peng answered that this idea had the potential to demobilize the Korean people and it did not mirror reality, because it was still possible that the Americans would start a war in less than a week or two. We, the Chinese diplomat added, share the conviction of the Korean comrades that war is drawing near and the People’s Republic of China has repeatedly declared that it would grant its full support to the DPRK.A. Lazar added that it was beyond any doubt that in case the DPRK was attacked, it would receive the full support of socialist countries and especially from the People’s Republic of China and the Soviet Union. In this respect, the Romanian diplomat added, it seems that Premier Zhou Enlai sent a message to comrade Kim Il Sung in which Zhou Enlai had assured Kim Il Sung of the support of the People’s Republic of China in its anti-American struggle.Wang Peng did not deny the existence of a message but with noticeable surprise he said he had not known about such a document, but judging by its essence, it wouldn’t be too different from the Chinese governmental declaration released immediately after the incident with the USS Pueblo spy ship.A. Lazar tried to find out more about the results of the recent Sino-Korean economic negotiations. In this respect Wang Peng, just like in our previous conversations with him, avoided giving any concrete facts, figures, but he said that the amount of commercial exchanges for 1968 had increased compared with 1967; that the Chinese, to the best of their abilities, had almost entirely satisfied the demands of the Koreans, especially in terms of coke, coal (2 million, in terms of last year’s supplies), cotton, tires, salt supplies, etc. Wang Peng avoided giving a full answer to the question referring to the number and branches in which Chinese specialists are working in the DPRK, but he pointed out that Korean demands for technical-scientific assistance have multiplied lately and these demands include matters related to technical-military items. After pointing out that Sino-Korean bilateral relations have been reinvigorated and that the prospects for mitigating past quarrels are good, Wang Peng said that ‘I started to realize that at the basis of Soviet-Korean relations lay no political-ideological principles and the DPRK would have manifested its personality earlier on if it hadn’t been tied to the Soviet economic and military aid.’ He added that the DPRK would have the opportunity to verify that in the upcoming war, the People’s Republic of China would be its most reliable friend.A. Lazar asked whether the Chinese Embassy received the [Romanian] Agerpress bulletin on the consultative meeting in Budapest. Wang Peng thanked us for the respective materials and said that he had been informed about it by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and about the position of the Romanian Communist Party at the meeting.After the Romanian diplomat briefly presented the point of view of the Romanian Communist Party adopted by the Central Committee of the RCP on February 14 and the decision adopted on March 1 with respect to the international consultative meeting, Wang Peng said that personally he held in high regard the efforts and the principled position of the RCP at the consultative meeting. Wang Peng added that through the meeting in Budapest the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union demonstrated yet again its desire to enshrine as urgently as possible the split in the international workers’ and communist movement.Signed: N.

[Their relations] have remained unchanged, that is, they are good; [the two countries], at their discretion, mutually support each other’s struggle against aggressive American imperialism as far as they can.

According to the chargé d’affaires, this declaration well demonstrates the DRV standpoint on [the idea of] the common front of the “five Asian countries,” which has been recently so much emphasized by the Korean comrades. That is, the Vietnamese standpoint has remained unaltered, he said; since American imperialism is an enemy of every socialist country and of the entire mankind, not only of the “five countries,” it is necessary to achieve cooperation not only between the “five countries” but also between all anti-imperialist forces [emphasis in the original], and the main force of anti-imperialist struggle is not confined to the common front of a few countries but encompasses the whole socialist camp [emphasis in the original], for whose unity they, Vietnamese Communists, are fighting in the spirit of [1st President of Democratic Republic of Vietman] Comrade Ho Chi Minh’s last will.

Having received Comrade Malik on August 9, Comrade Kim Il Sung received Comrade Mazurov on August 15 (for a brief protocol visit) and also on [August] 18. [...] During the conversations, Kim Il Sung said the following:[...] On the Japanese C[ommunist] P[arty]: they maintain good relations with the Japanese CP, but they also have important differences of opinion. The Japanese CP and the Korean Workers’ Party see the militarization of Japan differently. The leaders of the Japanese CP bring such childish arguments up against the [North Korean claims about the] danger of Japan’s militarization that there is no such danger, nor is it possible, because the constitution prohibits it. The Japanese Socialists pay greater attention to this [issue] than the Communists. This is an opportunist error on the part of the JCP. [...] He repeatedly emphasized that the DPRK was firmly committed to reinforce and develop its contacts with the Soviet Union and the socialist countries, no matter whether the Chinese liked that or not.  We and the Chinese have differences of opinion on several big issues, he said. These are the following:a) In internal politics [emphasis in the original]: issues such as the contradictions among the people, the people’s communes, the Great Leap Forward, the Hundred Flowers [Movement], and the Cultural Revolution (with regard to the last one, he declared that they disagreed with it, and it would not suit Korea). Nevertheless, we regard them as the internal affairs [of China], and we do not interfere in them. b) In foreign politics [emphasis in the original]: The DPRK considers the Soviet Union a friendly country that is constructing communism. The Chinese say that the assistance with which the Soviet Union provides the anti-imperialist forces is a hoax and a swindle. They [the North Koreans] disagree with this.

[…] the Ambassador summarized the essence of what Kim Il Sung had said in the following words:[…] The current international situation is unfavorable for imperialism, the bankruptcy of American imperialism is becoming more and more manifest. This manifests itself in the following: internally, the USA is facing the prospect of a grave crisis, above all a financial crisis; the USA is suffering military defeats in various parts of the world, primarily in Indochina; the USA is losing its prestige, no one is bowing to it, even its most loyal allies—Jiang Jieshi, Park Chung Hee and [President of South Vietnam] Thieu—are losing their faith in it. […]According to our evaluation, Kim Il Sung said, now no one in the world, not even the USA, wants war. The Japanese people do not want war, Japan is currently unable to wage a war. Neither China nor we want war. Nor do the Soviet Union and the other socialist countries. In our view, under such circumstances it is possible to launch a peaceful attack. This was what we discussed at the [11th Central Committee] plenum [which was held on November 15-23].[…] At the plenum, the situation on the Korean Peninsula was discussed in detail. It was found that here it was also possible to launch a peaceful attack. The introduction of emergency measures revealed the weakness of the South Korean regime. The emergency measures are aimed at suppressing the South Korean [opposition] forces. The progressive forces are still weak in South Korea. There is no revolutionary situation in South Korea, that people [the South Korean population] is weak, the progressive forces need support to gain strength. For this purpose, one must first isolate the regime of Park Chung Hee, then make it go bankrupt. The means to achieve this aim is the peaceful attack. Following the peaceful attack, the South Korean people will see that the DPRK wants peaceful unification and the puppet clique does not want it. We did not, and will not, take any measure in response to the introduction of the emergency measures, Kim Il Sung said. We think we will come forward with new proposals. We wanted to take steps earlier, but now we are waiting a bit because of the introduction of the emergency measures. We want to make a proposal about the exchange of arts collectives and athletes between South and North. We leave an escape hatch for Park Chung Hee by [expressing] our willingness to negotiate with the rightist parties as well, Kim Il Sung said. He can use it if he wants to survive. If he does not [use it], he will perish.  […] In our view, there is nothing special in Nixon’s visit in the Soviet Union. In Stalin’s time, the Soviet Union had talks and signed agreements with Germany and Japan, [but these agreements] did not change [the socialist character of] the Soviet Union. While at that time the Soviet Union was weaker, now it is stronger, militarily stronger than the USA. Thus the Soviet Union is able to adopt a tough position during its talks with the USA. We know that the Soviet Union will not negotiate with Nixon at the expense of the interests of the socialist countries or the DPRK.[…] We will not participate in any kind of anti-Soviet affair. As an example I would like to mention that the Albanians invited us to their [6th] party congress [which was held on 1-7 November 1971]. We knew that they invited splittist [Maoist] groups as well. We were not present at the congress. We also told the Albanians not to send us anti-Soviet documents. Despite this [protest], they keep sending them; we do not publish the anti-Soviet parts [of these documents]. The Albanians are trying to provoke us into adopting an anti-Soviet stance, but we are not going to adopt such a stance. We also warned the Albanian delegate present at the congress of our Youth League not to make an anti-Soviet speech. Despite this [warning], he made such a speech. However, we did not translate the anti-Soviet parts of his speech. […] We will be always on friendly terms with you and we will not adopt an anti-Soviet stance. We think that you will not receive Nixon in the same way as the Romanians received him.

We mention that the South Korean propaganda means accessible to the embassy, are not engaged in such a campaign or aimed at antagonizing the North.Publicity from the side of the DPRK regarding certain political theses underlying the meaning and direction of North-South dialogue, has intensified.

Representatives of Pyongyang refused to take in consideration the creation of only two subcommittees, insisting on the simultaneous creation of all five (political, military, diplomatic, economic and cultural) planned in the second session of co-presidents in November 1972. This proposal was not accepted by Lee Hu-rak.Thus, due to the cautious attitude of the South and the “all or nothing” strategy of the north, the session ended without any notable success.At the press conference held on 16 March by Pyongyang-assigned co-president (to which press attaches of diplomatic missions were present), Deputy Prime Minister Pak Seong-cheol [Pak Song Chol] criticized South Korean authorities for fragmenting the issue of reunification in “simple” and “complex” issues, as well as for introducing “priorities” and “procedural sequences.” Pak Seong-cheol underlined that the “sincere wish towards reunification is sufficient for solving all problems, be they simple or complex, without any pre-established order and without preconceived procedures.”After analyzing the proceedings of the recent session, the rigid position of the DPRK who rejected Southern proposals (which, though did not exhaust all available possibilities, offered nevertheless the framework for economic, cultural, sports, etc. types of exchanges and contacts), we consider that the visible change of stance from the past of the DPRK has a lot to do with the country’s first victories resulting from synchronizing the inter-Korean dialogue with international developments (the opening of Sino-American dialogue regarding withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea).It is obvious that the DPRK is attempting, with the help of P.R. China or by itself, to gain the time necessary for obtaining the disengagement of the U.S. from the peninsula, which in turn would ensure a position of superiority for Pyongyang in inter-Korean negotiations.At the same time, the DPRK is expecting practical results from the comprehensive international campaign to make contacts (visits to approximately 45 different countries) aimed also at undermining South Korea externally.Encouraging existing trends of opinion at the international level concerning withdrawal of foreign troops from other territories, as well as increased demands of U.S. political personalities for withdrawal from South Korea and cessation of military help for Seoul, are of great interest to the DPRK.We therefore consider that the new DPRK tactic aims at achieving immediate objectives of unification without South Korea, even against it.The continuation of inter-Korean dialogue will therefore retain a formal character, depending mostly on indirect actions and various contingencies.Signed: Aurelian Lazar","['Lazar, Aurelian']","['Korean reunification question (1945- )', 'China--Foreign relations--Korea (North)', 'Korea (North)--Foreign relations--Korea (South)']"

Kim Yong-sun expressed the satisfaction and gratitude of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers’ Party, [and] of Comrade Kim Il Sung, for the warmth and hospitality with which the delegation of the Korean Workers’ Party, led by Kim Dong-gyu [Kim Tong Gyu], was received, for the special attention which this delegation enjoyed from the leadership of the Romanian Communist Party, [and] from Comrade Nicolae Ceausescu.Afterwards, the Deputy Head of the International Department of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers’ Party handed me a brief on the second session of the North-South Coordinating Committee, which took place recently in Pyongyang.Besides the main topics approached at this session, which we pointed out in our telegram no. 61084, Kim Yong-sun also informed us [about the following matters]:In the four-month interval between the first and second session of the North-South Coordinating Committee, there were contacts between North and South, but these contacts did not help diffuse the state of confrontation [between the two parties] and to ease the tension which has been accumulating.In these circumstances, the party leadership, comrade Kim Il Sung, after analyzing the situation, decided to steer the dialogue with the South towards practical measures, meant to eliminate the military confrontation between the two sides which is the primary condition for creating a climate of tension. [This decision] took shape in the well-known 5-point proposal, which was put forward by the North-Korean co-president of the committee (see our telegram no. 61084).It was highlighted that this line is not only the most righteous and rational [approach] to [engage] in a dialogue with South Korea, but also “a test for the loyalty of the South Korean puppets toward the cause of unification.”Kim Yong-sun showed that the negative reaction of the South [Korean] delegation toward the proposals of the North is circumscribed within the policy of the South Korean puppets to perpetuate the military confrontation and to achieve the unification of the country by means of “defeating communism,” [and] to participate to the dialogue strictly formally. He offered an overview of the situation in South Korea, referring to the intensification of war preparations and the psychosis against the DPRK, and he also underlined that this would trigger corresponding countermeasures from the North.The Deputy Head of the International Section said that the South [Korean] delegation would have blamed the North for inciting the “Revolutionary Party for Unification” in South Korea to violent revolution. He did not mention a thing, however, about the incident which occurred in a conversation between the two co-presidents [of the Committee] when in response to Lee Hu-rak’s assertion that the North started the war in June 1950, Pak Seong-cheol [Pak Song Chol] only said “what happened is in the past,” a statement recorded on tape and repeatedly played on South Korean radio.According to the brief [I received], the participants to the session discussed some technical problems, regarding the improvement of the permanent liaison apparatus in the Coordinating Committee, as well as regarding the publicity made about this session, but due to the obtuse attitude of the South Korean representatives, no further steps were made.Kim Yong-sun stressed that although no progress was made with respect to a drawing closer of the two sides’ points of view, the North scored a victory by having the following conclusions confirmed: the righteousness of [their] position to eliminate the state of military confrontation, the North’s dynamic and active affirmation in its interaction with the South at the international level, the exposure of the South [Korean] puppets’ policies, which under the guise of dialogue, are promoting confrontation and preparing for a new war, the reconfirmation of the idea that the North-South dialogue is a “fierce class struggle between revolution and counter-revolution, between patriotism and betrayal, between socialism and capitalism, a tough and complex struggle whose issues cannot be solved just through a few sessions, who is compelling [us] to strike the enemy whenever it is necessary.”Kim Yong-sun remarked that in the future, the [North] Korean party and government would militate for the promotion of dialogue, exposing the duplicitous tactics of the South. In conclusion, he expressed his hope that the Romanian Communist Party and the Romanian government would continue to grant the DPRK their support to the cause of the unification of Korea, exposing and isolating the South Korean puppet clique.The whole brief was formulated using very harsh words with respect to the Seoul authorities.With respect to our analysis of the significance and underpinnings of the new line promoted by the North in its confrontation with the South, we maintain the position we outlined in telegram no. 61.084.Signed: Dumitru Popa","['Popa, Dumitru']","['Korean reunification question (1945- )', 'Korea (North)--Foreign relations--Romania', 'Korea (North)--Foreign relations--Korea (South)']"

After insistently stressing on the unity of the Korean state and nation, Pak Seong-cheol said that “the Korean Workers’ Party will not allow for the perpetual dismantlement of the country, [which is] divided not through the will of the Korean people but due to external forces, [due to] American imperialists.” He said that the Korean Workers’ Party is promoting the peaceful reunification of the country, but “the DPRK will not remain inactive if the masses in the South will rise up and ask for help from the North.”In its dialogue with the South, the DPRK is currently undertaking a firm line, dealing with basic principles of inter-Korean relations: eliminating the state of military confrontation, scaling down the arms race, pulling out foreign armed forces, signing a peace treaty, [all of which] go against the position of the South Koreans to solve the problem gradually and partially.The refusal of the Seoul authorities to get involved in concrete and substantial matters regarding the rapprochement between North and South evidence the duplicitous tactics of the South Koreans, [which involves] a continuation of dialogue on the one hand and preparation for war on the other hand.At its turn, the DPRK feels compelled to do the same thing, taking all preparatory measures to retaliate accordingly to any provocation.In the current circumstances, when the DPRK is ranked number 1 in the world in terms of armed forces per capita and when it is being discussed to modernize them, it is necessary to sustain some important material efforts.At the same time, the intensification of the North-South dialogue and the inclusion of an increasing number of people in this process call for measures to improve the standard of living, so that the superiority of the socialist order can be proven through facts.This task compelled the DPRK to ask for help from abroad. In this respect, the Romanian party and state leadership allotted, with the help of former Vice-Premier Jeong Jun-taek [Jong Jun Thaek], a significant [portion] of aid, for which the Korean Workers’ Party is deeply grateful.With respect to bilateral relations, Pak Seong-cheol offered a very positive appraisal on their evolution in the interval following the visit to the DPRK of Comrade Nicolae Ceausescu and he underlined that Comrade Kim Il Sung repeatedly assigned to the Korean party and state cadres, the task to militate incessantly for the consolidation and development of collaboration with Romania.Talking about the recent visit to Romania of the delegation led by Kim Dong-gyu [Kim Tong Gyu], the Vice-Premier said that “Comrade Kim Il Sung was very happy with the honest, [and friendly] atmosphere in which the discussion with Comrade Nicolae Ceausescu [took place].” He said that the head of the Korean delegation presented a report before the Political Committee on matters related to his trip in Europe and that the results of his visit to Romania enjoyed the high appreciation of the party leadership.A summary of the main comments made at various levels of the North Korean party and government with respect to the party leadership’s visit to Romania and especially with respect to the meeting between Comrade Nicolae Ceausescu and Kim Dong-gyu makes us think that Comrade Kim Il Sung understood the meaning of the message sent by the Secretary General of the Romanian Communist Party, taking note of the value of the ideas suggested on this occasion.Signed: Dumitru Popa","['Popa, Dumitru']","['Korean reunification question (1945- )', 'Korea (North)--Foreign relations--Romania', 'Korea (North)--Foreign relations--Korea (South)']"

228,"Telegram from Pyongyang, No.061.113, Urgent, SECRET",19730404,"To the 2nd Direction, RelationsOn 3 April, on the occasion of a meeting with Kim Yeong-nam [Kim Yong Nam], the head of the International Section of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers’ Party, he discussed some of the reasons for which, at the latest meeting of the Coordinating Committee, the DPRK had insisted on the measures meant to bring about a relaxation of military tensions and a transformation of the Korean armistice into a peace treaty.Therefore, he mentioned that since the Vietnam War had ended and since there was a real opportunity to find a political solution to the Korean matter, certain dissensions sprung up within the top echelons of power in Seoul, especially in military circles. Park Chung Hee, Lee Hu-rak, the head of the Korean Central Intelligence Agency, and several other reactionary elements, with the support of the USA and Japan, were increasingly moving towards the right and in order to maintain their current positions, they were breaking up the process of unification into time sequences. This group is supported by South Korean generals, recently returned from Vietnam, who are instigating against North Korea “to unite the country by defeating communism,” etc. These dissensions amongst military cadres grew also as a consequence of the prospects of a reduction in military aid from the United States, which may impact on the material situation and morale of the South Korean army, which would create great uncertainty for career officers in the South Korean military. As a result of this upheaval amongst militaries, Park Chung Hee was recently compelled to remove from office one of his closest friends, i.e. the head of the Seoul garrison, and several other generals, justifying his decision by stating that they did not present enough trustworthiness. On the other hand, a certain deviation towards the left is growing increasingly prominent, as displayed by a large number of intellectuals and a great share of militaries, motivated primarily by patriotic feelings, who are more realistic about the possibilities to overcome clashes and differences that have piled on through the years, as a result of the different political systems in the two parts of Korea.I managed to gather from Kim Yeong-nam’s remarks that the recent proposals of the DPRK were meant to stimulate the leftist trends in South Korea, the aggravation of the internal contradictions which exist in the Seoul administration and military circles and only lastly [they aimed at] adopting some practical measures to achieve a relaxation of military tensions.My interlocutor mentioned that the DPRK would not be able to get along with Park Chung Hee because of his total submission to American and Japanese interests. Kim Yeong-nam hinted at the fact that the DPRK, by launching its well-known proposals, including the proposal referring to signing a peace treaty, wishes to put the South Korean authorities in a delicate position, one in which they cannot accept any of those proposals but at the same time in which they cannot interrupt the dialogue. Although unable to obtain any concrete successes through cooperation, the North Koreans are winning many followers amongst the opponents of Park Chung Hee, who will help the North Koreans topple the current regime in Seoul.Getting involved in economic, cultural-social exchanges with the South Koreans would only have created more problems and politically it would have been more efficient for the South, which would have used this [opportunity] as a foundation for its separatist tendencies, arguing that the North Koreans recognize South Korea as an economic and commercial partner.Signed: Dumitru Popa","['Popa, Dumitru']","['Korean reunification question (1945- )', 'Vietnam War, 1961-1975--Korea (North)', 'Korea (North)--Foreign relations--Korea (South)', 'Korea (South)--Foreign relations--United States', 'Park, Chung Hee, 1917-1979', 'Korea (South)--Politics and government', 'Vietnam War, 1961-1975--Korea (South)', 'Civil-military relations--Korea (South)']"

Therefore, the recent session of the Supreme People’s Assembly passed a law regarding the extension of the mandatory 10-year educational system which includes one year in preschool to the national level; this law will be enforced starting with the 1972-1973 academic year. Preschool education will be enforced at the national level until the beginning of the 1976-1977 academic year.With respect to the state budget for 1973, estimated at 8.543.510.000 won, this figure shows an increase by 16.9 percent compared to last year’s budget (which was 7.4 billion won, approximately $3.3 billion). For the year 1973, a crucial year for the accomplishment of the entire 6-year plan of the DPRK, it is planned to allocate increased shares of the budget for heavy industry, machine building industry, extraction industry and energy industry. Additional investments will be made in the chemical industry, light industry and consumer goods industry, with the specific purpose of raising the standard of living of the population.If military expenses amounted to 17 percent of the 1972 budget, for 1973, the military budget will be 15 percent of the total (1.282.000.000 won, the equivalent of $577 million).While taking part in the Supreme People’s Assembly session, we gathered that because of the open nature of this session, the event had a praising purpose, less critical of the existing shortcomings, displaying a weak disposition towards making criticisms and self-criticisms [for current problems]. Only after the repeated interventions of Comrade Kim Il Sung did they manage to overcome this situation, stimulating criticism and self-criticism, [summoning] the courage to tackle deficiencies and to find solutions to remedy or overcome hardships.Throughout the discussions we noticed the existence of certain deficiencies in the planning system, a weak activity of the economic and financial control bodies, etc., which, as Comrade Kim Il Sung mentioned in his short speech ending the session, lead to a certain state of stagnation, weak rhythm and poor correlation of economic sectors, which in turn, had negative repercussions on the entire national economy.During the session various shy references were made to the persistence of routine, fear to innovate—all of which are generated by the deficient technical and scientific training [of the workers].We also noticed that in budget report and throughout the discussions on it no mention had been made regarding the issue of collaborating or cooperating on economic and technological-scientific matters with outside [partners].Signed:Dumitru Popa","['Popa, Dumitru']","['Education--Korea (North)', 'Korea (North)--Armed Forces', 'Korea (North)--Economic conditions', 'Korea (North)--Foreign relations--United States', ""Korea (North).

232,"Telegram from Pyongyang, No.061.150, Urgent, SECRET",19730423,"To the First Direction, RelationsWith respect to inter-Korean relations, we would like to draw your attention to the fact that when important events, reunions, or contacts take place, provocations and sometimes serious incidents resulting in casualties spring up systematically in the demilitarized zone. By infringing on the commitments mutually agreed upon through the Joint Communiqué of July 1972, the situation is growing tense and the smooth development of the inter-Korean dialogue is hindered. Therefore, on 23 April, at the request of the Americans in the Armistice Commission a session took place at Panmunjeom, where the DPRK was charged with sending a group of spies in South Korea on the night of 17 April (3 people, 2 of whom were shot in the Southern part of the demilitarized zone) and was accused of not accepting to investigate this case jointly.Although the North Koreans publicly denounced this setting-up, the arguments they invoked were not convincing and categorical enough, which provided the authorities in Seoul and the Americans with plenty of ammunition to condemn the DPRK for “its duplicitous policies, aiming at winning the support of public opinion by charging the South and the Americans [for various things], while in reality being the one committing the provocations and perpetuating a state of tension on the Korean Peninsula.”In these circumstances, we believe that the second meeting of the South-North Coordinating Committee Secretariat, planned for 24 April in Panmunjeom, will unfold in a tense atmosphere.Irrespective of its authors, the aforementioned incident, as all the others from previous months, provide supportive arguments for the continued stationing of US troops in South Korea, and reasons for easily combating against the letters adopted at the recent session of the Supreme People’s Assembly addressed to the US Senate and House of Representatives.Signed: Dumitru Popa","['Popa, Dumitru']","['Korean reunification question (1945- )', 'Korea (North)--Foreign relations--United States', 'Korea (North)--Foreign relations--Korea (South)', 'Korean Demilitarized Zone (Korea)', ""Korea (North).

The propaganda apparatus in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea resumed the labeling of South Korea, showing some restraint, as it should have according to the commitments it assumed through the 4 July Joint Communiqué, only towards the South Korean president.  Although there was no consensus on the basic positions of the two parties with respect to unification from the very beginning of the dialogue, currently there is a noticeable drifting apart between the point of view of the North and that of the South on crucial matters to the Korean nation.Although rational in themselves, the proposals of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea put forward within the Coordinating Committee as well as in the meetings of the Red Cross delegations, are, because of their radical character, unacceptable to the authorities in Seoul, especially given that they were put forward in a block, without giving the possibility to negotiate on them.At their turn, the South Korean authorities, mended after the difficulties they underwent in the international arena and after the measures they adopted in the fall of last year [1972] and aware of the political implications of the North’s proposals, are manifesting reduced receptivity towards the path imposed by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Our attention was grabbed by the fact that lately, the South Korean mass media are carrying out an intense publicity campaign around some alleged cases of infiltrations in the South of Northern agents and around the mass condemnation of those who participated in a spy network working for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The North Korean press systematically refutes, sometimes in an insufficiently persuasive manner, these reports. Externally, there is a sustained concern from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to establish diplomatic relations and to join organizations where South Korea is already present. To our mind, this approach is not meant to draw the two countries closer, but on the contrary, it is supposed to undermine and gradually weaken the positions of the authorities in Seoul. Starting from this rationale, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is currently carefully studying the attitude it shall take towards the forthcoming session of the United Nations, especially since, recently, Seoul decided to register this matter on the agenda, going against its old position in favor of postponing a discussion of the Korean matter.Depending on the position it will take, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will or will not use the right it has owing to its membership in the World Health Organization to appoint an observer to the UN.Against this background, there will be another reunion of co-presidents of the South-North Coordinating Committee on 9 June.

In this respect, he said, at the secret meetings between the two co-presidents, Lee Hu-rak, the South Korean representative, said that South Korea would have been more receptive to the proposals of the North if the United States and Japan would not have exerted pressure on certain groups, especially on military groups in the South Korean governmental apparatus.There are several strands of thought developing in governmental circles in Seoul, and here Lee Hu-rak referred to the military trend as the most powerful one and the most hostile to unification, then to a centrist trend which is leaning towards contacts with the North (limited to economic and socio-cultural matters) and the opposition, comprising progressive and patriotic forces, which are keen on a rapid achievement of unification. An Jang-il described the situation in South Korea as unstable, which is why Seoul is trying to slow down the process of unification, formulating proposals to revise the agreements reached in July 1972 and the agreements which led to the creation of the South-North Coordinating Committee.The [North Korean] interlocutor mentioned that the third session in Seoul ended without achieving any concrete results, that there are new and great difficulties ahead in the field of North-South contacts, and that the duration of the process of unification is much longer than initially envisaged.Furthermore, An Jang-il said that currently South Korea launched an operation meant to enshrine the division of Korea by pushing towards the simultaneous accession of the two Koreas to the United Nations. “We fear,” he said, “that this South Korean plan will gain support from Third World countries, from those who do not know or who have a simplistic view of the solution for the Korean problem.”An Jang-il said that the propaganda agencies in the DPRK would launch an operation to unmask the intentions of the South Koreans and to explain Pyongyang’s position in light of comrade Kim Il Sung’s statement dated 23 June.

Generally, there is a noticeable state of tension and antagonism. After interrupting the dialogue with the South, both parties, but especially the North, vehemently attacks South Korea, which basically leads to the state of tension preceding the signing of the Joint Communiqué from 4 July 1972.According to press reports and radio broadcasts, party and community organizations, all the cadres in all the units discuss the speech of Comrade Kim Il Sung at the rally in Pyongyang organized on the occasion of Todor Zhivkov’s visit to the DPRK. These press reports and broadcasts contain strong ideas that peace in the Korean peninsula is endangered, that the peace announced by the American imperialists and the South Korean puppets is nothing else but a façade behind which the enemies of the Korean people are preparing a new war against the North, that peace must be conquered and defended with weapons, etc.In a recent discussion between the Romanian Ambassador and the Vice-Premier of the Administrative Council, Heo Dam [Ho Tam], the latter expressed his skepticism regarding the capability of the United Nations Organization to bring something new [to the table] to solve the Korean problem, showing that history demonstrated that plenty of the resolutions and decisions of this organization were ignored. Regarding the situation described above, at their turn, the South Korean authorities are manifesting a lot of concern regarding the “warmongering agitation and the provocations of the North,” regarding the frequent infiltrations in the South of some elements that prepared and supported the recent student movements in Seoul.",[],"['Korean reunification question (1945- )', 'Korea (North)--Foreign relations--Korea (South)', 'United Nations--Korea']"

At the end, with the participation of Comrade Kim Il Sung and other cadres from the high echelons of the DPRK party and state leadership a general gathering took place, with more than 20,000 participants, where O Jin-u [O Jin U], the chief of the Army staff presented a report on the state of political and military readiness in the current circumstances, discussing the immediate responsibilities of the Army. The General Secretary of the Korean Workers’ Party also spoke at this meeting.The briefs released to the press after the event indicate that the speakers unanimously underlined the necessity to continuously strengthen the political-revolutionary activity, to increase the level of technical and combat preparedness of the army.Special emphasis was put on the learning of modern combat techniques by the entire army, on “the transformation of the entire army into an army of military cadres.”After a prolonged absence, the idea that “under the leadership of Comrade Kim Il Sung, during our lifetime, we must chase away the American imperialists and achieve the reunification of the country” reemerged. The news discussing this gathering underlines that all speakers underscored their indignation that “the American imperialists and their fascist puppets in South Korea, under the guise of wanting to continue the dialogue, are preparing another war against the North.”From Aurelian Lazar’s discussions with A. Putinet and I. Taraba, the charges d’affaires ad interim from the USSR and from Hungary, respectively, it could be gathered that this gathering of military cadres was necessary because certain fiery elements within the ranks of the DPRK army appeared, who treated the situation in South Korea and the existing international circumstances superficially, and therefore believed that the current conditions were favorable to forcibly reuniting the country.Our sources tell us that this issue was the object of ample debates at the recent plenum of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers’ Party in September, where only through the energetic intervention of Comrade Kim Il Sung the force of this current of thought could be countered, which made it possible to continue on the same rational line of solving the Korean problem through peaceful political means.

Petrescu1. In a conversation with A. Lazar concerning recent declarations made at the U.N. by South Korean Foreign Minister Kim Yong-sik , concerning the intentions of South Korea to intensify efforts towards normalization of relations with the U.S.S.R. and P.R. China, counselor V. Denisov stated that no official relations are foreseeable for the near future between his country and Seoul. He pointed out that the U.S.S.R. representative to the U.N, Dobrynin, had a meeting with the South Korean foreign minister, with the occasion of which he explained that the U.S.S.R. will not meet South Korean wishes, the economic domain included. He noted however that the meeting, regardless of the results, constituted a political contact nevertheless. 2. In support of Kim Yong-sik’s declaration, radio broadcasts in South Korea report that Henry Kissinger told the Chinese leadership on the occasion of his visit to Beijing that the Seoul authorities would like to establish contacts and normalize relations with the People’s Republic of China.Chinese diplomats in Pyongyang reject the possibility of having Seoul’s message relayed to Beijing, but [sic!] they reject all possibilities to establish a Sino-South Korean link, irrespective of its nature.Signed: Aurelian Lazar","['Lazar, Aurelian']","['Korean reunification question (1945- )', 'Korea (North)--Foreign relations--Korea (South)', 'United Nations--Korea', 'Korea (South)--Foreign relations--Soviet Union', 'China--Foreign relations--Korea (South)']"

From the comments of socialist diplomats as well as of other countries, partially confirmed by the insistence with which the Korean press is justifying the position of the DPRK government, it has become apparent that some members of the Korean leadership, militaries most of all, have not fully grasped the concession made in favor of U.S. troops stationing in South Korea, an issue which remained outside the final document adopted on 21 November.On the other hand, the realist spirit in which the U.N. has solved this issue is ignored in North-South relations. Polemics on various topics is intensifying. On the backdrop of political tensions on both sides, throughout the last days military elements have sprung, motivated by the repeated entry of DPRK ships in the territorial waters of islands recently claimed by the North (next to Haeju port in the Yellow Sea). This course of action, explained by DPRK as a means of exercising legitimate control in these territories, is seen by authorities in Seoul as the most serious incident since the ‘Pueblo Case’ in 1968 which triggered a state of military alert from the part of South Korea, coupled with the threat that a future similar attempt would result in retaliation. In case DPRK aimed these actions at supporting student movements in South Korea, the result was the opposite, as the general mobilization of the army is on the verge of resulting in the forceful repression of youth movements.   We note that conversely, the authorities in Seoul used this action to pass through parliament—without objections—the military budget for 1974.Signed: Aurelian Lazar","['Lazar, Aurelian']","['Protest movements--Korea (South)', 'Korean reunification question (1945- )', 'Northern Limit Line Dispute, 1973-', 'Territorial waters--Korea (South)', 'Territorial waters--Korea (North)', 'Korea (North)--Foreign relations--Korea (South)', 'United Nations--Korea', 'Korea (North)--Military policy', 'Korea (North)--Military relations--Korea (South)']"

In the recent months, Park Chung Hee’s political position has become more unstable. He could expect a rift within the establishment. By launching a massive campaign over the incident and appealing to the emotions [of the South Korean population], Park Chung Hee might be able to achieve a temporary re-stabilization of his rule.Both sides are interested in keeping the tension alive, but, in the view of Smoldas, the northerners made a great tactical mistake when they got involved in the incident in such a political situation that was more advantageous to them [than to Park Chung Hee]. The general also considers it possible that the incident occurred by accident, in the sense that the commander of the northern ship might have lost self-control, and presumably opened fire at the spy ships disguised as fishing boats at a time when they were still on the high seas.

Through Comrade Yang Hyong-sop, who took part in the 10th Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, I would like to inform you of the new measures recently adopted by our Party in connection with the question of the unification of the Motherland and to exchange opinions with you about some views of ours regarding the Third World and the Non-Aligned Movement.As one of the founders of the Non-Aligned Movement, you are making a great contribution to the cause of strengthening and developing this Movement, and your valuable opinions would serve as a great help in our work.I express confidence that the close relations of friendship and collaboration which have developed between the Parties, governments, and peoples of both our countries will henceforth be tirelessly strengthened and developed on the basis of the principles of Marxism-Leninism, equality, independence, mutual respect, non-interference in the internal affairs [of one another], and comradely collaboration, and from the bottom of [my] heart I wish you good health, happiness, and new successes in your responsible work.With comradely greetings,GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE KOREAN WORKER’S PARTY, PRESIDENT OF THE DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF KOREAKIM IL SUNGPyongyang, [date left blank] May 1974[Translator’s note: this message follows the above, without any date or salutation:](Translation)Permit me to express to you, Comrade Josip Broz Tito, [my] deep appreciation for the fact that you have devoted the time and have warmly received our delegation, in spite of your great workload.First of all let me pass to you, Comrade Josip Broz Tito, the Chairman of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and President of the Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia, a comradely, friendly greeting from the General Secretary of the CC of our Party and President of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Comrade Kim Il Sung.The Central Committee of our Party is grateful to the Central Committee of your Party for the kind invitation to our Party delegation to take part in your Party Congress.Comrade Kim Il Sung values the fraternal friendship and solidarity with the Union of Communists and the people of Yugoslavia.This time, in sending us, Comrade Kim Il Sung has given us convincing insistence to promote the further development of friendly relations between the Parties and peoples of both countries, which are developing productively.He also charged [us] with paying a visit to you, Comrade Josip Broz Tito, and talking about some of the following questions.With your permission, right now I would like to pass to you the words of Comrade Kim Il Sung addressed to you, Comrade Josip Broz Tito.Dear Comrade Josip Broz Tito!Through Comrade Yang Hyong-sop, a member of the Political Committee and Secretary of the CC of our Party, who took part in the 10th Congress of your Party at the invitation of the CC of your Party, I want to tell you of the new measures recently taken by our Party and government on the question of the reunification of Korea, and also about the position of our Party associated with the Third World and the Non-Aligned Movement.First I would like to briefly touch on our proposal about the conclusion of a peace agreement with the US.As you probably already know, in March of this year at the fifth convocation of the 3rd session of the Supreme People’s Assembly we decided to hold talks with the US in order to conclude a peace agreement and sent a letter about this to the US Congress.Now in order to eliminate the tension in Korea and speed up the peaceful reunification of the country it is first of all necessary to eliminate the state of military confrontation between the North and South and replace the Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement.However, the whole course of the dialogue between the North and South shows that the south Korean rulers do not want a reunification of the country and do not intend to eliminate the military confrontation between the North and South or to conclude a peace agreement. In trying to consolidate the current situation of a division of the country into North and South and manufacture “two Koreas” they, on the one hand, are increasing the fascist repression of the south Korean population and, on the other, are feverishly making new military preparations against the northern part of the Republic.Such criminal actions of the south Korean puppets are being made under the active instigation of the United States. The US continues to give the south Korean rulers weapons and military equipment, they are expanding military bases in south Korea, and continually conduct military exercises together with the south Korean puppets.Without the elimination of the US interference in the internal affairs of Korea it is impossible to achieve either a durable peace in Korea or the independent peaceful reunification of our Motherland.However, the south Korea rulers not only have no intention of removing outside forces but they also are completely unable to do this.As the whole world knows, the right to command the south Korean army does not belong to the south Korea rulers but to the Commanding General of US troops, who is there under the name of “the Commanding General of UN Forces”, and it is the American troops deployed in south Korean who have the right to command the various weapons and military equipment. It is clear that in these circumstances it is impossible to decide either the question of the elimination of tension and the securing of peace in Korea with the south Korea rulers or any other question connected with the reunification of the Motherland. That is why we want to hold talks directly with the US, which has the actual right to decide the question of the replacement of the armistice agreement with a peace agreement and which is one of the actual interested parties which signed the Armistice Agreement in Korea; thus, to achieve the withdrawal of American forces from south Korea and to create preconditions for the solution of the question of the reunification of our Motherland with the efforts of the Koreans themselves.We have proposed including the following in a peace agreement which would be concluded with the US: both parties are commit themselves not to attack one another; the US will commit itself to neither protect or incite the south Korean rulers, and not obstruct the peaceful reunification of Korea; both parties should stop building up [their] armed forces and the arms race; foreign troops there under the label of “UN forces” should be withdrawn from south Korea, and Korea will not become a military or operational base for any other country after the withdrawal of the foreign troops.In the final account, the peace agreement which we advocate is directed at the liquidation of a constant hotbed of war in Korea and the elimination of outside forces, the main obstacle to the reunification of our country.We unalterably insist that in no event can the question of the reunification of our country be decided if we hand it over to bargaining between the great powers.A direct approach to the US with a proposal to hold talks will give us the opportunity and more strongly take the initiative in our hands on the question of the reunification of our country.If the US authorities have no intention of pursuing a policy of division and war then they cannot have any excuse or reason for not agreeing to hold direct talks on the question of the conclusion of a peace agreement.In our opinion, our proposal about holding direct talks with the US will also be productive for exposing to the entire world that the south Korean rules are traitors to the Motherland and puppets without any real power, which will further isolate then in the international arena.At the present time the south Korean rules are very worried that the US will enter into talks with us without taking them into consideration, and are shrewdly trying to obstruct this in every possible way.We think that if the US does not continue to support such a bastard as Park Chung-hee, rejected by the people as an inveterate fascist unprecedented in the history of the East or West, and enters into talks with us without delay, then a new way out of Korea will open for the US itself without shame.It is a matter of whether the US will make changes to its policy with regard to Korea or not.If, as before, the US relies on such a person as Park Chung Hee to pursue the goal of perpetuating national division and the fabrication of “two Koreas” and preserving the colonial fascist dominance, then the people of south Korea will not just view this indifferently.When the south Korean people rise up in revolt and ask us for help, then we will not be able to sit with folded arms. The struggle of the south Korean people is a just struggle for freedom and liberation, and our active support of their revolutionary struggle is a proper national duty.In such an event it appears that such a danger is not excluded of the US again being drawn into such events in Korea as occurred in Vietnam.We think that before such a turn of events that the US should abandon the aggressive policy with respect to Korea and enter into dialog with us beforehand, which would also completely meet the interests of the American people, who oppose war and love peace.I would like to express my confidence that you, Comrade Josip Broz Tito, will put pressure on the US and make use of your influence to mobilize world public opinion to implement our even-handed proposal to hold direct talks with the US.Further, I would like to express some considerations with respect to increasing the strength of the peoples of the Third World.Today the peoples of the world are taking the course of independence, which has become an invincible trend of the time.In particular, the peoples of the Third World, who in the past were subjected to exploitation and oppression from the imperialists, have strongly taken their fates in their own hands and are acting as the masters in a historic arena. We think that today the countries of the Third World are the main strength of the world revolution.But some powers nevertheless do not see the changed reality and, striving to continue dominance of the world, are trying to manage the fates of the countries of the Third World.We think the countries of the Third World need to even further strengthen solidarity under the banner of independence in order to be saved from dominance and control from outside.In fact, the Third World comprises a large number of countries and population, has a broad territory and many natural resources, and therefore we think the Third World can accomplish anything and restrain any great power if only they unite.When the countries of the Third World rationally mobilize in unity and use their potential then, in our opinion, they would make the anti-imperialist forces several times stronger and exert an ever more decisive influence on the development of the international situation.The UN General Assembly session held recently on the question of raw materials and development convincingly demonstrated the united power of the peoples of the Third World who are fighting for independent development. We insist that the peoples of the countries of the Third World ought to firmly band together to ensure a durable peace in the entire world and the security of humanity, break up the old procedure of international relations established in the interests of the great powers, and affirm a new way of international relations meeting the interests of the peoples of the Third World.We think that it is important not only to strengthen the unity and cohesion of the peoples of the countries of the Third World, but to also free such countries of the Second World as France, Japan, Canada, and others, which are subjected to their pressure from the influence of the great powers so that they do not blindly follow these powers.It is true that France, Japan, Canada, and the other countries of the Second World have relations of alliance with the US and common positions with it, but on a number of questions their interests are not identical.In addition, these countries do not have sufficient natural resources, so that they rely on the rich resources of the countries of the Third World for the development of the economies of their countries. Although they assert that the developing countries cannot live without their “help”, in fact they are not able to live without the fuel and raw materials of the countries of the Third World. The energy crisis, which enveloped the capitalist world as a result of the vigorous measures of the Arab countries adopted in connection with the war in the Middle East in October of last year, eloquently tells of this.If the countries of the Third World make skillful use of such adversarial relations between the powers and their weaknesses then, in our opinion, they could win over the countries of the Second World and form a united front with them.As it seems to us, if the countries of the Third World increase their solidarity, enlist the countries of the Second World, and wage a skillful struggle, then they could also have the final word in the United Nations. In such an event the United Nations itself could be turned into a genuine organization of peace and progress serving the interests of the peoples of the Third World, and make such an arena of the superpowers like the Security Council correspondingly inoperative, and wreck the attempts of some of the big countries to turn the UN into their plaything.We think that if the struggle continues in such a direction then in the future a new organization like the UN headed by the countries of the Third World might be created independent of the existing UN.In our opinion, the possibility is not excluded of convening a conference of newborn forces of the Third World at an appropriate time in order to organize and develop such a movement.You, Comrade Josip Broz Tito, as one of the generally-recognized eminent leaders of the Third World, have truly done much in the name of the unity and independence of the peoples of the Third World. We hope that in the future you will make a great contribution to this noble cause.Further, I would like to dwell on the question of the participation of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea in the Non-Aligned Movement to make an active contribution to strengthening the solidarity of the Third World and the further development of the world revolutionary movement.We have always devoted deep attention to the Non-Aligned Movement and highly appreciate its anti-militaristic, peace-loving, and progressive role.The Non-Aligned Movement, directed against all forms of aggression, enslavement, and inequality, plays an important role in strengthening the unity and solidarity of the anti-imperialist forces, including the countries of the Third World, and is making a great contribution at the present time to the development of  the world revolutionary movement. And our country, as a country belonging to the Third World, desires to join the ranks of the Non-Aligned Countries if they do not object to this.Inasmuch as there is a good precedent, that although Yugoslavia is a socialist country, but at the same time as a country belonging to the Third World, it plays a great role in the ranks of the nonaligned countries, and we think we could join the ranks of the nonaligned countries and pursue our activity among them.True, here we have other problems unlike Yugoslavia.This is conditioned by the fact that our country has bilateral military alliances with other socialist countries. But this is essentially unlike the fact that others are members of such a multilateral military bloc as the Warsaw Pact. In addition, we have no foreign military bases in the country.Inasmuch as we are actively fighting against imperialism, colonialism, and for independence, in our opinion this is in our opinion a problem which can be overcome and does not serve as a great hindrance to our participation in the Non-Aligned Movement.We are not forgetting that in the past year you, Comrade Josip Broz Tito, have applied every sincere effort to invite us to take part as an observer at the highest level in the 4th Conference of Non-Aligned Countries in Algiers.You are one of the founders of the Non-Aligned Movement and have many years of rich experience in the development of this movement, and therefore I think that you could give us great help in this question.Here I have finished passing you the words of Comrade Kim Il Sung.We would be very grateful to you if you would express your valuable opinions on these questions.I thank you for the attention.","['Kim, Il Sung']","['Korean reunification question (1945- )', 'Non-Aligned Movement', 'Korea (North)--Foreign relations--Yugoslavia', 'Korea (South)--Foreign relations--United States', 'United States--Foreign relations--Yugoslavia']"

The comments of the diplomatic community in Pyongyang concerning this situation often indicate that the US, while losing ground in Southeast Asia, do not wish to worsen their position in the Korean Peninsula; that the intensification of US activities in South Korea is due to the increased confrontations between the USSR and the People’s Republic China, on the one hand, and Japan and the US on the other; that the increase of US troops in Seoul is made at the request of South Korean authorities and of their complete lack of resistance. There is also mention that these developments are due to preparations for war of the North Korean side, to declarations of Pyongyang officials to the effect that the next war or South Korean revolution must be used towards reunification.The continued tension of internal situation in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the declarations of most authorized Korean personalities concerning “the approach of the great revolutionary event,” are strong pretexts for South Korea and its allies to balance the ability for confrontation.Signed: Dumitru Popa","['Popa, Dumitru']","['Korea (North)--Foreign relations--United States', 'Korea (North)--Foreign relations--Korea (South)', 'Korea (North)--Military policy']"

South Koreans are intensely “assisting” South Vietnamese refugees, by providing them with food, medicine and transportation means for their evacuation from dangerous areas.At the same time, with the intensification of anti-communist propaganda and the increase to a maximum of the “Northern danger,” measures are being taken in South Korea for preventing any type of disorder. Thus, new restrictions, backed by last year’s decrees for exceptional situations, have been again set in place over the last days. An increase in the number of arrests, together with an intensified censorship of the opposition’s political activity is being registered.We note an increased activity of the union of progressive forces under the leadership of neo-democratic and unity parties, a coalition that we deem capable of successfully conducting activities against the current President Park Chung Hee. Nevertheless we note that presently in South Korea not even the opposition fosters anti-American feelings, which helps the authorities in Seoul and the US, which until now does not allow for the possibility to renounce the positions they occupied in the country.Signed: Dumitru Popa","['Popa, Dumitru']","['Vietnam War, 1961-1975--Korea (North)', 'Korea (South)--Foreign relations--United States', 'Vietnam War, 1961-1975--Korea (South)']"

It is possible that the US, as a result of an implied understanding, will take measures towards de facto dissolving the UN headquarters.In such circumstances, the General Assembly or the Security Council shall solely take note of the UN headquarters [in Korea] dismantling, similar to 1973, when the UN Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea was dissolved.

Through the above-mentioned conditions, the US is actually seeking to force North Korea into accepting the presence of American troops in South Korea and accept the latter as a state.

The North Korean Ambassador has received instructions from home concerning his future actions at the UN.

Presently, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is carefully studying the American proposal and in a very near future will present the UN with its point of view.Heo Dam mentioned that no point of the US proposal can be accepted as such by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the following reasons:  - the document is of a “reactionary and misleading” character. The worldwide public opinion could be induced to believe that the Americans are the one wishing for a dismantling of the UN headquarters in South Korea. In reality, the US will keep its presence in this country, while claiming its troops are not foreign. The US proposal aims in fact at obtaining the Democratic People's Republic of Korea’s agreement to US military presence and continuity in South Korea.- the American proposal aims at making South Korea visible on the international scene and increasing its prestige. Our conversation partner noted that, in its turn, Japan is actively supporting this county, given its strategic importance and the Japanese interests. Moreover, Japan has invested significant capital in South Korea and presently has a good market there for its products.- the proposal that US and South Korean officers replace the leadership responsible for securing the ceasefire, as well as the presence of Chinese volunteers, would imply that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea accepts interference in its internal affairs from the past of great powers such as the US, the People’s Republic China, and would result in a breach of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea’s national independence and sovereignty. At the same time, US troops presence in South Korea would become permanent and implicitly so would “the continued existence of two Koreas.”- the US has proceeded with presenting its document, knowing that the fall of this year the UN General Assembly will adopt, with overwhelming majority, a resolution favorable to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.  Heo Dam has mentioned that his country does not see the document as a step back in the US position towards the Korean matter at the UN, and is therefore “a success of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.” In answering a question of the Romanian Ambassador, the Korean Foreign Affairs Minister noted that this year the Democratic People's Republic of Korea would send special delegations to numerous countries in the world, personal representatives of President Kim Il Sung, in order to explain in detail his country’s point of view in the Korean matter, as well as the position the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will adopt during the next UN General Assembly in order to ask for support, prevent the admission into the UN of two Koreas and diminish the effects of South Korean attempts to join the group of non-aligned countries.Signed: D.Popa","['Popa, Dumitru']","['Korean reunification question (1945- )', 'Korea (North)--Foreign relations--United States', 'Korea (North)--Foreign relations--Korea (South)', 'United Nations--Korea']"

Such statements are founded on the fact that lately, the United States talk more and more about a policy of ‘rapprochement’ and of ‘peace.’ But such assumptions are groundless and they stem from not knowing exactly the reality in the region, the manner in which the American imperialists act. When analyzing the situation in the Korean Peninsula, one must always take into account the big interests that the United States and Japan have in the region. Against this background, pointed out Kim Yeong-nam, the Tanaka government in Japan, supported by reactionary militarist elements in Japan, promoted an unfriendly, even enemy-like approach towards the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.Prime Minister Takeo Miki, said our interlocutor, brought, to a certain extent, some new elements in Japan’s approach towards the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, showing a more understanding attitude, and evidencing some flexibility. But such positive elements are little sensed, they are unconvincing. The support given by Prime Minister Takeo Miki is not sufficiently solid and therefore he is adopting an unstable, oscillating position. Militarist circles, reactionary elements in Japan continue their hostile propaganda towards the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, stating that in case of the breakout of a war, if American troops are withdrawn from South Korea, Japan is ready to intervene in Korea with its naval and air armed forces. Japan continues to transfer naval forces from Okinawa to American bases in South Korea, with the consent of the Park Chung Hee clique. American-Japanese-South Korean joint military drills are intensifying. At their turn, the South Korean puppets assert that their armed forces are capable of facing off the North Koreans in a military confrontation on their own, which is why they are preparing [so much].The struggle of the popular masses in South Korea for the democratization of society, for the peaceful and independent unification of the homeland is intensifying every day, integrating various social layers and adopting ever more well organized forms, so that they adopt documents like the “Declaration for Democracy and Salvation of the Nation” (March 1st, 1976).Peace-loving peoples in the entire world support the struggle of the Korean people. In Europe and in other parts of the world, solidarity committees are formed, which support the just cause of the Korean people, condemning the anti-popular regime of the South Korean puppets. Numerous youth, women’s, community, religious organizations in Japan, in other countries, criticize the position of those respective countries towards the Democratic People's Republic of Korea through organized efforts—rallies, conferences, etc.—to show their support for the struggle of the Korean people.Signed: Charge d’Affaires V.

The situation in the Korean Peninsula remains possibly the most explosive one in Asia, with real possibilities to get the big powers involved in the eventuality of a conflict breaking out. 2. Lately the political tensions in South Korea are rising. The intensification of anti-government demonstrations contributes to maintain this state of tension and the possibility to have the South Korean administration lose control over the situation, which would bring about an even tougher attitude towards the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, descending into an armed conflict. In addition to the fact that Seoul has a better economic situation, a better trained and better equipped army (the rapport would be 2 to 1 compared to the North Korean army), South Korea is amongst those countries which are capable of producing nuclear weapons, with all the restrictions and preventive measures imposed by the United States of America. All these could compel the Seoul authorities to undertake a military venture.3. Judging from the data of the Department of State, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea asked for a postponement of its foreign debt repayment, which indicates a bad economic situation. That, combined with an inaccurate understanding of the situation in South Korea (where anti-government demonstrations could be interpreted as a sign of the administration’s weakness), could be a reason to accelerate [North Korea’s] attacks on South Korea.4. The Department of State believes that action must be taken with respect to both states to make them abstain from measures or actions which would lead to an increase in the tension on the Korean Peninsula. Therefore, they believe that if the Korean matter cannot be taken off the agenda of the UN General Assembly session, debates should in any case be limited to realities, and sensitive areas which may trigger undesired effects should not be exacerbated.Signed: Corneliu Bogdan","['Bogdan, Corneliu ']","['Korea (North)--Foreign economic relations', 'Protest movements--Korea (South)', 'Nuclear weapons--Korea (South)', 'Korea (North)--Foreign relations--Korea (South)', 'United Nations--Korea', 'Korea (South)--Politics and government', 'Korea (North)--Military policy', 'Korea (South)--Military relations--United States']"
293,"Hungarian Embassy in the DPRK, Report, 28 April 1976. Subject: Visit of an Ethiopian government delegation in the DPRK.",19760428,"On 23-30 March 1976, Moges Wolde-Michael, the chairman of the Economic Committee of the Ethiopian Provisional Military Administrative Council, paid a friendly visit to the DPRK as the head of a government delegation. During the rule of Emperor Haile Selassie, there had not been diplomatic relations between [the two countries], as Ethiopia was one of the 16 states which sent so-called UN troops to the Korean War on the side of the Americans and the South Koreans. A substantial change could occur only after that in 1974—as Moges Wolde-Michael put it—the Ethiopian people overthrew the rule of the feudal-bourgeois [circles]. Diplomatic relations were established in June 1975.The fraternal government delegation of the socialist Ethiopia was given special attention. Although the negotiating partner of Moges Wolde-Michael was Deputy Premier Jeong Jun-gi, Vice-President Kang Ryang-uk also attended the receptions. On March  26, head of state Kim Il Sung received the Ethiopian government delegation, and gave a lunch to their honor.According to the information received from the Foreign Ministry, the Ethiopian government delegation visited the DPRK in order to inform [the North Koreans] about the progress of the Ethiopian revolution, and to ask the DPRK for economic aid. During the negotiations and programs, and in the speeches they made at a mass meeting, they emphasized the significance of the two countries’ anti-imperialist struggle and of their membership in the Non-Aligned Movement. On one occasion, Moges Wolde-Michael declared that “The DPRK and Ethiopia fight on the same front against imperialism, colonialism, and Zionism.” The Ethiopian government delegation expressed its support to the struggle of the Korean people. Ethiopia supports the struggle for the unification of Korea, and the aforesaid visit “created a firm and eternal basis for the friendly relations and cooperation between the two countries.”In his public speeches, Moges Wolde-Michael generously lavished the kind of praise that is welcomed in Pyongyang. He praised the juche idea that had enabled the DPRK to perform miracles, “which is attributable to the genial guidance of President Kim Il Sung, the great and excellent leader, and to the diligent work of the Korean people.” He declared that the example of Korea was worth following, and stated that “The political independence and economic self-reliance, which is resolutely defended by the Korean people, is an excellent model for the socialist Ethiopian people.”According to the information we received in the Foreign Ministry, during the confidential talks Moges Wolde-Michael frequently reiterated that the old Ethiopia had committed an indelible crime when it participated in the war against the Korean people. The head of the government delegation emphasized that this had been a crime of the old leadership, for the new government pursued a policy of friendship with the Korean people. The other main objective of the Ethiopian delegation was to conclude agreements in the field of economic cooperation, and to obtain credit for Ethiopia from the DPRK. Choe Un-ryong, a deputy departmental head of the 1st Main Department of the FM [Foreign Ministry] who provided us with information about this issue in response of our request, said that the Ethiopian delegation handed over a thick volume [that contained the list of their requests]. They ask for the DPRK’s assistance to the creation of the new [socialist] villages in Ethiopia, and to the construction of power stations and a wide range of industrial plants.  The DPRK was surprised by this request for such an immense amount of aid. They did not expect such a bulky list of requests. Jeong Jun-gi merely told the Ethiopian delegation that the DPRK would examine the requests, and it would restart talks about those ones whose fulfillment it considered possible.The delegation headed by Moges Wolde-Michael also included a military delegate, but the Ethiopian delegation made no request of a military nature to the DPRK. This is in contradiction with the news which have spread within the diplomatic corps in Pyongyang.Ferenc Szabóambassador",[],"['Juche Idea', 'Ethiopia--Foreign relations--Korea (North)']"

He added that the African—including Mauritanian—contacts of the Republic of Mali might be helpful for the DPRK. In the opinion of the fraternal [diplomats], the delegation was received at a high level. The first speech of the Malian head of state was a reserved one as far as international affairs and the adulation of the DPRK were concerned. He spoke on the achievements of the struggles in Indochina and Africa, on the assistance provided by the socialist countries, on the Middle East, and on [the proposal] to make the Indian Ocean a zone of peace. On the Korean question, Mali has adopted and supported the standpoint of the DPRK. The movement of the non-aligned countries was extensively covered during the negotiations and in the speeches.The two sides are in agreement on that the 5th conference of the movement will be of historical significance. In his later speeches, the [Malian] head of state laid increasing stress on praising juche and Kim Il Sung. He called the achievements and experiences of the DPRK a model for the developing countries. The entourage of the head of state was composed mainly of economic experts. In the view of the Syrian ambassador, the agreement on economic and technical cooperation, which they signed, is not an important one. It has only political significance. The head of state made no request to the DPRK.In the opinion of the Soviet ambassador, a section of the delegation specifically studied the structure of the Korean Workers’ Party and the party’s methods of operation. They intend to apply these experiences in the establishment of their party [the Democratic Union of the Malian People].133 – Sz.",[],"['Korean reunification question (1945- )', 'Non-Aligned Movement', 'Nonalignment--Korea (North)', 'Korea (North)--Foreign relations--Mali']"

OCTOBER 1976, 11.08amCase: Smuggling at North Korean Embassy in Oslo. North Korea’s Ambassador [Hyeon Jun-geuk (Hyun Jun Guk)] requested a meeting today and informed [me] of the following:The North Korean Embassy in Beijing was just informed of the events in Oslo. He wished to inform the embassy of his views, and asked for consultations and cooperation on the issue. He opened by stating that because of my function as Ambassador to North Korea, it was natural to consult me. He was aware of the decision by the Norwegian Government to order the diplomats to leave the country as a result of their illegal activities. This was entirely new information to the Ambassador, and he expressed doubts about the validity of the claims. He then said that the wish to improve the relationship between our two countries was the reason why North Korea had established diplomatic relations with Norway in the first place. In accordance with the policies of North Korea, they had worked hard to ensure good relations with Norway. Their embassy in Oslo had displayed utmost respect for Norwegian law, and carried out their work within Norwegian legal boundaries. He could hardly believe that members of North Korea’s Embassy had been engaged in illegal activities. Despite the improbable nature of the issue, Norwegian authorities had taken unilateral action and ordered the North Korean embassy personnel to leave the country without consulting North Korean authorities. This was most regrettable to the North Koreans.He went on to say that the North Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs would take measures to clarify whether or not the diplomats had been involved in illegal activities. If this turned out to be the case, it would constitute a violation of government policy, and the involved staff would be punished.He again expressed his regrets that the Norwegian government had taken the unexpected step to expel the embassy personnel without consultation or negotiation with the North Korean government without considering how this may be detrimental to relations between the two countries. He hoped our two countries could resolve the issue so as to prevent a deterioration of our good relationship as a result of this issue. The Ambassador went on to suggest that if the claims of illegal activities turns out to be true, it may very well be that individuals acting against the will of the North Korean government are to blame. Finally, he expressed hopes that a negotiated settlement of the issue may be reached.I referred to the contents of 84 dated 18.10.76 and made clear that because Norwegian police had decided to take action it was highly unlikely that it did not have incriminating evidence. Furthermore, I told him that I could not engage in neither consultations or negotiations relating to the issue without orders from Oslo, but I promised to inform the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs of his request.Finally, I informed him that he would be notified promptly if such an order was issued from Oslo.[Ambassador Torleiv] Anda-----I am scheduled to travel to Canton [Guangzhou] tomorrow, 22.

In addition to accounts of the events, the Post writes that Scandinavian countries have normally sympathized more with North Korea than with its bitter rival in the south, but much of this goodwill has now suffered from the revelations of the illegal smuggling.The article also refers to North Korea’s failure to pay foreign entities, and views the illegal distribution of cigarettes, spirits and narcotics in light of these failures. According to the article, Japanese trading companies are pessimistic in their view of North Korea’s economic future as they are seeing a collapse in industrial management.

I replied that this was of course objectionable, and expressed my hope that no Norwegian diplomats were involved. To this he replied that if that was the case, he would have notified me.I went on to elaborate on the North Korean activities in Norway and how this stands in bleak contrast to the high moral principles to which the North Koreans claim to adhere. I added, in a playful tone, that rumors had it that eight North Korean diplomats had been expelled from the Soviet Union.To this he replied that North Korea was a special case strongly influenced by Kim Il Sung’s Napoleon complex. The rumors regarding the expulsion of North Korean diplomats were untrue. It was however true that some North Koreans had left Moscow as a result of their involvement in drug smuggling. However, not only North Koreans had been involved in this smuggling. Substance abuse was becoming a problem in Moscow and other major cities, even if the problem was not yet as widespread as in the US and Western Europe. It was on this background Soviet authorities saw it necessary to react with strong punishments for a number of foreign nationals who were involved in drug smuggling.To my remark that I believed all the foreigners had been in transit, he replied that for many of them, this was not the case. He also said there were also diplomats among the foreigners.- - -It seems natural to interpret these statements to mean that North Korean diplomats have been forced to leave Moscow after involvement in drug smuggling.

By the way, in 1976 the Soviet Union also fulfilled its export obligations, whereas Korean exports, in contrast to an obligation of 216 million rubles, were only 90 million. Since a substantial part of Korean exports is used for provisioning the Soviet Far East, failures in their delivery always cause considerable difficulties, mainly in production (cement, fire-resistant bricks, etc.), because [such goods] cannot be supplied from other sources without substantial delays. The Korean side will probably attempt to convert the deficit resulting from [the under-fulfillments of] 1976 into a Soviet credit.2) The Korean side is strongly opposed to the application of the price policy that is in operation in the COMECON, including the raising of the price of any Soviet export article. In 1976 the Soviet side did not manage to achieve the COMECON price level in its relations with Korea, nor do they expect [to achieve it] in 1977.3) The Korean side constantly announces new demands (in addition to the agreements), and impatiently presses for their fulfillment. They repeatedly and very emphatically urge, at every level, that Soviet shipments of crude oil be increased to two million metric tons per annum (the Soviets suppose that they intend to sell the processed petroleum derivatives in capitalist markets). For reasons of prestige, they ask the Soviet Union to build a nuclear power plant for them (the five-year agreement did not include this either). They disregard the Soviet replies, according to which they [the Soviets] are unable to deliver loss-making articles over the quantity specified in the plan. According to the information available to the Soviets, in [North Korean] domestic propaganda these problems are presented as the causes of the [DPRK’s] economic difficulties (the Soviet Union exploits Korea by raising prices, it refuses to deliver the goods needed for economic development, because it prefers to sell them to the capitalists, etc.).-Marjai-16- ",[],"['Council for Mutual Economic Assistance', 'Korea (North)--Foreign relations--Soviet Union', 'Korea (North)--Economic conditions', 'Nuclear weapons--Korea (North)', 'Korea (North)--Foreign economic relations--Soviet Union']"

According to our contact with Chinese envoys and members of the diplomatic corps, there has been an increase in the level of interest and concern towards the Korean problem. The dominant note of the remarks and observations emphasize the possibility of new developments in terms of the Korean issue, determined by Sino-American relations, Sino-Soviet-American relations and by the DPRK’s recent diplomatic initiatives. 2. The US and China’s insistence on reaffirming the validity of the 1972 agreements is interpreted as being indicative of both countries’ interest in settling the complex issues in the region, chief among which [ranks] the Korean problem.  Chinese officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have informed us that China sincerely wishes for the withdrawal of US troops from South Korea and Korean reunification. It is generally acknowledged that the Sino-American solution to the problem is currently benefiting from much more favorable conditions, both in Asia and internationally, due to: a) The Carter administration’s decision to withdraw troops from South Korea. Japan analyzed the decision. However a recent discussion with Vice President Mondale reveals that, despite assurance of a gradual troop withdrawal in close cooperation with the Japanese and South Korean governments, Japan is not as of yet fully prepared to assume increased responsibilities regarding the security of the region. Japan’s concerns about the implications of the US withdrawal for regional stability and Japan’s security are also underlined by the possibility of Prime Minister Fukuda to discuss such aspects in the following meetings with President Carter. b) Changes in the DPRK’s position regarding Korean reunification:- withdrawing the proposal to discuss the Korean question at the UN General Assembly;- certain North Korean officials’ visit to countries in Asia, Africa and Europe (Premier Pak Song-chol, Vice Premier Heo Dam, Minister of Armed Forces O Chin-u and others);- clear statement of the DPRK’s wish for political contact with the US expressed during official visits (Japanese delegation received by Kim Il Sung);- proposals addressed to South Korean parties and political forces in a letter on January 25.Such changes are based on the understanding that [being in favor of] a forced military solution has undermined North Korea internationally. This approach not only produced tensions with the US, but also reservations from Chinese officials and a lack of response from the Non-Aligned Movement. Significant for this new approach are the proposals in the January 25th letter, the fundamental aspect of which is the idea of an inter-Korean dialogue – an idea endorsed by China and the US, generating wide international support. China’s prompt public support of these proposals – considered just and reasonable – and the manner in which Chinese propaganda advertised North Korea’s initiative have been notable. China’s speedy reaction confirms that it continues to play an important political and economic role in moderating North Korea’s position. c) the DPRK’s economic hardships and the impossibility of overcoming them in the near future, as well as the North Korean Premier’s recent failed attempts to receive economic assistance from the USSR, are likely to compel the DPRK to turn to the PRC and other partner countries, as well as to increase its openness towards Japan and other Western countries. 3. In our opinion, it is possible to initiate negotiations regarding the Korean question, both in terms of American military withdrawal from the South and working towards a political settlement. We believe the US and the PRC’s actions to achieve their strategic objective of removing the Korean Peninsula from Soviet influence to be determinative. Concurrently, we believe Japan to be influential as it requires time to adopt the appropriate military and economic measures in concordance with its close ties to South Korea. Therefore, this appears to be a lengthy process (according to Western estimations, only the troop withdrawal itself will go beyond 1979), with various deviations reflecting the complexity of the issue, the large discrepancies between North and South, and the assortment of conflicting interests in the region.

According to the bilateral security treaty, the US will maintain its commitment to strengthen the security of this country and gradually withdraw ground troops in consultation with both South Korean and Japanese authorities. This position has been recently restated by Vice President Walter Mondale in discussions with the Japanese Prime Minister. The situation in the Korean Peninsula remains tense and explosive, and the US does not want to alter the military and strategic balance in the region through its position. The decision to partly withdraw American troops from South Korea is mostly the result of internal pressure within the US, especially after Vietnam, to maintain limited military presence so as to avoid a potential implication in a new military conflict. The DPRK’s recent four-point statement regarding contacts between various political and military organizations in North and South Korea is not concurrent with the joint North-South four-point statement and, thus, not viable. Furthermore, reopening discussions on the Korean question at the United Nations in the current context is not likely to decrease tensions within the Peninsula. The US believes that a first step could be made through a joint Sino-Soviet-American effort and is willing to have contacts with the DPRK as long as the USSR and the PRC initiate contact with South Korea.

According to them, this surge originated particularly after the North Korean Premier’s visit to Moscow in January this year, and consists of the following: politically, according to the USSR, Chinese support for the DPRK’s proposals for reunification issued on January 25th 1977 is ‘more adamant and accentuated than before;’ economically, the North Korean delegation visited China in view of scientific and technological cooperation, and, more recently, there was a visit headed by the Vice Premier who signed a long-term trade agreement. In our opinion, the Soviet concern regarding Sino-North Korean relations confirms what wider diplomatic circles have already suspected, namely that the DPRK was not satisfied with the outcomes of the North Korean Premier’s visit to Moscow, and that it is increasingly turning to the People’s Republic of China in the attempt to surpass its current economic difficulties. What we find significant in terms of Sino-North Korean relations is the recent meeting between Chairman Hua Guofeng and the DPRK’s Ambassador to China, who had just concluded his mission in Beijing.  Signed: Nicolae Gavrilescu","['Gavrilescu, Nicolae']","['Visits of state--Korea (North)', 'Visits of state--China', 'China--Foreign economic relations--Korea (North)']"

Edward Hurwitz, Director of the Korea Desk in the US Department of State, told Comrade Petre Anghel, Third Secretary, that the South Korean Minister’s discussions with President Carter and State Department representatives have managed to reduce South Korea’s concerns regarding allegations of a diminished US interest in their bilateral relations and in the region. US officials reassured the South Korean Minister that they will not proceed to an immediate withdrawal of American troops and that the process will be gradual, with the direct cooperation and participation of South Korean authorities. Concurrently, American representatives reiterated the position that the US will not accept discussing solutions to the Korean issue in the absence of envoys from Seoul. According to the US diplomat, the DPRK sent a message to the new administration via the Pakistani government, proposing to initiate a dialogue with the US in order to sign a definitive peace treaty and establish stable bilateral relations.    The US responded that it cannot accept a dialogue with the DPRK, which excludes South Korea, and proposed a four-party meeting to discuss a new settlement initiating a constructive bilateral dialogue between the two Koreas. According to Hurwitz, although it is difficult to estimate if and to what extent the DPRK will abandon the rigid position upheld hitherto, a less aggressive tone has been noticeable in its recent statements regarding the United States. In regards to discussing the Korean issue at the UN, the US would prefer a situation similar to the one from the last General Assembly. Thus far, American representatives have no knowledge of the issue’s inclusion on the agenda for the next Assembly. However, if this were to happen, it would only lead to sterile discussions and a potential intensification of the tensions in the Korean Peninsula.  Signed: Nicolae M.

The call made by the President Kim Il Sung, “agriculture first,” is still on.From the beginning of the year an intense activity is carried out in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to achieve the tasks set by the 12th Plenum of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea in October 1976. It approved the 5-point plan of natural environment modification as well as the call upon [the members] of the Workers' Party of Korea at the beginning of the current year to obtain 8.5 million tons of cereal in 1977.Completing these tasks will allow the accomplishment of one of the ten points of the development plan – obtaining 10 million tons of cereal. An emphasis is put on the prevention of the cold air front and drought. In this context, the agricultural year of 1976, when the peasantry cooperative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea obtained the biggest harvest in the history of the country – 8 million tons of cereal – in spite of unfavorable climatic conditions, is given as an example.In many articles and commentaries on the radio and television, an emphasis is put on the importance of the help offered by the working class to the peasantry. This support is appreciated as a “logical requirement for the consolidation of the working class-peasantry alliance,” “a main condition for the quick development of the agriculture,” and “a contribution to the acceleration of the abolition of the differences between the rural and the urban lifestyle”.After solving problems related to the irrigation and the electrification of agriculture in May, there are now new tasks regarding the chemicalization and complex mechanization for the modernization and the industrialization of agriculture.In his New Year message in 1977, Kim Il Sung highlighted the great successes obtained by the Korean people in accomplishing the tasks set by the Plenum of the Central Committee of the Workers’ Party of Korea in October 1976. In the last 2 months of the previous year, the surface of irrigated land has increased by 82,000 hectares,2,600 hectares have been terraced, and over 14,600 hectares of new lands have been utilized.Nutritive pots for corn are currently being prepared, the rice for seedlings sowing has started, and there is a large activity for pumping increased quantities of water in the accumulation lakes.From materials published by the [North Korean] press, discussions with the locals and personal observation, there is an accentuated drought during the first trimester that affects un-irrigated land and leads to difficulties in the electric energy production and industrial production.

During March 29th and April 5th this year, the Yugoslav governmental delegation led by Mara Radic – member of Government, President of the Yugoslav team in the advisory commission on intergovernmental economic, technological and scientific relations between the DPRK and the SFRY – was in Pyongyang. Given this opportunity, the first session of the aforementioned commission took place and the following [documents] have been [signed]: the first protocol of the session, a long-term trade agreement for 1977-1980, and a trade protocol for 1977. During its stay in the DPRK, the Yugoslav delegation enjoyed special attention from Korean officials, was received by Korean Premier Pak Seong-cheol [Pak Song Chol] and visited various economic and social-cultural sites in Pyongyang and Hamheung.Although the delegation’s mission was primarily economic, Korean officials sought to imprint a pronounced political character on it, and discuss not only economic matters but also aspects related to a long-term development of political bilateral relations and other issues. During the official and unofficial discussions, the Korean side emphasized the need to intensify activity within the Non-Aligned Movement in order to solve major current issues. On this occasion, Pak Seong-cheol showed that currently the main problem within the Non-Aligned Movement is maintaining unity amongst its member states, this being highly important especially given that the imperial powers are carrying out an intense activity to divide these states and undermine the movement.   The Yugoslav delegation remarked that its Korean counterpart did not make any reference to either Third World or developing countries. Discussing issues related to a new world economic and political order, the Yugoslav delegation wanted to know the DPRK’s stance in regards to Pakistani Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto’s initiative of a high-level Third World countries conference. The Korean delegation avoided the answer, only mentioning that, presently, it is necessary to meet the conditions agreed upon in 1976 at Colombo.On receiving the Yugoslav delegation by Premier Pak Seong-cheol and, particularly, during official discussions with Kong Jin-tae [Kong Jin Tae], both parties emphasized that bilateral economic relations are not commensurate with political ones. It was pointed out that neither party had made sufficient efforts to accomplish the tasks and agreements reached during Kim Il Sung's visit to Belgrade. It is necessary for the appropriate bodies in both countries to actively work towards developing trade and technological and scientific cooperation, thus also enacting the decisions agreed upon at Colombo in 1976. The Korean delegation expressed its conviction that the Yugoslav delegation's visit to the DPRK will contribute to the substantial improvement of economic bilateral relations. The Yugoslav delegation appreciates that the visit has been extremely helpful. The first session of the intergovernmental commission established the judicial framework of the commercial, technological and scientific relations between the two countries.   The Yugoslav party manifested an interest in substantially enlarging cooperation in terms of production with the DPRK. In turn, the DPRK was particularly interested in the matter. ii. During discussions for signing the first protocol of the intergovernmental commission, the following issues have been discussed: a) The DPRK wishes to obtain from the SFRY, or via the SFRY from the German Democratic Republic, the technology of coke production using anthracite coal. The Yugoslav delegation claims there is no such technology in the SFRY. However, in cooperation with the Korean specialists who are about to arrive in Belgrade, all possibilities will be examined.b) Cooperation between the two countries in the production of diesel locomotives – each will produce certain components and will trade specialists;c) Technical cooperation in naval construction. The DPRK will import ship engines from SFRY. We remind that several years ago the DPRK had imported from Yugoslavia 20 such engines, of a total worth of 5,500,000 pounds sterling, without reimbursement. The Yugoslav delegation required a payment of one million pounds sterling this year, with the remained to be reimbursed in a five-year installment plan after a period of 18 months from the first payment. The proposal is under review. d) The DPRK wishes to obtain technical documentation for the production of ships employed in deep-water oil extraction. The Yugoslav delegation explained that SFRY does not dispose of its own vessels and uses highly expensive Swedish ships for these purposes. Recommendations will be made for an appropriate Yugoslav organization to assist DPRK in the matter.iii. The long-term agreement stipulates: a) DPRK exports: machinery and other equipment worth a total of 1,000,000 pounds sterling; 44,000 tons of iron and steel products; 25,000 tons of electrolytic zinc; 140 tons of cadmium; 66,000 pounds sterling worth of chemical products; 460,000 pounds sterling worth of commercial goods; 40,000 tons of rice; 26,000 tons of freshly frozen fish; 950 tons of the common hop. b) DPRK imports: machinery and other equipment – no final figures have been established; 20,000 tons of iron and steel products; 5,700 tons of aluminum and aluminum products; 450 tons of brass; 10,800 tons of chemical substances – insecticides, herbicides, etc.; 450 tons of concentrate feeds; 640,000 pounds sterling worth of chemical fertilizers; 2,000 tons of various types of paper, including rolling paper.iv.

Glinski, recounted that both the Polish and the Korean parties have been very pleased with the Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs Wladyslaw Wojtasik’s visit to the DPRK. The DPRK has advertised this visit more than usual since it was at the beginning of the ‘month of solidarity with the Korean people’ and because the Polish Minister had made ample declarations in support of a peaceful reunification and Korean independence, immediate and complete withdrawal of US troops from South Korea, etc. The Polish diplomat noted that, during the visit, Comrade Kim Il Sung expressed his desire to meet with Comrade Edward Gierek, verbally renewing his invitation to visit DPRK. In addition to the general and well-known issues, President Kim Il Sung emphasized that the DPRK is currently in a difficult state due to the economic instability of 1976, when drought caused a decrease in electric energy production and, implicitly, an industrial slowdown. It was further mentioned that even today certain factories work only at 45-50% of their potential. Comrade Kim Il Sung assured the Polish officials that DPRK will overcome these difficulties and will do everything to acquit its financial obligations to foreign partners, particularly to the socialist countries.Wladyslaw Wojtasik agreed with his counterpart, Heo Dam [Ho Dam], to meet annually in the two capitals by rotation. Following that, in 1978 the DPRK’s Minister of Foreign Affairs will visit the PRP. Polish officials inquired whether the DPRK determined its stance regarding the potential inclusion of the Korean issue on the agenda of the next UN General Assembly. It can be inferred from the Korean Minister’s incomplete response that the DRPK will press for the enactment of the 1975 resolution on the matter.       Signed: D.

The North Korean press objectively presented the facts, without any comments against the US. During discussions with Ambassador Dumitru Popa and Victor Nanu respectively, the Ambassadors of Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and the First Secretary of the Yugoslav Embassy in Pyongyang noted that the calm and extremely balanced attitude of the Korean government regarding the aforementioned incident reflects, among others, the DPRK’s efforts of creating favorable conditions for initiating dialogue with the US. The DPRK’s attitude vis-à-vis the July 14 incident is also considered significant in view of US Secretary of State Cyrus Vance’s forthcoming visit to Beijing and the potential contacts between the American delegation and North Korean officials. It is particularly notable that, in comparison to other incidents, military maneuvers etc. along the Military Demarcation Line, on July 14, North Korean authorities were, for the first time, calm, compliant and understanding. Evidently, this is partly due to the fact that the US assumed responsibility for the incident. We consider this to be a step further towards establishing favorable conditions for initiating a dialogue to solve the Korean question.   Signed: Dumitru Popa","['Popa, Dumitru']","['Korean reunification question (1945- )', 'Korea (North)--Foreign relations--United States', 'Korean Demilitarized Zone (Korea)']"

Relations between the US and South Korea are currently less tense than when President Carter announced the decision to withdraw American ground troops from South Korea. The tension at the time was a product of the sudden manner in which the drawback was announced, without prior consultation with the South Korean and Japanese authorities. Subsequently, however, following discussions with American officials, the ROK came to terms with the idea of US troop withdrawal despite preferring otherwise. The Carter administration reassured the ROK that the drawback will not damage the military balance in the Peninsula and that the US will help strengthen South Korean forces in order to effectively replace US troops. The most delicate part of the issue is now in the hands of the US administration which will have to make serious efforts to persuade Congress of the opportunity for withdrawal and the need to offer additional military assistance to the South Korean government – in particular, loans for acquiring military equipment. Troop withdrawal has been another contentious point between the administration and Congress, which recently decided that every troop reduction in South Korea must have explicit Congress approval. Congress opposition against troop withdrawal is due to the large number of Congressmen who believe the drawback will instigate aggression from North Korea and, therefore, alter the fragile military balance in the region. 2. Recently, a move towards the idea of a bilateral meeting with the US has been noticeable in the DPRK’s conduct. Also notable has been the manner in which the North Korean authorities solved the recent helicopter incident, leaving a good impression. Nonetheless, the US administration believes it would be detrimental to positively respond to the DPRK, as long as the DPRK intends to avoid South Korean participation in future talks. The DPRK’s recent decision to establish a 50-mile militarized zone in the ocean is considered unilateral, arbitrary and against the armistice. The US administration has not managed to fully decipher the intent behind this decision, particularly since it did not affect the supply to several islands in the zone. The US Department of State tends to believe that the decision is simply the materialization of a Third World conference on maritime law.3. The US has no knowledge of the DPRK’s intentions regarding the next UN General Assembly. However, the State Department believes that the current international scene is not favorable for introducing a pro-North Korean resolution due to the ‘scandal’ regarding North Korean diplomats’ illegal currency dealings in various countries, as well as to the American decision to withdraw ground troops from South Korea, which is likely to reduce, if not eliminate, attacks against the US.

338,Bilateral Relations between the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the German Democratic Republic,19770815,"TELEGRAM 066700To: the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to comrade Constantin Oancea and Ion CiubotaruFrom: the Romanian Embassy in PyongyangSubject: Bilateral relations between the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the German Democratic RepublicDate: August 15, 1977Classification: SecretReferring to the current state of GDR-DPRK relations, the GDR Ambassador to Pyongyang Franz Everharz recently recounted the following to Ambassador Dumitru Popa:The East German government attaches particular attention to its relations with the DPRK. This includes the planned visit to Pyongyang of the party and government delegation led by E. Honecker.On this occasion, the GDR would like to have a high-level discussion regarding the development of socialism in the two countries and their foreign policies. The East Germans want to present in detail its position regarding relations with the FRG and West Berlin, and regarding German reunification. Something is currently preventing the GDR from placing the issue of reunification at the heart of its foreign policy. Although in certain aspects of foreign policy [in East Germany], the GDR and the DPRK have divergent views, the GDR believes a high-level meeting would strengthen the friendly and collaborative relations between the two countries. We [would like to] mention that so far the exact date of the visit has not been established. Although the DPRK is also preoccupied with and interested in developing its relations with the GDR, it is not active enough in fulfilling its obligations, particularly on the economic [front]. What is notable, mentioned F. Everharz, is the fact that the DPRK had not used the credits granted by the GDR approximately 10 years ago, and would now wish to make use of them but according to the initial conditions included at the time. For example, in 1968, the two countries agreed to build an automation elements factory worth 16 million rubles. Part of the equipment, currently outdated, had been delivered, yet the construction did not begin. Currently, the DPRK requested that the GDR review the project, with up-to-date equipment, but at the prices agreed upon 10 years prior. The GDR responded that a request on such conditions cannot even be taken into consideration. On the other hand, the DPRK has a series of debts towards the GDR. For example, the debt for the transportation of Korean commodities using East German vessels amounts to 12 million Swiss francs. The GDR was compelled to reduce the trade frequency from a monthly basis to a bimonthly basis. The East German official claims that the DPRK currently pays more attention to fulfilling its obligations towards certain capitalist countries. For example, in 1976, the DPRK imported 15,000 US dollars’ worth of commodities from Finland and exported a total value of 250,000 US dollars, the difference counting towards paying a part of its debt to Finland. The 1977 commercial protocol between the GDR and the DPRK stipulates 13.5 million rubles worth of trade in commodities on both sides. An additional 5.4 million rubles will be added to the Korean side as overdue debt from 1976. Until July 31st 1977, the DPRK will deliver commodities worth 21% of its obligations for 1977 and 43% of its outstanding obligations for 1976. By June 30th 1977, the GDR exports to the DPRK are at 75% completion. Hitherto, the DPRK has not delivered any amount of lead, talc or electrolytic silver. The GDR is encountering several difficulties in fulfilling its assignments and obligations within the CMEA due to the DPRK’s unreliable delivery of electrolytic zinc. Nevertheless, the GDR is sympathetic towards the current economic hardships [in the DPRK] and expresses its conviction that the situation will normalize in a few years’ time. Everharz mentioned that the East Germans consider this visit should yield positive outcomes in all areas, contribute to overcoming current economic difficulties, strengthen the friendship and collaboration between the GDR and the DPRK, and, as such, the definitive date of the visit has not been yet agreed upon. Everharz further mentioned that E. Honecker will make an official visit to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam in December this year.    Signed: D.

Recently, North Korea envoys have begun approaching the US again with the proposal of organizing bilateral meetings in view of discussing the situation in the Korean Peninsula. The US responded in concordance with its established position that it cannot accept such a proposal as long as the participation of South Korean officials is excluded. 2. Presently, the US has no knowledge of the DPRK’s intentions to reiterate its well-known resolutions at the next UN General Assembly. However, the US does not exclude the possibility that the DPRK will act around certain states in order to cause conflict at the 32nd Assembly based on these resolutions. If this were to happen, the US will proceed in the same manner it has thus far and ensure that a sufficient number of votes will overturn such resolutions. 3. The US administration is careful not to trigger negative reactions in Pyongyang and, therefore, proceeds in a prudent manner, leaving the DPRK to believe that the US is in favor of a joint dialogue with the two Koreas. As such, Helman emphasized that President Carter places great importance on avoiding tensions in the Korean Peninsula. Signed: Gh.

340,The People’s Republic of Hungary Minister of Foreign Affairs’ Official Visit to the DPRK ,19770831,"TELEGRAM  066711To: the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to comrade Constantin Oancea and Ion CiubotaruFrom: the Romanian Embassy in PyongyangSubject: the People’s Republic of Hungary Minister of Foreign Affairs’ official visit to the DPRK   Date: August 31, 1977Classification: SecretFollowing an invitation from the North Korean government, the Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Frigyes Puja, made an official visit of friendship to the DPRK between August 16th – 21st this year, in response to [North] Korean Vice Premier Heo Dam’s visit to Budapest in April 1976. The [North] Koreans planned an elaborate schedule two weeks prior: the Hungarian Minister is to be received by Kim Il Sung, discussions, visits to social, economic and cultural attractions in Pyongyang, and visits to Kangwon province, Kaesong, and even Panmunjom. The two ministries signed, for the very first time, a collaboration agreement for 1977-1978 on this occasion. The agreement stipulates the various visits that will take place in 1977 and 1978 between the two ministries, which include Puja’s visit to the DPRK and Heo Dam’s visit to Hungary in 1978, an annual exchange between the Deputy Ministers of Foreign Affairs, and exchanges between the Divisions Directors of the ministries (no particular divisions specified). Furthermore, a plan for cultural and scientific collaboration 1977-1978 between the two countries was also signed by the Vice Presidents of the Committees for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries. During discussions between the two ministers, F. Puja amply exposed Hungary’s foreign policy, aspects of the political situation in Europe in the context of Comrade János Kádár’s visits to Rome, Bonn and Vienna, papers of the preparatory conference in Belgrade on European security etc. In turn, Heo Dam emphasized that relations between the DPRK and Hungary are ‘excellent’ and continuously improving. During the first 7 months of this year, the DPRK has been visited by 21 Hungarian delegations from various divisions, and 20 [North] Korean delegations have visited Hungary. Referring to internal issues, the [North] Korean official noted that, among others, the internal economic situation is overall good. The current economic hardships both internally and in relation to other countries are due to the division [of Korea], which requires high defense costs, to unfavorable climatic conditions, to the economic crises in capitalist countries, and to other ‘difficulties inherent in our economic development.’ All these difficulties, mentions Heo Dam, shall be overcome. Furthermore, he claimed that the DPRK is currently working on finalizing the Seven-Year Plan for 1978-1984. Within this context, a series of aspects of the future plan for economic and social development were presented (see President Kim Il Sung’s interview with Japanese newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun – Rodong Sinmun – April 30 1977). In regards to the situation in the Korean Peninsula, Heo Dam mentioned that the US is strengthening their military presence in the region under various pretexts, including American troop withdrawal from South Korea. Expressing gratitude to the Hungarian government for supporting the Korean national cause, Heo Dam asked Hungary to continue its support for Korean reunification and uphold its policy of diplomatic non-recognition towards South Korea, to counter the so-called cross-recognition theory, to oppose UN membership of two Koreas, etc. The DPRK’s well-known position regarding reunification was discussed in detail. Heo Dam reported that the DPRK will not propose a new resolution project at the next UN General Assembly and will work towards enacting the one adopted in 1975. According to some sources, neither will South Korea; however, if it does propose a new project, the DPRK is prepared to act accordingly.Referring to certain aspects of the situation in Asia, Heo Dam noted among others that the DPRK strongly supports the people’s struggle in Indochina and all progressive movements on the continent. Within such a context, he mentioned that American imperialists seek to use ASEAN as a means of aggression against progressive movements in Asia. Recently, Japan has manifested an increasing interest in ASEAN countries, seeking to fulfill its ancient dream of becoming a leader within Asia, particularly on an economic level. The Fukuda Doctrine, according to Heo Dam, is an economic doctrine which ‘mirrors Japan’s policy of economic infiltration in Asia.’Referring to the recent changes in India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, the [North] Korean official noted that these are the product of struggles with right-wing forces supported by American imperialism in order to gain state power. In regards to relations among socialist countries, Heo Dam spoke in favor of their unity and against all actions leading to their division and separation. He noted that it is ‘particularly encouraging that the DPRK has good relations with both the USSR and the People’s Republic of China.’ ‘The DPRK is pleased that, despite the current differences between the USSR and PRC, the two are rightfully supporting Korea’s reunification.’ The [North] Korean official expressed gratitude and welcomed the Hungarian government’s prohibition of South Korean participation in all international meetings organized in Hungary, and asked that Hungary continue this in the future. F. Puja explained that they can only act in this manner when the organizer is Hungary. Concurrently, he reassured the DPRK that Hungary will do everything possible to prevent South Korean envoys from participating at international meetings when appropriate. In case of participation, suitable measures will be taken through the Ministry of Internal Affairs in regards to granting visas and other specific conditions in order to avoid any inconveniences that could be directed against North Korean representatives.     Regarding the Korean peninsula, President Kim Il Sung mentioned that the situation remains tense, with US imperialists preparing for a new war in Korea. ‘The propaganda about American troop withdrawal from South Korea is a scam, a lie.’ In fact, the United States is strengthening its military presence in the region. According to Kim Il Sung, the reunification plan requires, among others, substantial popular support from South Korea, where progressive movements are developing. Given the complexity of the situation in the peninsula, according to Kim Il Sung, the issue of the reunification [of the country] is not resolvable overnight, but long-lasting and enduring. Referring to issues of the international arena, President Kim Il Sung mentioned that ‘the DPRK maintains and develops bilateral relations with Third World countries in order to spread socialism, not to alienate socialist countries.’ The Hungarian Embassy in Pyongyang considers that the Minister’s visit to the DPRK has been successful in all respects. The visit concluded with a press release agreed upon by both parties without difficulties.Summary based on discussions between Ambassador Dumitru Popa and M. Macuch, Ambassador of SRC, and between V.

341,Regarding President Tito’s Official Visit to the DPRK,19770904,"TELEGRAM 066718To: the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to comrade Constantin Oancea and Ion CiubotaruFrom: the Romanian Embassy in PyongyangSubject: Regarding President Tito’s official visit to the DPRKDate: September 4, 1977Classification: SecretI. The [North] Korean party and state leadership paid exceptional attention to preparations for President Tito’s official visit to the DPRK. In terms of the number of participants, decorations, the pompous presentation of the visited sites, and inhabitants–costumes, dancing, singing, flowers–it can be said that it has been an unprecedented reception in the DPRK. Sources from the Yugoslav Embassy in Pyongyang informed us that an organization committee led by Kim Il Sung himself had been established in view of the preparations for the visit. Numerous efforts have been undertaken so that Pyongyang appears as festive as possible–billboards, flower garlands, flags, illuminated slogans, refurbishment, etc. Approximately two weeks in advance, Korean party organizations discussed Yugoslavia, its internal and foreign policies, and President Tito’s personality. Also unprecedented has been the number of participants–approximately 300,000 people at the reception, around 100,000 people at the organized meeting, and around 50,000 people at the artistic and sports event. The exceptional efforts undertaken by the Korean leadership ensured the utmost success of the visit; it is estimated that a new record has been set in Pyongyang in the last 5 years. According to sources from the Yugoslav Embassy, President Tito mentioned that, among all the 50 countries he has visited thus far, ‘the visit to the DPRK exceeded all expectations.’ II. Referring to discussions between President Josip Broz Tito and President Kim Il Sung on September 2nd, within a working meeting with Ambassador Dumitru Popa and Victor Nanu, Yugoslav Ambassador to Pyongyang Tode Vardjinsky recounts the following:  During one of their first meetings, President Tito told President Kim Il Sung about his visit to the USSR. Among others, he noted that a series of issues regarding international communism and the workers’ movement have been discussed, including Eurocommunism and communist parties’ autonomy worldwide. Tito told L. I. Brezhnev that he does not want to defend Santiago Carrillo because of his various mistakes, but acknowledges that Carrillo is right in adopting an independent policy for the Spanish Communist Party given the specific conditions in Spain. The independent, autonomous activity of the Spanish Communist Party constitutes a mobilizing factor for the masses and for all progressive movements in Spain.Acting otherwise means encouraging reactionary forces in their fight against communism.Tito and Kim Il Sung concurred that there is no such thing as a European, African or Asian communism, but only historical and socio-economical differences between countries. The Yugoslav President further noted that there is no need for a leader or a center of the communist movement. As such, emphasized Tito, the SFRY sought to include in the final act of the 1976 Conference of Communist and Workers Parties of Europe in Berlin a provision for respecting the autonomy of each party. The incident with Santiago Carrillo is an infringement of the final act of the Berlin Conference. Tito noted that the Soviets had made a big mistake in publishing the article against the Spanish Communist Party in Novoye Vremya. Although Brezhnev admitted to this mistake, he further mentioned that Carrillo was also wrong to publish a well-known anti-Soviet book. Novoye Vremya was compelled to counter respond and, as such, it became a dispute among journalists. Referring to the situation in Africa, Tito mentioned that reactionary forces in the US, Latin America, Europe, England, France and the FGR are actively seeking to mobilize in order to overthrow progressive regimes in countries such as Libya, Angola, Zambia, Tanzania, and to defeat democratic and progressive movements throughout Africa. Reactionary forces are very well organized, having calculated strategies. Hostile reactions from certain countries, including some from the Non-Aligned Movement such as Egypt, Morocco, Zaire, are highly threatening both peace within the region and the unity of the Non-Aligned Movement. US retaliatory forces together with reactionary movements in Africa have orchestrated and managed to overthrow some progressive regimes. According to Tito, given the situation, it is our obligation to encourage and support all anti-imperialist and progressive movements throughout the world. Kim Il Sung fully agreed, further proposing to maintain a direct and permanent contact with all the states in order to explain the current global situation and to mobilize all the Non-Aligned countries so as to defend and strengthen the solidity of the movement.The Yugoslav Ambassador noted that when Tito inquired about Kim Il Sung’s opinion on the People’s Republic of China, the Korean head of state avoided a direct answer, simply responding ‘You will go there and you will see.’ Referring to the situation in Asia, President Kim Il Sung mentioned that the Socialist Republics of Vietnam, Laos and Kampuchea have become free countries, but suffer from a series of unsolved territorial and national issues, which reactionary forces are taking advantage of. A military conflict in Indochina is possible. Kim Il Sung recommended Tito to visit Kampuchea, Laos and Vietnam in order to discuss and resolve the major issues within these countries without external influence (Soviet and Chinese). Tito responded that he can make some suggestions without assuming a mediatory role. Discussing the Korean issue, Kim Il Sung noted that the DPRK is willing to liaise with the US in order to discuss the problem on a general level, not in detail. The DPRK primarily wishes for American troop withdrawal from South Korea, guaranteeing it will not attack South Korea. For the time being, the US administration does not wish to negotiate with the DPRK in the absence of South Korean delegates. Answering Tito’s question, Kim Il Sung noted that the DPRK does not wish to discuss the Korean issue with Japan, the USSR and China. Acknowledging both North and South Korea’s interests in the matter, as well as the role of the United States, the DPRK is willing to discuss the Korean issue and negotiate with American and South Korean envoys, but not with representatives of the fascist leadership in Seoul until it has been replaced with a democratic government. Regarding the Non-Aligned Movement, President Tito emphasized the need to strengthen the movement and adopt more flexible membership criteria. It is important to be aware of more unusual situations; why should countries like Romania or Sweden not enjoy full membership within the Non-Aligned Movement? The Yugoslav Ambassador to Pyongyang recounted that prior to his visit to the USSR, President Tito received a letter from President Jimmy Carter, showing interest in the following visits to the USSR and China, and proposing that Tito discuss the real situation in Europe and the situation in Asia with Soviet leaders and Kim Il Sung, respectively.

As such, Kim Il Sung emphasized in a speech that ‘the Korean people will tirelessly strive to achieve exemplary relations between the two countries.’ On the other hand, Pol Pot underlined the close ties of brotherly and revolutionary friendship, as well as the militant solidarity between the two countries, based on the principles of ‘Marxism-Leninism and genuine Proletarian Internationalism.’ Kim Il Sung’s speeches delivered during Comrade Pol Pot’s visit to the DPRK reveal ‘the great joy of the Korean people to have such a strong ally within Asia.’ The speeches, as well as the joint press release, emphasize the identity of opinion between the two countries regarding Korean reunification and the socialist revolution in Kampuchea. ‘Protecting the territorial integrity of the country’ was particularly underlined. Among others, President Kim Il Sung emphasized that safeguarding the revolutionary gains of Democratic Kampuchea is ‘a holy international duty.’ In his speech, Pol Pot stated: ‘we will never attack or instigate aggression against any neighboring or distant country. We will never intervene in the internal affairs of other countries or conduct espionage operations in any neighboring or distant country. But we will not allow anyone to intervene in our domestic affairs and to conduct subversive or espionage operations against our country.’ We gather that the repeated references to Kampuchea’s territorial integrity in Pol Pot’s speeches are directed to the country’s current relation with the neighboring Socialist Republic of Vietnam. Referring to the current international scene, both Kim Il Sung and Pol Pot emphasize the enhanced role of the Non-Aligned Movement and Third World countries and the importance of respecting the principles of independence and sovereignty, territorial integrity, the right to decide over one’s own fate and non-interference in internal affairs. Both parties express solidarity with developing countries’ struggle to implement a new international economic order. In his speeches, Kim Il Sung mentioned the importance of the role the Kampuchean people’s revolutionary struggle played in accelerating the anti-imperialist emancipation struggles of oppressed peoples in Asia and around the world. Within context, the DPRK’s and Democratic Kampuchea’s contribution to the development of the international communist movement were mentioned. On the occasion of the Kampuchean delegation’s visit to the DPRK, there have been numerous references to the Asian continent. Thus, President Kim Il Sung noted: ‘the revolutionary process of transition from colonialism to a new, independent, and flourishing Asia was not easy. A fierce struggle between the peoples of these countries and the imperial and colonial forces is under way, like it was in the past. We will continue this resolute struggle in close cooperation with the Asian countries fighting against imperialism and colonialism, and we will build a new Asia, free from exploitation, suppression and inequality.’ Members of the diplomatic corps in Pyongyang noted the particular attention offered by the DPRK to the Kampuchean delegation’s high-level visit. In a discussion with V. Nanu, Liu Kung Bai [sic], Adviser for the Chinese Embassy, noted that Pol Pot enjoyed special attention even in Beijing. Pol Pot’s visits to Pyongyang and Beijing, noted the Chinese Adviser, ‘represent the beginning of a new stage in the development of bilateral relations between Democratic Kampuchea and other countries, and such visits will take place in many other partner countries.’ Signed: V.

346,The Official Visit of the GDR Party and State Delegation led by Erich Honecker to the DPRK,19771215,"TELEGRAM 066834To: the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to comrade Constantin Oancea and Ion CiubotaruFrom: the Romanian Embassy in PyongyangSubject: the official visit of the GDR party and state delegation led by Erich Honecker to the DPRKDate: December 15, 1977Classification: SecretFollowing an invitation from the Central Committee of the Workers’ Party of Korea and from the DPRK government, a party and state delegation led by Erich Honecker, General Secretary of the Socialist Unity Party and Chairman of the State Council of the German Democratic Republic, made an official visit of friendship to DPRK during December 8-11. The visit is part of the DPRK’s program of developing and consolidating its relations with socialist countries, and it is also seen as ""contributing to strengthening the cohesion among socialist countries.""Despite adverse weather conditions, the reception and all other preparations were not substandard, but commensurate with the standard level of preparation for such visits to the DPRK. What was particularly notable was that, during the two receptions, President Kim Il Sung spoke exclusively about bilateral relations, without referring to international problems, whilst Erich Honecker touched upon a wide array of current global issues. Referring to the organization, evolution and content of the visit, during a recent discussion with Victor Nanu, East German Ambassador to the DPRK Franz Everhartz recounted several difficulties in drafting the joint press release.The [North] Koreans, after receiving a first draft of the press release from the East Germans, proposed without further explanations to include in the final version only aspects regarding bilateral relations. Referring to similar previous cases, including the Romanian-[North] Korean joint press release of 1975, the East Germans insisted on also including international issues.    After lengthy discussions and President Kim Il Sung’s personal intervention in the matter, the [North] Koreans agreed to include aspects related to global issues in the final press release. During prolonged and troublesome negotiations over the final draft, it appeared that the DPRK did not agree with the East German phrasing regarding disarmament, contemporary revolutionary forces, socialist principles, and European peace and security. The two parties could not reach a consensus over a mutually acceptable formulation of current international affairs and of the situation in South Africa. Initially, according to the East German Ambassador, the [North] Koreans categorically denied mentioning in the joint statement any aspects related to GDR-FRG relations, West Berlin and the October Socialist Revolution. According to Ambassador Franz Everhartz, during talks between the two delegations, Erich Honecker discussed at length Sino-East German relations. It was noted, among others, that the GDR suggested several times that PRC end its public polemics, without avail. According to West German mass media, the PRC is continuously developing its relations with the FGR. Furthermore, Honecker brought up the PRC’s position against the USSR, noting that ""a potential war declared by the PRC against the USSR is, implicitly, a war against the GDR."" East German officials explained the GDR’s stance towards the Warsaw Pact, emphasizing its defensive character. Honecker noted that the GDR is ready to develop friendly and collaborative relations with the PRC as long as its Chinese counterpart also manifests interest in this. Within context, referring to the ""misunderstandings and discrepancies"" between certain socialist countries, President Kim Il Sung mentioned that ""such a state of affairs is regrettable as it negatively influences the entire international communist and labor movement.""The DPRK has close friendly and collaborative relations with all other socialist countries. They have always substantially aided the DPRK, for which the Korean party and state leadership is highly grateful. ""[North] Korea is a historical ally of the USSR and the People’s Republic of China."" Kim Il Sung noted that his country was freed with the help of the USSR. He further mentioned that geographically (a 1480-kilometer long international border) and historically, Korea is closely connected to the PRC. Following Japan’s surrender in 1945, Korea supplied China with a substantial amount of weaponry; Korean soldiers fought in China. Chairman Mao Zedong noted: ""The Chinese flag also bears the mark of the Korean soldiers."" In return, Chinese volunteers offered substantial assistance during the Korean War (1950-1953). ""Although we have close ties with the People’s Republic of China,"" claimed President Kim Il Sung. ""We do not agree with many of the Chinese leaders’ positions on both internal and external issues. We have not copied the China model in many respects. Nonetheless, it is necessary to maintain close relations with China. Having good relations with China does not mean we are opportunists,"" mentioned President Kim Il Sung. The DPRK does not agree with the Chinese position against the USSR. The Korean Workers’ Party and the DPRK government are promoting a foreign policy of strengthening the cohesion and collaboration among socialist countries. The DPRK wishes – and is acting accordingly – to maintain good relations with the USSR, the PRC and all other socialist states. ""Given its completely unique situation,"" claimed President Kim Il Sung, ""the DPRK cannot always be open about several political issues. Allegations are that the DPRK is pro-Chinese. Such contentions do not correspond to reality.""The DPRK maintains good and even very good relations with socialist countries, despite disagreements over certain domestic and international issues. President Kim Il Sung discussed at length the role and importance of the Non-Aligned Movement, the good relations between the DPRK and Third World countries, national emancipation movements, etc. Regarding issues in the region, the Korean delegation discussed the situation in the Korean peninsula, emphasizing the importance of bilateral relations. The GDR proposed enlarging and diversifying North Korean-East German relations. Thus, it was agreed that by the end of this year the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany present a collaboration proposal for the following two years, which is to include provisions regarding information and diplomatic exchanges.On this occasion, an agreement for developing economic, technological and scientific cooperation between the DPRK and the GDR governments was signed. The agreement stipulates, among others, that the DPRK use the credits offered by the GDR several years prior as soon as possible. Reimbursement of the credits at a 2% interest shall be deferred until after 1980. The GDR will supply the DPRK with equipment for the chemical industry, geological explorations, machinery, etc. Furthermore, the GDR will grant the DPRK licenses for synthetic rubber production and the oil industry. On this occasion, a new convention for consular relations was also signed.Furthermore, a long-term trade agreement for 1978-1984 is to be signed by June 1978.Erich Honecker proposed signing a treaty of friendship and collaboration between the two countries. Kim Il Sung accepted the proposal; it was agreed that the treaty will be signed during President Kim Il Sung’s next visit to the GDR. Everhartz concluded that Erich Honecker and the East German delegation are satisfied with the visit, the information exchange, and the open and sincere manner of the discussions. In turn, President Kim Il Sung mentioned during the reception hosted by the GDR that the visit constitutes an important moment in the development of a longstanding friendship and collaboration between the two countries.

Kunaev – the first secretary of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan, and member of the CPSU Politburo, recounted how during the Korean-Soviet talks (the Korean delegation was led by Pak Seong-cheol, member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Workers’ Party of Korea, Vice-President of the DPRK, the two delegations talked about the construction of socialism in the two countries and bilateral relations. ‘Given the divergent views of the two parties on some key matters, my interlocutor added, [the two delegations] avoided tackling such topics on, which [meant] that the talks unfolded without any impediments.’ Kim Gil-hyeon pointed out that this delegation was supposed to come to the DPRK on the occasion of the anniversary of the Great Socialist Revolution in October, but the Soviets sent another delegation, at an inferior level, on November 7th. Although the two countries have exchanged delegations on the occasion of November 7th, 1977, the Soviets requested that the aforementioned delegation visit the DPRK. ‘The [North] Koreans, Kim Gil-hyeon added, thought that, if [the Soviets] requested, then this delegation must be received accordingly.’Referring to the Lenin order awarded by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR to President Kim Il Sung on the occasion of his 60th birthday, the [North Korean] interlocutor said: ‘the decision was taken 6 years ago. But since then, there have been no high-level official visits to the DPRK.Now the Soviets decided that the aforementioned delegation gives President Kim Il Sung the order in question. We had to accept so that they did not return with it to the USSR.’ At [Ambassador Popa’s] question whether the visit of D. Kunaev is regarded as a response to Pak Seong-cheol’s invitation (Pak Seong-cheol visited the USSR in January 1977), Kim Gil-hyeon said that ‘we appreciate that the head of the Soviet delegation is, first and foremost, the first secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party in Kazakhstan and then a member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the CPSU.’ [Judging by the articles published] in the North Korean press, which released many materials about the visit, it could be noticed the official, reserved tone of [North Korea’s] assessment of the unfolding and content of the visit.In conclusion, we can say that the [North] Koreans were unsatisfied with the level of the delegation, as well as with the fact that [the visit] did not tackle [any] special problems which could influence in any way the dynamics of Korean-Soviet relations.SignedDumitru Popa","['Popa, Dumitru']",['Korea (North)--Foreign relations--Soviet Union']

Everhart, the GDR Ambassador to Pyongyang,  Heo Dam, Vice-Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, pointed out that currently several countries, especially in Africa and Asia, show tendencies of weakening support for the position of the DPRK on the issue of the reunification of the country; those countries are [also] re-orienting themselves towards establishing and developing relations both with North and with South Korea, which would sooner or later lead to the recognition of two Koreas.At the same time, with respect to the visits made by Pak Seong-cheol and Gang Ryang-uk, as DPRK Vice-Presidents, and Zan Zun Ghi and Kong Jin-tae Deputy Prime Ministers of the Administrative Council, as special envoys of President Kim Il Sung, to various countries in Africa and Asia, the Korean official said that the aforementioned visits are aiming at explaining in more detail the position of the DPRK on the Korean question and at determining large-scale actions to support the reunification of Korea.We would like to add that [judging] from the documents released [by the two sides] regarding the visits of the special envoys of President Kim Il Sung to countries in Africa and Asia, we couldn’t draw a conclusion about the purpose they served.From the conversations between Romanian diplomats and other diplomats – Indian, Egyptian, Hungarian, East German, Czechoslovak, etc., it would ensue that the abovementioned visits seek to intensify relations between the DPRK and the countries in question, to strengthen economic cooperation (which is partially confirmed for those countries they visited in Asia), to determine a more  substantial support [from these countries] for the Korean question, to arrange high-level visits to and from the DPRK, to discuss certain matters regarding cooperation within the Non-Aligned Movement.Given that South Korea publicly announced that it is planning to put the Korean question (including the simultaneous or separate admission to the UN) on the agenda of the forthcoming session of the UN General Assembly, it can be assumed that the DPRK is preparing its own point of view on the aforementioned question and in this respect, it is consulting a series of countries, asking, at the same time, for their support.SignedDumitru Popa","['Popa, Dumitru']","['Korean reunification question (1945- )', 'Non-Aligned Movement', 'Korea (North)--Foreign relations--Korea (South)', 'United Nations--Korea']"

Nanu that Soviet-Korean relations, following the visit to Moscow of the former DPRK Prime Minister, Pak Seong-cheol (in January 1977) and the visit to Pyongyang of D. Kunaev, member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the CPSU (January 1978) remain in a good state, experiencing a relative progress compared with previous years. Therefore in 1977, almost 30 Soviet delegations at various levels visited the DPRK, and approximately 40 Korean delegations visited the USSR. Since last year, 6 Soviet delegations (filmmakers, labor union leaders, economic delegations, academics, youth delegations, civil aviation delegations) visited the DPRK and 4 Korean delegations (O Jin-u, the North Korean minister of the People’s Armed Forces, the association of engineers and technicians, an economic delegation and a sports delegation) visited the USSR.Currently, Korean-Soviet negotiations on the signing of the commercial protocol for 1978 have been going on in Moscow for several months. The [Soviet diplomat] said that the negotiations are proceeding with difficulty, because, among other things, the Soviets insist that the balance of trade is balanced.A. Belyi said that starting on April 9th, 1978, the DPRK Ministry of External Economic Affairs delegation, led by Liu Kan-won [sic], the Head of the Policy Planning Department, will come to Moscow to discuss with the Soviet authorities the completion rate of the [A.L.D] (for 1976-1980), the prospects until 1980, including the use of the loan given by the USSR in February 1976.Moreover, at the end of May or June, a delegation of the DPRK State Planning Committee is due to visit Moscow to discuss the matter regarding commercial exchanges and economic and technical-scientific cooperation between the two countries between 1981 and 1984, respectively the last 4 years of DPRK’s 7-year development plan.[The Soviet diplomat] said that currently, one could talk about a general improvement in Soviet-Korean relations.When making this assessment, A.

Over the last few years both the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and South Korea showed a particular interest in intensifying their relations with Indonesia especially in the economic domain. In addition to several other objectives, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and South Korea’s actions regarding Indonesia, as well as other states in Asia aim to counter the initiatives of the other side. At the end of February, a governmental delegation led by the Vice Premier, Kong Jin-tae, Minister of External Economic Affairs of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, paid a visit to Indonesia where he discussed matters regarding the development of commercial relations between the two countries. In April, a South Korean delegation led by a deputy of the minister of the foreign trade might pay a visit to Indonesia. During 1976 and partially during 1977 the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s relations with Indonesia passed through a stagnant period as a result of the contacts that the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea had with representatives of the East Timor. The minister of defense of East Timor made a visit to Pyongyang on January 3rd 1976, however commercial relations between the DPRK and Indonesia have significantly improved over the past 7-8 years. In 1977 exports from the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to Indonesia amounted to 15,244,068 US dollars and the imports to 225,997 dollars.The main Korean products that were exported were lathes, steel, products of the heavy and light industries, agricultural products, especially rice – about 100,000 tons were exported in 1977. According to the [terms of the economic] agreement between the two countries, rice exports in 1978 will reach 200,000 tons.On the occasion of his visit to Jakarta, Kong Jin-tae, asked the Indonesian Minister of Foreign Trade to diversify the goods exported to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, and to export products like: nickel, cooper, wood, rubber, magnesium, pewter and petroleum as well, in order to adjust the balance of trade between the two countries.

The delegation was given accommodation in the rest houses reserved for the guests of the government. No Guinean communiqué of any kind has been published about the visit and on its objective and result.The DPRK ambassador was unwilling to speak, or provide information, about this issue to anyone, fraternal [diplomats] included. The Guineans also refrained from [discussing] the subject. In contrast with those news which suggest that the establishment of contacts was confined to the economic and consular spheres, the Western diplomats firmly stated, and still state, that an agreement was reached on the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries, and South Korea will dispatch an ambassador to Conakry within a few months. Certain capitalist diplomatic representations made considerable efforts to prepare the ground for the South Koreans among the Guineans and the DC [Diplomatic Corps]. During casual conversations, the Japanese chargé d’affaires laid particular emphasis on this subject, assuring [the other diplomats] that it would be definitely advantageous to Guinea to establish economic relations with South Korea. He also stressed that this would not be an extraordinary case, since the two Koreas maintained simultaneous diplomatic relations with as many as 21 African countries. To back up this claim, at diplomatic receptions the chargé d’affaires distributed a list that he had prepared, in which he enumerated the aforesaid 21 countries, including Guinea.The fraternal [diplomats] are also of the opinion that apart from the very advantageous opportunities for economic cooperation that [South Korea] had offered, the Guinean decision may have also been influenced by the fact that the assistance which the DPRK provided to the development of industry has ended in fiasco. Shortly after its inauguration, the factory that the DPRK had built in the vicinity of Conakry for the production of porcelain household and sanitary wares ceased to operate due to technological problems and the deficiencies of the mechanical equipment. (Guinea asked Czechoslovakia to carry out the reconstruction. [The Czechoslovak government] did undertake to accomplish that, and its technical experts have already started working.] The cooling of relations is also indicated by the fact that during the last one year, the Korean film shows—which used to be held on every possible anniversary, and at which the Guineans always attended at a high level and made extremely positive speeches that unequivocally supported the DPRK—have discontinued.The establishment of relations with South Korea fits into the leading capitalist countries’ efforts to provide additional support to their economic penetration through their smaller allies, by indirect means.

On the occasion of an audience granted to Victor Nanu at the [North] Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ri Seong-guk [sic], a head of department, said that the aforementioned visit took place in good conditions, yielding positive results for both parties.Starting from the fact that ‘the Mozambican government is pursuing an independent policy, that Mozambique is a sovereign country which is building socialism, that the FREELIMO party is a Marxist-Leninist party, the DPRK has had close relations with the People’s Republic of Mozambique,’ which, until now, have materialized, primarily, in frequent visit exchanges at various levels.At the same time, and for the same reasons, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea ‘has been providing and is ready to continue providing Mozambique with support in the building of the new society.’The Korean interlocutor said that the main purpose of the visit of the Mozambican delegation was to take note of the Korean experience regarding the methods and paths used by the DPRK to build the socialist society, to discuss and choose concrete methods of collaboration and mutual support between the two countries. Although endowed with important natural resources, Mozambique inherited a very low general level of development, as a result of colonial domination. For these reasons, the People’s Republic of Mozambique currently needs many cadres, especially technicians and engineers.Throughout the visit, President S. Machel sought to learn more about the Korean experience in training the cadres and asked for the support of the Korean government on this issue. The Mozambican delegation could have a first-hand experience of the DPRK’s practices on matters related to planning and coordinating economic activities, organizing the work [force], especially in agriculture, [and on matters related to] the results obtained in the work aimed at establishing a new society, etc.At the end of the visit, the following documents were signed: a friendship and cooperation treaty between the DPRK and the People’s Republic of Mozambique, a joint communique, a cultural and technical-scientific cooperation agreement, a commercial agreement, and an economic and technical cooperation convention.With respect to some of Victor Nanu’s questions, the Korean diplomat added that the documents signed [by the two sides] were ‘framework-documents.’ On the occasion of the conversations between the two presidents, it was agreed that afterwards, frequent delegation exchanges would take place, with the aim of studying and analyzing cooperation possibilities, ways, and methods, and respectively, to provide Mozambique with the support [it needs] in the agreed-upon fields, so that afterwards the necessary documents are signed, and the things agreed upon in principle on the occasion of the aforementioned visit materialize.The Koreans think that the visit was useful, that it represents a ‘new phase and an important contribution to the consolidation of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea-Mozambique friendship and cooperation.’SignedAmbassador Dumitru Popa","['Popa, Dumitru']",['Korea (North)--Foreign relations--Mozambique']

In this respect, the leadership of the Workers’ Youth Union had taken the necessary measures to prepare and offer the appropriate material conditions and transport of the delegation. During these preparations, [the leadership of the Workers’ Youth Union] realized that [they] were confronted with a series of hurdles and obstacles which could not be overcome, which prompted the decision that the Korean delegation will not participate in the World Youth Festival. With respect to the causes [of this decision] the Korean interlocutor explained that the main problem is that of transporting the delegation. Currently, the DPRK does not have long-haul, across-the-ocean, transportation means. In this respect, 5 years ago, the Koreans asked the USSR to provide them with a IL-62 plane, the Soviets, using different pretexts, did not deliver the plane in question, although [the Koreans] repeated their request and insisted on countless occasions.Recently, on the occasion of a meeting, a representative of the Workers’ Youth Union asked a representative of the Komsomol leadership for support with transporting the Korean delegation to Havana. The Komsomol representative replied that for the matter in question, the president of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers’ Youth Union send a written note to the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Komsomol. The Koreans said that the reply they received was not the one they [were expecting], and that this represents ‘a form of pressure from a big country which tries to prevent the trip to Havana of the Korean delegation.’The second issue which contributed to the Korean decision was the lack of financial resources. The Festival’s international preparatory committee asked for very significant hard currency sums, which are beyond the necessary amounts for past such events.The Koreans, despite the efforts they undertook, did not manage to overcome these difficulties – the lack of transportation means and of financial resources.The Korean Preparatory Committee for the Festival informed the International Committee that the DPRK would not send a youth delegation to the Havana festival.SignedVictor Nanu","['Nanu, Victor']","['Transportation--Korea (North)', 'Military assistance, Soviet--Korea (North)', 'Finance--Korea (North)']"

Moreover, the Koreans, at the Central African’s request, agreed to build a palace for Emperor Bokassa, in the style of Geumsusan Palace in Pyongyang. The Central Africans would provide the construction materials, the equipment etc. With a view to studying working conditions, and finishing the future palace’s project, a group of Korean specialists has been in Bangui since May 1978.A Korean economic delegation, led by Kim Gyeong-yeon, the DPRK Minister of Finance, left for Bangui on July 9th, in order to settle the  issue of the concrete forms of collaboration, the means and conditions for transporting the goods [traded between the two countries], as well as the issue of payments [for exports].

The [North] Korean delegation was received by Emperor Bokassa and by the [Central African] Prime Minister Henri Maidou; [the North Korean delegation] had numerous discussions with local officials and visited 10 industrial and agricultural facilities, among which the Romanian-Central African joint venture Lorombois. The Korean specialists pressed the Central African Empire authorities to provide them with details on the volume and guarantees for investments, the repayment of loans, the fiscal code, the profitability of firms, the special payments for foreign specialists, the degree of qualification of the local work force, the use of production on internal and external markets, etc. The [North] Korean delegation managed to get, although only partially and after extraordinary persistence, documents which touched upon, although only marginally, the issues they were interested in. On the occasion of the final talks, with Prime Minister Henri Maidou, [Finance] Minister did not commit himself to building any of the facilities discussed (the wood industry plant, the soap factory, the ceramics factory, and the irrigated rice farm). Displaying a certain degree of unhappiness, Henri Maidou said: ‘it is clear that there are still difficulties and complex problems [we] must look into, but the two sides must undertake immediate efforts so that the agreements signed in Pyongyang are implemented by the end of the year.’The [North] Korean diplomats told us that the Central Africans proposed investments projects for the aforementioned facilities worth approximately $22 billion, being completely uneconomical and unrealistic, without an economic basis [for these demands]. At the same time, it is noteworthy that although the DPRK delegation was still in Bangui, the Central Africans put special emphasis on their relations with the regime in Seoul, on the occasion of [South Korea’s] national day, August 14, 1978. The warm telegram sent by Emperor Bokassa, referring to the necessity to reunify Korea democratically, [and] the level of participation to the reception offered by the South Korean Embassy hint at the fact that the Central African Empire will continue to draw the two Koreas into a competition [against each other] so that the [Central African Empire] can extract as many economic advantages as possible.

The Japanese delegation, comprising 6 ministers, was led by Sunao Sonoda – the Minister of Foreign Affairs. The main point of the discussions was the peace treaty signed between Japan and People’s Republic of China, about which the South Koreans, led by the Minister of Foreign affairs Pak Dong-jin, expressed its concern regarding the possible influences over the situation on the Korean peninsula. Moreover, in this context, the Japanese minister Sonoda assured that signing the treaty with the People’s Republic of China will not change Japan’s position on the Korean question, but it will contribute to the stability in Asia. At the same time, he hinted that the perspective of establishing relations between Japan with the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is in the attention of the Japanese government. During a meeting of the committee for foreign affairs of the House of Representatives, one week ago Sonoda declared that the issue of relations with the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea can no longer be ignored. The ministerial reunion has not brought anything new to the issues of reducing the deficit in the balance of trade with South Korea which currently amounts to 3 billion US dollars. Moreover, the Takeshima island matter was not mentioned, both sides being aware that there is no mutually convenient solution for the time being. A new element in the current relations between the two countries was the proposal of the Japanese Prime Minister, Takeo Fukuda, transmitted to the minister of foreign affairs S. Sonoda, to meet with the president of South Korea, Park Chung Hee. The proposal was accepted, and the date is going to be decided by the [two ministries of foreign affairs]. It is worth mentioning that the last meeting of this kind took place in 1967 when the Japanese ex-prime-minister, Saku Sato, visited Seoul.Even though a concrete outcome on bilateral relations was not reached, the Ministerial Conference was considered a success by the Japanese because the South Korean officials expressed their interest regarding the treaty signed by Japan with the People’s Republic of China.

These relations continue to develop on the basis of direct ties established between various institutions of the two countries, in the following sectors: economic, culture, and mass organizations. In spite all these ties, the Korean Ambassador added, greater flexibility can be noticed in the attitude of the Japanese government vis-à-vis granting Korean residents in Japan the right to visit their relatives in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. With respect to the prospects of establishing diplomatic relations, the Korean Ambassador said that the Japanese continues its well-known policy of conditioning the establishment of diplomatic relations with the DPRK on similar steps being undertaken by socialist states in the direction of establishing relations with South Korea. This position actually reflects the wish to maintain Korea divided [intelligible sentence].Japan, at the same time, seeks, with [foreign] encouragement in this respect, that if US troops gradually pull out of South Korea, to replace these troops in South Korea. There are some signals in this respect, such as, for example, the participation of Japanese troops, the so-called defense troops, in the joint US-South Korean-Japanese military drills.The preoccupation of [the North Korean] leadership for the peaceful reunification of Korea is constant, the North Korean Ambassador added. In the speech delivered by comrade Kim Il Sung on the occasion of the 30th anniversary since the creation of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, new proposals were presented, which in essence, ask for the withdrawal of US troops, the cessation of any form of support for Park Chung Hee, which would allow democratic forces [inside South Korea] to take action in the direction of achieving the national desideratum, i.e. the unification of the country.

There are some cues in this sense, such as the participation of the Japanese armed forces, the so called defense forces, in joint American-South Korean-Japanese military drills.The Korean ambassador added that their concern about the unification of Korea is incessant.

364,TELEGRAM 066.982 from the Romanian Embassy in Pyongyang to the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs,19781102,"TELEGRAM 066.982To: the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Comrade Constantin Oancea, Vasile Sandru, Marcel Dinu)From: the Romanian Embassy in PyongyangDate: November 2nd, 1978 Classification: SecretThroughout 1978 there was no progress in Korean-Japanese relations as a result of the harsh and sometimes hostile attitude adopted by the Japanese government towards the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, on the Korean problem in general.As public materials and the recent conversation of Victor Nanu and Necula Coilogut with Ha Sang-cheol [sic] a specialist on Japan in the North Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Japan continues its hostile policy towards the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea – it actively supports the cross-recognition of the two Koreas, their separate admission to the UN, undertakes actions for the permanent division of Korea, for the maintenance of the balance of forces in Korea, provides material and political support to South Korea.All these represent a big hurdle for the process of normalizing Korean-Japanese relations, [and] establishing diplomatic relations between the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and Japan.Ha Sang-cheol [sic] said that given that the Japanese government promoted a hostile policy towards the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, the Korean government did not wish to normalize relations with Japan; this problem could be discussed only after the reunification of Korea.At the same time we noticed that the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea intensely tried to maintain and develop its relations with Japan and the ties with the Korean residents in Japan, on a non-governmental basis. As a result of the relentless activity of the Korean government, during the first ten months of 1978, 30 Japanese delegations visited the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, in addition to two delegations of the Communist Party in Japan, a delegation of the parliamentary association for the development of friendly ties between Korea and Japan, commercial delegations, co-nationals’ delegations. In the 10 months of the current year, four Korean delegations visited Japan, such as the labor union delegation and the delegation of the Workers’ Union of the Socialist Youth.A sustained activity is being conducted in Japan by a series of civic organizations and bodies, such as: the Juche Ideology Study Group, the Japanese committee of solidarity with the fight for the peaceful and independent unification of Korea, the League for promoting Japanese-Korean friendly ties, the Japanese-Korean association for cultural exchange etc. which have a loyal attitude towards the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, and support the position of the Korean government on different issues.As the Korean diplomat shows, the delegations exchanges, the mentioned bodies and organizations, and the sustained activity of the General Associations of the Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryeon), have the purpose of developing and consolidating the Korean-Japanese friendship, the collaboration at different levels, on a governmental level, the promotion of the position of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and of the peaceful and independent unification of Korea to the Japanese public, and the assurance and support for the legal rights of the Chongryeon association, defending the national and democratic rights of Korean citizens in Japan.As public materials show, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea supports such activities, seeing them as efficient opportunities and methods to maintain contacts and take action to create a current of opinion within the community of Korean residents in Japan favorable supporting the reunification of Korea, to determine a change in the policies of the Japanese government towards the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea or at least an improvement, for normalizing Korean-Japanese rapports.Because of Japan’s attitude towards the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, the Korean authorities encounter many difficulties: the visits of delegations are generally unilateral, the Japanese government does not allow the entrance of certain delegations and Korean figures; the delegations of the Korean Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee, the committee for cultural relations with the foreign countries, the democratic front for the reunification of Korea etc. were not given visas. When delegations’ visits in Japan are allowed, contacting Korean residents and conducting political activity are forbidden, and it is requested that the duration of the visit be as short as possible.Referring to the mentioned difficulties, Ha Sang-cheol [sic] said that “we were not discouraged, we don’t kneel in front of the governors from Tokyo.The actions and the position of the Japanese government are condemned by the international public opinion.We will continue to allow the Japanese delegations to visit our country.”Given the current situation in the region, the  Korean official added, “the friendly relations between Japan, the US, and South Korea, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is not expecting an improvement of the rapports with Japan.In conclusion, the embassy believes that Korean-Japanese relations at the non-governmental level, with all the known difficulties, are conducted in satisfactory conditions. Delegations of Korean residents from Japan, Japanese delegations from different fields of activity including trade are almost constantly in Pyongyang.The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is well organized, and has a great influence among the general associations of Korean residents in Japan – Chongryeon, has good relations and prestige among many influent Japanese figures with important positions in Parliament , Government etc.  Only this explains the large volume of Korean-Japanese trade which the Korean authorities avoid to talk about. (The total volume of forecasted trade for 1977 amounted to 400 million US dollars, according to some unofficial sources.)In this context, we would like to mention that the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea funds the tuition of Korean pupils and students who live in Japan. From 1957 until now, the amounts remitted by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to Chongryeon for education exceed 25 million yens.Even though an improvement in Korean-Japanese rapport is not foreseen, we notice that the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is conducting a sustained activity for normalizing, in perspective, the relations between the two countries. Compared with the previous period, we notice a certain change in the official position of Japan regarding the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. The Japanese authorities’ approval of the organization of the Scientific Conference on the Juche ideology in Tokyo in October, is significant in this respect.We believe that the relatively harsh attitude of the Korean government towards Japan is caused by its position on the Korean question; if Japan changed its point of view on the Korean question, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea would take more resolute actions for normalizing relations with Japan.In this respect, the fact that Japan is not interested in starting a military conflict on the Korean peninsula and that it does not want nuclear weapons to exist in the area must also be taken into account.On economic issues, [Japan] is interested in having good relations with the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, where it can find a good marketplace for Japanese goods.Even though until the end of the year a series of important American-Japanese-South Korean contacts are to be taking place, such as the visit of the American State Secretary [sic] [Harold] Brown to Seoul and Tokyo, the visit of the Prime-Minister Fukuda to Seoul etc., we believe  that in the near future there will not be [any] substantial modifications regarding the relations between  the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and Japan.Signed Paul Marinescu","['Marinescu, Paul']","['Korean reunification question (1945- )', 'United Nations--Korea', 'Japan--Foreign relations--Korea (South)', 'Japan--Foreign relations--Korea (North)']"

As early as before the inauguration of the civilian government, during the period of military rule, the embassy had established contacts with the NPN, which later, in coalition with the NPP [Nigerian People’s Party], won the elections.  In August 1980, on the invitation of the NPN, a delegation of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers’ Party, headed by CC member H. Sop [sic], visited Nigeria. The delegation was also received by President S. Shagari. President Shagari declared that the NPN was interested in adopting the experiences of the Korean Workers’ Party, both in the field of party building and in a few political issues.The NPN sent a delegation to the congress the Korean Workers’ Party held in October 1980. According to the DPRK ambassador, the Nigerian delegation made a very positive declaration at the congress, expressing its support to the DPRK proposal to unify the two Koreas on the basis of a federation. The ambassador evaluated the development of relations between the two parties as very favorable. In his opinion, one should provide support to the NPN, whose effort to unify the nation is a progressive political goal. Through the inter-party contacts, one could also influence the Nigerian party’s standpoint on international political issues. The Korean Workers’ Party was ready to share its experiences both in the field of party building and in the organization of agricultural cooperatives.Finally, the ambassador, in response to my question, remarked that they would not send an official delegation to the NPN convention to be held in December, because this event is not of the same significance as a party congress. [The Nigerians] would probably invite an official of the embassy.Concerning the relations between the NPN and the Korean Workers’ Party, we would like to note that to our knowledge, no other socialist country has established yet such an inter-party relationship [with the NPN]. (According to the Romanian ambassador, the Chinese do have such an intention, but the PRC ambassador has not managed yet to establish any contacts, not even social ones. His repeated attempts to visit the NPN chairman elicited only a polite evasive reply.)  It is remarkable that on the basis of the good economic and commercial cooperation that had been created earlier, in [February] 1980 Nigeria established diplomatic relations with South Korea. Its economic contacts with the DPRK are not significant; the political relations are more in the forefront.Frigyes Vadász ambassador",[],['Korea (North)--Foreign relations--Nigeria']

From the Ethiopian and Korean sources, which confirmed each other, the following information has been obtained:Both sides expressed their readiness to develop their political relations. To achieve this aim, they considered it necessary to clarify a few delicate political questions.The Ethiopian side raised objections to that the DPRK continued to maintain good relations with Somalia. The Koreans stated that their relations with Somalia were based on tradition, but they had disapproved Somalia’s attack on Ethiopia. For this reason, since then they have discontinued their material assistance [to Somalia]. Due to the division of Korea, they cannot go further, because they need the widest possible support to their policy [of national unification].The Ethiopian side also raised objections to that the Koreans supported the Eritrean separatist movements. The Koreans assured them that since the revolutionary takeover [in Ethiopia], they had discontinued their support to the Eritreans. The Korean delegation raised the question of why the South Korean embassy in Addis Ababa was still in operation, albeit [the North Koreans] had been given a promise as early as two years before that the Ethiopians would take measures to close it. The Ethiopian negotiating partner once again declared that they analyzed the Korean question from a class perspective, their relations with the DPRK were given absolute priority, and they would “restrict” their relations with South Korea, but they needed to wait until the time was right for such a step.   As is shown above, both sides dealt with these delicate issues in a very cautious way, appropriately evading frankness.

Munawir added that the fulfillment of this request would be difficult anyway, because the Korean question was deleted from the agenda of the first summit.On the second issue, they evaded making a standpoint by saying that if the right to organize the next summit was also given to an Asian country, then it would be unfair to deny Iraq, which had already made great financial sacrifices to arrange the present summit, this opportunity. The aforesaid result of the visit is remarkable, all the more so because one purpose of Kim’s visit was to make preparations for Vice-President [Adam] Malik’s trip to Pyongyang, which started on February 7th. Taking the close Indonesian-South Korean cooperation into consideration, it cannot be expected that Indonesia will make concessions to the DPRK at the expense of South Korea. Therefore, Malik’s visit is regarded as a goodwill visit, rather than [a political one]. Still, the Soviet ambassador does not exclude the possibility that during the visit, Indonesian-Chinese contacts might be made in Pyongyang.

He called for the withdrawal of foreign troops from every country. In the view of the Vietnamese, this is an anti-socialist standpoint, and actually it shows submission to the Western efforts. Even the Western observers are of the opinion that this standpoint is directed against the Soviet Union and Vietnam. Now the DPRK has launched a campaign to obtain the position of vice-chair in the [Non-Aligned] Movement as a representative of the Asian continent, after the summit to be held in New Delhi. Vietnam is of the opinion that if the Koreans [manage to obtain] this position, they will start undermining the Non-Aligned Movement from within, and this will endanger the unity of the movement. They called the Soviet Union’s attention to this issue, and also suggested that they should jointly choose and support some other candidate in order to offset the [efforts of the] Koreans. (Vietnam itself is also applying for this position.)All this indicates that—in contrast with the rumors that are also fueled by the Koreans—there has not been yet any substantial change in the policies of the DPRK.The ambassador said that the relationship between Korea and Vietnam was bad. Although Vietnam continues to consider the DPRK a socialist country, the line of the Korean Workers’ Party is contrary to Marxism-Leninism. This is indicated, among others, by the dynastic step taken by Kim Il Sung who has already selected his successor in the person of his son.China and the DPRK are in cahoots with each other against Vietnam, which continues to cause difficulties to Vietnam.The so-called “Cambodian question,” and the Korean standpoint adopted on this issue, creates a conflict between Vietnam and the DPRK.The Korean leadership is still unable to comprehend how Vietnam could gain a victory over American imperialism without the ideas of juche. This generates jealousy in the Korean leaders, and at the same time they must take into consideration that the ordinary people in Korea will contemplate that Vietnam has managed to reunify the country even without the ideas of juche.[…]   [signature](ambassador)",[],"['Non-Aligned Movement', 'China--Foreign relations--Korea (North)', 'Vietnam War, 1961-1975--Korea (North)', 'Korea (North)--Foreign relations--Vietnam (Democratic Republic)', 'Juche Idea', 'Nonalignment--Korea (North)']"

Their political and organizational work was aimed exclusively at imposing the peculiar Korean juche line [on the participants].The Cuban delegation was excluded from the committee in charge of editing the [conference’s] documents; instead, they admitted the Romanian delegation and the delegates of those countries over which the Koreans could exert influence. The Korean drafts of the documents presented the juche idea as a model for other countries, and stigmatized Western culture in general. Thanks to the action of the Cubans, the Indians, and a few other countries, the final documents do not reflect the extremist Korean views.The Korean side resorted to every possible measure to prevent the delegations from meeting each other, conducting discussions, and becoming familiar with the documents well in advance. The Koreans who accompanied the delegations forcefully pressured the guests to place the adulation of the “all-encompassing wise leadership” of Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, and the acceptance of the “international applicability of the juche [idea],” in the focus of their presentations and utterances.The delegates of a number of African countries were particularly willing to assume the aforesaid role, a fact that one might also attribute to the apparently effective bribery conducted by the Koreans.I will send a more detailed report by the next mail.118 – E.

374,"Hungarian Embassy in India, Ciphered Telegram, 28 September 1983. Subject: Indian views about the Korean Workers’ Party.",19830928,"Comrade Lahiri, the deputy head of the International Liaisons Department of the CPI [Communist Party of India], told us that he had been a member of the party delegation that recently, the first time after a period of twenty years, visited the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. The CPI attributes great importance to the normalization of its inter-party relations with the KWP, because the KWP exerts influence on the Asian and African parties, countries, and movements.The personality cult, the efforts to achieve economic autarky, the vague theory of juche, the unprincipled conceptions about the unification of Korea, and the Korean standpoint on several international issues, such as the Cambodian question, made a negative impression on the Indian party delegation. In a cautious way, they let their hosts know [what they thought about] all that.Nevertheless, the CPI will make efforts to achieve a gradual development of inter-party relations.  247 – V.

375,"Hungarian Embassy in Ethiopia, Ciphered Telegram, 26 November 1985. Subject: Ethiopian-DPRK relations.",19851126,"In recent times, the strengthening relationship between North Korea and Ethiopia has appeared in an unusually spectacular form. For days on, the television shows the film about Mengistu’s extremely spectacular reception in Korea in sequels. On his way home, the president was accompanied by the Korean vice-president, who since then has been visiting various facilities in the companionship of Mengistu. This delegation, composed of a high number of members, will stay here until the CC [Coordinating Committee, a.k.a. Derg] session that is expected to be held in early December.The Koreans provide assistance on a very wide scale:  A high number of small-scale irrigation facilities, a larger hydropower station, geological surveys, military equipment, marine fishing, and so on. From an interest-free loan of six million dollars, they are constructing a shipbuilding factory. The Soviet experts in the Ministry of Agriculture have been largely replaced by Koreans. These contacts reinforce the cult around Mengistu; in my view, it is not the ideological and political identification [with North Korea] that is important for the Ethiopian side but the fact that they regard the development of this country, which is comparable to theirs, as a model applicable [to their own conditions], and that they really receive great assistance. Of course, this might also open a way for an increasing political influence.114 – B.   ",[],"['Ethiopia--Foreign relations--Soviet Union', 'Ethiopia--Foreign relations--Korea (North)']"
376,"Hungarian Embassy in Ethiopia, Ciphered Telegram, 27 November 1985. Subject: Ethiopia’s relations with the DPRK.",19851127,"From a recently published speech of Mengistu, who is still touring the country in the companionship of the Korean vice-president, it has become clear that now he actually harbors even more grandiose dreams of industrialization than before the congress. It seems that this speech illuminates what has been hitherto incomprehensible in [Ethiopia’s] relationship with Korea. They probably cannot expect the Soviet Union to support these plans, and thus the propaganda also occasionally alludes that as far as industrialization is concerned, they rank Korea ahead of the Soviet Union. It is unlikely that they can easily launch these plans, since under the conditions created by the famine, many sensible and realistic conceptions for agricultural development were conceived. However, there is a danger that in the next year, the Western counties—if they become aware of this new line—will be reluctant to provide food for the famine-stricken people, whose number is expected to be, even in the government’s estimate, close to six million. 115 – B.
